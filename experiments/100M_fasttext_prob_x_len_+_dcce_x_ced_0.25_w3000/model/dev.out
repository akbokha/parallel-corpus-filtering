Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as T@@ ehr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it should also go about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s continuing settlement construction and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; through the deal applied by Obama around the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the US Congress which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this as a reference to Israel &apos;s forthcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , his girlfriend was shot to have shot &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his home . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house the officers found the bodies of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , which was cut on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to reverse , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mississi@@ ppi , already had 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular story professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Political Director Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cled him .
&quot; one day after shooting at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt herself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb pra@@ ising , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons , and said that he had any health problem . &quot;
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not guarantee an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs notion . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs lane when he returned to Mississi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb slept with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house approximately one mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he obtained his doc@@ torate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ term friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met through common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her playing the guitar for a few years . &quot;
he was the woman &apos;s war@@ rior at that time .
&quot; all the girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on res@@ ides . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously a couple of time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no document of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house , which is adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but because of his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail set up both on a summer market three years ago . &quot;
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September , after completing his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no indication that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were dre@@ aming and j@@ oked together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening approximately 900 people , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community participated in a candle light memorial service on the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the &quot; &quot; M@@ ahn@@ awake &quot; , &quot; while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; says La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mississi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans were contributing to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made an emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call was called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
&quot; toys R Us plans to hire less labor for the Christmas season , &quot;
&quot; toys R Us says that there aren &apos;t so many Christmas season employees like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it would plan to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . in the Christmas time of 2014 4@@ 5,000 workers were hired . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; the company said that this month it will begin with interviews , increasing the number of employees from October to December . &quot;
&quot; while the holidays are still months away , Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p stores with employees that sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated ge@@ aring and a arm &apos;s length of being with the princess of Wales at a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time @-@ driving film ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss again ur@@ ges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of meeting the General Assembly meeting this month in order to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; Ban has asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity to tackle the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dism@@ issed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks when p@@ olls down , it has ( yet ) not worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some start wondering what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at this time , Rick Per@@ rin &apos;s lead was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won only a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise dump@@ ing m@@ umps , and begin to run their dollars to overthrow it . &quot;
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
b@@ umps are turned 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures stand in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa announced last week that 60 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of tr@@ ump .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they would either be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Repub@@ lican voters say that they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans don &apos;t see m@@ umps as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 per cent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans ten@@ ding Irish voters believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , says ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the first electoral state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 per cent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of ten independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , says ABC / Post . &quot;
Repub@@ lican candidates get used to the idea .
&quot; when they put up their devot@@ ional hats , repub@@ lican elec@@ torate is Tr@@ ump to real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time four out of ten ended their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at that point in the last cycle , four out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters will see the campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump suggests almost everyone . &quot;
some experts suggest that the fragmented field probably contributes to the g@@ umps leadership while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other Can@@ did@@ ates .
&quot; but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ therine and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have issued their votes .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; nevertheless , the strongest competition in the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump on the issue of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called &quot; &quot; rap@@ ed &quot; &quot; was the immigration hub in the public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump crucial His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Repub@@ lican party and damage the new @-@ oriented efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ pol@@ l on Monday , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration in the lim@@ el@@ ight remains , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do too . &quot;
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son meanwhile accounts for about half of the support of Repub@@ lican candidates , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience . &quot;
and they are angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sylt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg there is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a prec@@ inct @-@ house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euro . &quot;
&quot; on Sylt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , i.e. in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations one square meter is the most cost .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; V@@ ölk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German housing sites - with square met@@ ering prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euros nix - per square meter , well marked . &quot;
&quot; well , who can afford it ... &quot;
by the way : Munich is not at the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ fold sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to FC Bayern 3 : 0 at Olympia Pi@@ re@@ aus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern in the witch seat of Pi@@ raeus a dream start into the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League in the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry hits ( 8@@ 9. ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth starting success in Serie is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot in Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; during his 28 hits in the Champions League for Bayern leadership , Müller received a tribute to the awar@@ ding aid of the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who left one as a flan@@ k of the world &apos;s champion . &quot;
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ahm had promised before the play at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six home games in the royal category , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 saw Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but the Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went courage@@ ously , but often too resour@@ c@@ eful in their offensive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were initiated too often by le@@ ver@@ aging on the left of Douglas Costa , which rarely happened against former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller left more luck from the right when his flan@@ k fell from the right half field in the left upper tor@@ ch .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion missed the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best opportunities in half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , as Olympic Games , Ide@@ ye Brown struck the Pol@@ es of Pol@@ es by the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct line , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians preferred to play a dominant game , Pi@@ raeus was able to pin con@@ i@@ fers . &quot;
but on the Manuel Neu@@ er go@@ al@@ keeper he was los@@ ers .
&quot; for example , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6. ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er Guardi@@ ola had a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was initially sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup Her@@ o was given the green light after the final training , said sport@@ sman Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; the go@@ ddess came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller ins@@ ist on it . &quot;
in front of the game it was come to Kra@@ w@@ alle in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly w@@ alled Bayern @-@ fans in their spect@@ ator block apparently prov@@ oked the followers of hosts Pi@@ raeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with cl@@ ashes against the Munich followers . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured in the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth ? &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lung , but also the teeth - this puts a Potsdam long @-@ term study close . &quot;
&quot; good news : in case of aband@@ on@@ ment , the risk is fast . &quot;
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smoking , smo@@ kers lay the risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.5@@ - to 3.6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had watched more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; main causes of tooth loss are cavi@@ ties and inflamm@@ ations of the g@@ ums , acc@@ entu@@ ated the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , acc@@ entu@@ ates the authors . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the connection between smoking and tooth loss is due to frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers . &quot;
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smoking , explained Er@@ stau@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must convince people of being non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained study manager H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; cigarette smoking dimin@@ ishes life time . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our findings also results in good dental health up to high age . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
earlier studies had already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet at Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer on remn@@ ants of the late Anti@@ quity
&quot; for the repeated time , arche@@ ological finds have been made in Cologne on the right bank of the Rhine . &quot;
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said Museum manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of construction works on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always consul@@ ted as an expert for archaeological ground conservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists have now been found . &quot;
&quot; text documents have already been known that there was a fortress in the place in the fourth century and in the 8th century , a church stood up , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to remn@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves that probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman captured by freight train

&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 o &apos;clock , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; by recording the train , it has borne serious injuries to the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated on site not@@ ary and brought by rescue forces to a hospital .
&quot; on the basis of the ni@@ ghtly cross @-@ crossing of the young woman , there is no evidence of the suff@@ oc@@ ating officers . &quot;
the incident could possibly be witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .

European Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; to def@@ use the dispute on the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function is significantly more traditional . &quot;
&quot; we want to set up a system to which the citizens trust , &quot; &quot; declared Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposes to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
TTIP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely determine that the EU states and the United States have jointly selected independent judges for a new European Court of Investment .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to rise against jud@@ gements .
&quot; so far , the parties involved agreed to each other on the refer@@ ee , a chance to asser@@ t their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussions of the past few months , it became clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström commented . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , they want to work according to their own data on an International Investment Appe@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there may , for example , settle disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) required above all are considered to be one of the main reasons for the major opposition in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , about which companies can tre@@ ad contam@@ in@@ ants of tax@@ pay@@ ers , negotiate national laws or implement a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
&quot; it has been critic@@ ised , above all , that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;
&quot; the German economic state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major step forward . &quot;
the Commission included essential points during the reform that signed the Federal Economic Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restri@@ c@@ ting the economics of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , the Wednesday continued to remain unclear . &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;

delicate Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy acting follow@@ er recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story of various places he repeatedly shows on the map , about his meticul@@ ous and delicate songs . &quot;
&quot; where they were born and how it looks there , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has been proving to be a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; wise composed songs , which harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , can be dri@@ fted into the great opul@@ ent at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or that &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a lost series : each of the 50 states should be followed in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive impact on certain expectations . &quot;
reduces st@@ ev@@ ens here .
&quot; live , his guitar and ban@@ jo are enough . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Van@@ oise &quot; ) , a celebrated masterpiece is published in 2005 . &quot;
over@@ flowing with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the US Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no annual list of the influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then served on &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic off@@ sets . &quot;
&quot; this sixth or@@ derly studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; long since the smaller clubs got up , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of Ne@@ on brow@@ bands and big fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co . &quot;
&quot; currently , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band . &quot;
in the dark @-@ kept Hamburg More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although here nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly mature st@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the wide @-@ enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and you can therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; record in essence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only to an enc@@ ore , St@@ ev@@ ens would like to be modest , acousti@@ cally plays a few older songs and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister has been anticipated with tension since his election .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo ship and set up with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch . his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from the vicinity .
he called for &quot; less theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to give her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to pers@@ ist on Tuesday during a commemor@@ ative ceremony on the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ okes criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the center of several cover @-@ sides @-@ stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention &quot;
a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ man said he would have been &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; &quot; independent &quot; &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve the top team in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked within &quot; &quot; Labour &quot; &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statement on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour made changes to remove the whole idea of limiting overall .
&quot; Mr Smith , the shadow work@@ ing- and pensions minister , said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has been T@@ ory boss over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policy approach , says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr. Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 requests . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington &apos;s North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo is con@@ front@@ ational , and that he will ref@@ rain both &quot; &quot; skill &quot; &quot; and the strike with with@@ ers , and instead decided to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister will represent him if he does not participate - for example , when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also taught the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the sub@@ house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; bar@@ ber theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s cargo ship . but a few years later , he admitted that he failed to do so . &quot;
&quot; as it was first sent on television in 1990 , the questionn@@ aire with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the sub@@ house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it became a car@@ ic@@ ature and expressed deep @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pound acceler@@ ates through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound mark@@ edly increased by data showing an increase in the growth of the UK &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller &quot; s bid target . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result of no bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % , after taking over the offering of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v . &quot;

&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers in the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s sold his assessment for the company rating . &quot;
JD Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .

the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will settle the higher labour costs at his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster introduces Lebanese to a Pot@@ ato idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
&quot; both - and in the pot@@ ato@@ ire twe@@ eter , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ propriet@@ or Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster on a Peg@@ ida rally with the inscription &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; , &quot; which he had seen on TV acci@@ dentally . &quot;
&quot; since then in his shop there is a barbecue , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is mul@@ ticul@@ tural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the Lebanese helped the Lebanese in the meantime at the Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; there , it has recently been protected as utility model according to the authority . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ h@@ ay does not want to betra@@ y it . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
the culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
&quot; Met@@ cash launches Ground Stand@@ ing campaign to fight Al@@ di , &quot;
&quot; in order to protect the IG@@ A branch from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia , Met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A branch . &quot;
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ based campaign to defend the market share of the IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build IG@@ A brand through mainstream marketing and marketing over social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough distributed in IG@@ A shops rehear@@ sals and shop owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of his defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment goes through its annual investors strategy day . &quot;
&quot; there is much in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shops and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two states twelve months after the opening of its first markets , and will remove all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that IG@@ A retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year , and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and food business and volumes on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed costs could cost around $ 13 million profit before interest and tax , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market share in the eastern states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent pol@@ l by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , i@@ gas market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which accounts for about 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , has fallen 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction at the same time pressure on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , hon@@ ors and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to deliver IG@@ A retailers to improve their stores by faster growing fresh food and deliver a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading @-@ refurb@@ ishment programs are to be set up , and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism of his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise for his own behaviour according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with the not@@ orious conflict of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , and Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ os and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a Kr@@ amp@@ f scored a potential US Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing I &apos;m going to do is the fact that according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi has gone a little into the argument , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a m@@ allet when he lost in the US Open because of a fight , but he is not the first player to have broken a rac@@ quet of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated too severely . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Kyr@@ gy@@ z on the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday and describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part into the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the lim@@ el@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I consider him appropriate , and it is best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency status , closes the border , holds refugees back &quot;
Hungary explains the state of emergency and sm@@ iled the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos follows the border , when hundreds of migrants accum@@ ulate in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted ser@@ bian officials with indign@@ ation . &quot;
people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; and sm@@ ash ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some rejected protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would return , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days , discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc with a controversial meeting in Brussels not able to agree on a joint immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the outdated Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU countries would receive more 1@@ 20.000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria asked on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a swift action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency situation , called on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities greater powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the forthcoming economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence built by the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher sentences for condemned human traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in custody and are accused of off@@ ending criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
authorities are ready to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounding the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to deal with people &apos;s data and press a crowd to push themselves there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to get into , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey half
&quot; the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to ground . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is the candidate for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more resistant in their choice than those of the other Can@@ did@@ ates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders generated some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton keeps a big advantage over women and moder@@ ates , but these le@@ aps have reduced . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters less than 50 years has ev@@ apor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
but Clinton still has a big advantage over the older voters .
&quot; last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries state that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when nominated by the party .
&quot; a quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her , because she is the candidate . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Repub@@ lican voters say this over their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question , why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters are also mentioned by Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to deal with the problems and the vot@@ ability are also cited .
&quot; as the Vice President thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office into the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third thinks he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters of the elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of S@@ anders increases from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters consider Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , at the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries was unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important features in voters of the prim@@ aries of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities will regard Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den cuts the three candidates best with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him . &quot;
&quot; in general , democratic voters of the pres@@ election also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters did not think of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an external minister , most democr@@ ats of the elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions . &quot;
but it &apos;s another story in the American public .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; public opinion on this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on the general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 per cent of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 per cent of the voters throughout the country see also Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good scores for leadership . &quot;
&quot; from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority sees S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many don &apos;t think of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 democr@@ ats voters in the pre @-@ elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves close to Donald Tr@@ ump in nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the recent C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Repub@@ lican voters will continue to support nationwide tr@@ ump in large numbers . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey carried out recently by Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey from Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demographic groups and sur@@ passed Tr@@ ump among repub@@ lican candidates with university education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio governor John Ka@@ uns , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the deepest , and 10 % support last month now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are 6 % on third place . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Repub@@ lican candidates in this latest pol@@ l is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in surveys - with 19 % support from the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view to a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ fts for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question g@@ umps faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood loaded with the death of a Bar@@ uch college virgin
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ di@@ ous ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five persons are filed . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood interven@@ ed Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ceremony in September 2013 , and delayed his transfer to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a goal . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was f@@ ain@@ ted and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , said Chief Apostle Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide the imple@@ ments and ordered the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said politi@@ cian Wagner . &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died the next morning on his injuries .
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeatedly fast@@ ened with mu@@ te force of injuries to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the fr@@ at@@ ernity of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the chic@@ ane every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for murder of the third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for criminal attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or un@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
Bar@@ uch college has banned the Brotherhood and the national br@@ otherhood re@@ vo@@ ke its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a raise of interest is coming , and the hou@@ seb@@ o@@ at will go bank@@ rupt , returns for loans will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance on how to proceed . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have so v@@ ehem@@ ently emphasized that investors should not concentrate on when they begin to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of interest in interest . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a lower level , in order to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rates can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency for asset recovery from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a newer study to what happens after the F@@ ed interest rate . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , in the past 35 years , the market is mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six previous cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the raising cycle , and the return on it begins to decrease . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point with a zinc increase in the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rates since 1950 had only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest rates in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw up the question , &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have made a stake in the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week that ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all In@@ cre@@ asing cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly put in the shade after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market sells a stake of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the ren@@ ders seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease takes place in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to closer cooperation between longer and shorter loans and lead to a down@@ turn in the curve .
&quot; highly @-@ consuming bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit tension has expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed is shar@@ pen@@ ing its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and all over the world , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the USA will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts will be worse , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market , as well as the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ Analy@@ st said in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity with their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will become a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most , &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit by the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings could see profits by higher yields , even if experts have different opinions about how fast this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says S &amp; D member Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critici@@ zed the &quot; &quot; sender &quot; &quot; because of his &quot; &quot; reduction &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; says a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private traveler does not do . &quot;
&quot; conserv@@ atives , Andrew B@@ ingham , also said to the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ law radi@@ os@@ ender is &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ is@@ hable from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards that started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC Director General rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from his commercial competi@@ tor when it comes to live music and education .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m not going to learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to put new works on behalf , I really consider it important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er must be worked on getting the audience involved as it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
&quot; Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George , was &quot; &quot; produced in a special BBC manner &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he added , he hopes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit out of our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when it comes to an entertainment series next time . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee ah@@ ler for other entertainment formats . &quot;
net sales increased in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest income since the record began in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down spending in November
&quot; for over a decade , virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
overall spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are indications that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G Sales Board . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers began making purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this comm@@ utes , and we may experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for failing sales .
&quot; experts believe buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers hit their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some merchants &apos; websites fell off . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers strug@@ gled for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a British Retail Con@@ sortium produced a study of £ 5 spending a little over £ 1 online .
&quot; for some products such as television and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now being carried out via web @-@ shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of men buy clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 deaths are borne by Muslims during the first burial in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia partially ob@@ stru@@ cts the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered together as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the slain that were killed when a crane sent to Mec@@ ca &apos;s wholesale mos@@ que .
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the way to pay for their respect , when the first of the dead came their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance gra@@ vey@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession went on to the holy place , where only days before a building crane rus@@ hed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral as the Saudi King over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction . &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 que@@ ens who were killed when a crane rus@@ hed through the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ ad will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
&quot; today King Sal@@ man said , the Bin Laden Group would not have stopped the arm of the crane than he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree , published by the State of the Saudi Press Agency , said the bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man v@@ owed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the Grand Mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims face the H@@ add@@ sch , who later takes place this month . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for comment . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also repro@@ ached the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounded Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ m as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased Chief of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an ab@@ dic@@ ated son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is necessary at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials ordered 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) to pay to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injuries will receive half of this amount .

&quot; if you are sk@@ ill@@ fully used with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , nowadays you belong to a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; because Brit@@ ons increasingly employ arti@@ sans to carry home work jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the Baum@@ holder chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops which are aimed at arti@@ sans and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are taken by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the men predomin@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends , which show more female single households who make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches .
we need to shift this more strongly towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions about purchasing articles by women . &quot;
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , which is one of only five women at the top of a British company in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher is the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial support . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales after the group failed to shoulder the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; due to the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; at the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt , two officials of the Austrian Volleyball runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and deportation . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them had also been accused of abuse .
he has been vali@@ dly acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial has been postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 were allowed to disp@@ ose of funds from club accounts on which they could disp@@ ose of their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; he def@@ ends the damage with around 400@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
the sports function@@ aries are also accused of financial off@@ ences .
&quot; this fact was divided by the chair@@ person of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ath , the judge of Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; to blame the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that the association did not develop an asset in no time . &quot;
&quot; the sports function@@ aries had only charged expenses and the sports club , for whom they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , came out of debt - the liabilities amounted to around 60@@ 0.000 sch@@ illing in 2001 ( R@@ d . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we continue or lock the club ? &quot; , &quot; one of the defend@@ ants , in the case of a bar@@ ge of bar@@ ric@@ ades , told the Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have taken money , our life insurance policies as security at the bank , &quot; he said in the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debt can be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of the expenses incurred by the reimbur@@ sement of expenses was determined retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; this is why we have paid off a part of the expenses only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was on the account . &quot;
&quot; as a result , l@@ ump sum and not detail devi@@ ations seemed to be explained , the former ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
accounts and spar@@ es managed the two defend@@ ants together and the second defend@@ ant said .
&quot; why the withdrawal of the association was not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in the details of financial arm@@ aments , important is only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 , against the one function@@ ary investigation for abuse began , an amount of € 1@@ 20.000 was transferred to the club account . &quot;
&quot; these were appropri@@ ations , the defend@@ ants said . &quot;
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent knew no answer for a long time .
&quot; then he finally thought , he believed that this was the best thing for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified herself . &quot;
&quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why in@@ dem@@ nity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association never had any damage . &quot;
&quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With him you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he had never obtained a cent salary , he only charged mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; he added 1,000 euros per month to the association , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not able to show exact documents for the early years .
&quot; these were no longer kept after an audit in which everything had been judged correctly , they said . &quot;
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; all accommodation must be made in cash , in addition to which he must go to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , he stated in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard supplies more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to personnel mines that have been running for three years , the computer giant will remove further jobs during spl@@ itting up the company . &quot;
the positions at the US computer giant Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; within the framework of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the move will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will drop from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;
&quot; after that , the Hew@@ lett Packard @-@ share gave 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; headquartered in Pal@@ o Alto , California , the company is currently spl@@ itting itself into a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business units should be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; a again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services , put the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to the latest . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; thus , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP respon@@ ds with a spl@@ itting and massive uph@@ eav@@ al on the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man responded quickly to buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and getting more and more business alike .
&quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 points . &quot;
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mostly result in rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent agreed . &quot;
&quot; the fact that other states fly air strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; a collaboration with Syrian authorities Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad would reject 51 percent of those survey@@ ed , 20 percent would be . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
car : second day of the day at the 6@@ 6. IA@@ A
&quot; up to 27 September , networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility are at the centre of the fair . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; mobility &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the general public can attend the IA@@ A from Saturday onwards .
&quot; the organizers of the V@@ DA Automotive Association expect two years ago , with about 900 000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence against Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
&quot; at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ shed , the Hungarian police have deployed several hundred refugees . &quot;
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the break @-@ off at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke out the border .
behind the police line there was a police line and behind the police officers a water@@ shed was ready .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially put an un@@ interrupted pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn a little bit back .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
&quot; children , who had breath@@ ed the tear gas , cried . &quot;
other refugees stuck together and suffered from lack of breath .
also the Serbian police spokes@@ persons suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .

&quot; the world is watching when the US not@@ ary arrives on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest has been raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists inter@@ rog@@ ated by Reuters has found out that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will continue to pers@@ ist , now think that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent will be held . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest sat on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , head of staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw outlook on global relationships . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he &quot; &quot; pity &quot; &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; &quot; said the authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Mississi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , he shot on someone and killed one . &quot;
&quot; lamb said to the cler@@ k of the emergency centre , that the police must send police to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
there was no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police came into the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could undo it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb took 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen enc@@ ir@@ cled him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs notion . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; at the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he did not go to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later at that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in spring 2015 , Lamb received a Ph.@@ D. degree from Delta State University , as his life lau begins at the University &apos;s website . &quot;

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
&quot; 150 of the world &apos;s around 1,000 executives worldwide will cost the workplace . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot;
&quot; the Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure , evaluating the low @-@ lig@@ th Euro@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is an earnings contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and income syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa will no longer have a board for the passenger &apos;s business in the future . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independently as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings by CEO Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r highlights the importance of Euro@@ wings with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120,000 staff of strong company was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operated under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group pass , which represents three quarters of annual revenues of EUR 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with pilots
&quot; in the collective conflict with the cock@@ pit ( VC ) pilot re@@ unification , negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the first strike on Thursday . &quot;
that divided the union .
the theme of the talks shall be the retirement control for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result &quot; &quot; cock@@ pit &quot; &quot; will come to viable results as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , the conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; Wings &quot; austerity concept . &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is reloc@@ ating to the Euro@@ wings group@@ ing line . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
&quot; in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven . &quot;
&quot; while this puts the left outside def@@ ender to we@@ eping and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
&quot; the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area . &quot;
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double re@@ fraction and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operates in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then plays fantastic , and then happens . &quot;
&quot; in the locker room , he had an oxygen mask . &quot;
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then takes the six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape a Red Card and the im@@ position of an el@@ k .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
here : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the PS@@ V &apos;s defeat
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK def@@ ender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming of June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you hear that it &apos;s a very bad hurt , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball rolling in a different direction so that it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ dering by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child falls in love with a book , it will not take long before you get to know it . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided on The Lor@@ ax , the eco @-@ label published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book , instead reproduced an abstr@@ action of the movie version of 2012 , added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree . &quot;
&quot; as though this would not be suspic@@ ious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is not so familiar with the plot of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is rav@@ aged by the money @-@ gre@@ edy , trees , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , car@@ ving being , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot; &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR assignment was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing @-@ Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was likely to come from Cameron &apos;s election circuit .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons employees , but gave no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the Ka@@ der who chose England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on a test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
this is related to Adam Ly@@ th from England &apos;s test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to permit Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ ck@@ et@@ ers are based on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination as - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; hopefully other Yor@@ k@@ shire seeds will come out , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not bring so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question how much time a test drummer gets to put his character is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and away .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation you can raise was that England first bet Jon@@ ah in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer I cher@@ ish very much .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this naturally depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat mos@@ ques next to Cook , causing an extra spin @-@ off Bow@@ ler and get four Qu@@ icks , di@@ ved , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t hit there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my earlier team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first Drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he made three hundred R@@ uns immediately and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made some wise additions to the Train@@ erst@@ ab . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games might be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
&quot; I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the aforementioned . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you need to think that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly in the heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it War@@ ehouse ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Out of Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy was in a F@@ lau@@ te until 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ equi@@ vocal ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will go deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which is severely dist@@ ressed because of Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend re@@ affir@@ med that some member states , so deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always of their own fault , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing treaty changes that they mostly do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting , that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and finance ministers climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes a great Britain looking to the outside of the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it is bad for her , as it is for the exagger@@ ated long periods such as th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande has a look at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a da@@ zz@@ ling force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; that is why some such ministers may even deliberately plan a pur@@ pos@@ eful note , especially in the SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s refer@@ ral campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy , &quot; and &quot; Britain did not gain anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press zone , as they did during the referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , who supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can get weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists , who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ ana &quot; in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; with all his mad@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vill@@ ains , phone @-@ h@@ acking aliens and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nation@@ als who have most of our big newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air thought about her , but found that when one sits in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , one gets better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of getting his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ air than Bl@@ air himself when he opposed Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s referendum , because Bl@@ air had set the principle about the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , thereby opening a back door to him . &quot;
the press has never with@@ drawn him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly sla@@ p on the back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needed to waste time for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the eigh@@ ties , an error back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I just press it friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside the U@@ ki@@ ps traditional ves@@ icle trend and the wild li@@ ds of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the seventy years when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; remain under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on their meeting on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey , remember that he even stir@@ red me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe , allowing him to support Lab@@ ours in the refer@@ endu@@ ms campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which reminded me of something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; he published the &quot; &quot; base article &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial in the medical journal of the Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; indeed , this statement from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision @-@ making analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to perform their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine content products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing directors had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes producer , but not the funding he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the meeting .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; is significant , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for most products in most of the criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the alleg@@ ations of p@@ he that &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous obligation to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die each year in a disease with reference to smoking , and smoking is the cost of the National Health System for two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national competence . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ gate , says former manager of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; &quot; give their right arm &quot; &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs which are not sent by other UK transm@@ itters .
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ itters like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get into contact with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or send , which would also be clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communications Committee as part of its investigation into the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the radio charge , what I don &apos;t think about a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least make your production on programs that others do not do or put on commission . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach the wid@@ est possible support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financing programs that could also be funded without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ Calendar is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I am tired to see how this public television should be .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long term support . &quot;
&quot; his comment@@ aries on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC give that again what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ cheap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue if they go on their holy missions to justification of 4 billion £ ro@@ unding fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , you all think we all think that for 150 £ a year you get a great value , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot , ask me if that &apos;s right , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 CEO David El@@ stein , who also testi@@ fied before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to educ@@ ate , train and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would now officially classi@@ fy as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example on the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the pro@@ ms that he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alliances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have been cultiv@@ ating worms with gene@@ tically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they have to be heard with sound impulses , which have too high frequencies for human ear to be heard . &quot;
impulses work by switching Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ asonic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method , called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms do not normally respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani stated that they did if they were surrounded by a liquid containing micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures , which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms cells . &quot;
the sound waves bring about the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ als carry . &quot;
&quot; when it applies ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the modified mot@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that has to be revealed to the desired position in the brain at an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered tissue and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added . &quot;

&quot; but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains , which require a second look . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that was around the advertising for the trade fair - through a void of the ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign to avoid them . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ y corporate advertising , but &quot; through the blu@@ eness with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is a stri@@ ding of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally at our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for life in student residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anno@@ yed - and the numerous , lengthy dis@@ comfort over others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance to student residence halls ranges from slightly ner@@ ving up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to spice up : people tell where you come from , whether and where you took Sab@@ bat@@ ala , where you are standing in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love or hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract H@@ AH@@ AH@@ A , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people often turn into drinks @-@ recep@@ tions , film @-@ night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also places where people dress and make their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : do not remember to start with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted get a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ room hum@@ id culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you must go away so that I get the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a comp@@ en@@ ci@@ one of soci@@ alizing is exhausted - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos fluctu@@ ating : do it .
a guy in my residence halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
&quot; as you begin the Uni at the height of the Back Man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck on the doors of people to imagine with a plate of Brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I have baked you something . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering tasty treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; poor@@ ly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to making people dor@@ man@@ t when you drop . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the hoo@@ king of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even when they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; when someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my ro@@ ommate , who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
it is now in prison .
you should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense , you belong to the people who are sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , if it makes a difference to them , Drum and bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they acted on it with even lou@@ der music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be too much embarrass@@ ing if you &apos;re holding a ro@@ ommate for your future spouse , take care of them , get rid of them and see them every day , and perhaps experience how they bring together all common friends . &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future spouse , try to speak a little sense to your conversation . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his not locked room , the border between an Ul@@ k and har@@ ass@@ ment f@@ one as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good monkey is funny , but it only takes moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security , but don &apos;t miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot;
&quot; close your door and put your keys into a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but do not t@@ ack its poss@@ essions on the ceiling any more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terrac@@ ed houses for refugees , secluded , low @-@ income &quot;
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds in the middle @-@ Francon@@ ian corner terrac@@ ed houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; thus , for example , for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the mother and the least deser@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; I show how to build good and good build today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds up terrac@@ ed houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will be pushing for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass storage in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay in a large part here .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we also need sufficient living space over the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution . &quot;
guil@@ d : a terrac@@ ed house needs the least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if one under@@ takes people in residential blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be converted easily according to the specific needs .
what are the costs ?
&quot; guil@@ ders : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .

&quot; Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true that we had a boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living room . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the recruitment app , tap on &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling that the &quot; software update fails . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to handle the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush is back or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has done it more impro@@ b@@ able by simpli@@ fying the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do so when using a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install it as soon as the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may switch to half way and this could lead to a break @-@ down of the update . &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s sole motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only a motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula One against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the decisive seven overseas races , the World Cup Zwei@@ te emphas@@ ised that I have nothing more to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion in Singapore on this Sunday from defending champion and two @-@ fold champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the twelve season races so far and takes the Fl@@ ut@@ licht Grand @-@ Prix in the city @-@ state as a favorite .
&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Br@@ ite was able to win the race . &quot;
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have an influence on the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; founded three months ago has added another member in its ranks so the number of members increased to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul Gau@@ sel@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who took more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to the spa . &quot;
Gau@@ sel@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
&quot; the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported Gau@@ sel@@ mann with a donation , the chairman Alfred Klein met . &quot;
&quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search should also be promoted .
&quot; Gau@@ sel@@ mann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; Red @-@ Weiß &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of his connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town . &quot;
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro searches for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the retirement centre Anton@@ ho@@ ft have joined forces under the clo@@ ak of the social foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
&quot; in addition to consulting , one can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation runs down from the mountain into the city center .
more precisely to the Graf St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
there was recently opened a new district office .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice seek@@ ers receive information on questions such as care insurance or services of health care insurance companies . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been committed to our out@@ patient care service that often nour@@ ishing relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; the new bud@@ get@@ ary Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ eli@@ ft and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; Amadeus &quot; , &quot; will not rarely be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment . &quot;
the offers of the retirement centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis ideally complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis is responsible for prevention , precau@@ tion and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; described Heike R@@ ie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
because it makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future imperative .
&quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration ceremony , the district office dedic@@ ates himself to the agreement at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able contribution . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the social foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment as possible . &quot;
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

men are beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses seek the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ ome : on Friday evening , around 11.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one out of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man and hit the face with his fist .
the victim suffered from the nose and ble@@ ed strongly out of the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ sted and appe@@ aled to the r@@ ack@@ ets , he first left his victim . &quot;
the injured young man was now brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their home and demonstrated several times there .
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was once again attacked by the m@@ allet and another male .
&quot; under the help of a stroke , one checked on the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
&quot; until now , only a v@@ ague tat@@ too is found . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second r@@ ack@@ et should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
&quot; Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ chen and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , Germany . &quot;
&quot; member of the board of directors Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also delighted . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf are lacking luck : there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; during the retirement of Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at half a point in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; after a re@@ building phase , Müller opened the practice on October 12 , until then he invested 3@@ 10000 Euros to the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the rim exhibition came to meet Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ ain@@ en , who currently completed their professional training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to go into practice in the year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the tr@@ ash would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was ready , I just called them . &quot;
the couple Müller pleased the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss . &quot;
&quot; and so one was agreed , the garbage cans bought the house with the practice . &quot;
&quot; however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there the tw@@ o@@ fold family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several physician offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Chief Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is engaged in volunteers in the DR@@ K @-@ prepar@@ edness @-@ willingness @-@ discipline @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ett@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) has specialized in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the tr@@ ash , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as home@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ thol@@ om@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; after the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EK@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant of a total of 50,000 euros will receive the garbage in the framework of a subsi@@ dy programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; emphas@@ ises Sam@@ son &apos;s mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ ate , about 2000 patients come into practice in the field of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen each quarter , in the north @-@ German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another house doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if there was no successor , it would have gone . &quot;
&quot; by the way , who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hour , also looks at familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; with their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the physicians have practiced for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel says , &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel says . &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly can be felt after the long time already .
&quot; but we continue to dwell in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
her husband is smiling : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed myself in front of gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and would like to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also on our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to submit a asylum application can do so &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue to travel in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; quite like this , the Minister of the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , did not see this in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian does not want to seal its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; each EU member must complete its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function &quot; , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to arrive in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could attack them in the near ma@@ ize fields .
&quot; according to local media , since then in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles are constantly meeting with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it acts mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with about 4,000 refugees , said Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were transferred to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was to suggest people to suggest certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d in the morning , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants had been on the road all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border from Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could actually come to a somewhat far@@ ther west . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; extensive control options &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible withdrawal situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not mention details , but pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; extensive options for border control . &quot; &quot;
follow strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country since then , regarding the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on Serbian side , there are still some 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to remain completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic was trying to calm Wednesday early on a local appearance in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on the alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not currently deal with very high refugee numbers .
&quot; one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
volunteers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distributing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the border of Croatia still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
stock exchanges h@@ ackers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who are accused of having gained insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
insi@@ der shops on the financial markets have been made with the exploited information .
&quot; in this way , the investig@@ ators have reported a total of more than 100 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C release . &quot;
the proceedings against 32 further accused in the case lasted .
most of the defend@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
&quot; around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz , there is a lively operation . &quot;
&quot; people do their ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sions , partly quick steps , sometimes comfortably bum@@ bling . &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep in mind .
&quot; puls@@ ating , pr@@ ying life with wonderful autumn sun and in the middle four large tables with the heading &quot; Before I die I want to .... &quot; &quot;
&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is quite often confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice remedy is available to the pass@@ ers as well as questions and talks about the volunteers .
&quot; while a pass@@ ant spontane@@ ously takes up the chal@@ k and the proposition to &quot; &quot; affir@@ m my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; can be read with the camper through the USA &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stopping the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not long suffer &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again on the br@@ ink of small discussions on the action itself , about life , dealing with death . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only if I realize that for me some@@ time the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly &quot; , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ac@@ onal work Mannheim , which is co @-@ operative with the Car@@ it@@ ase association of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ olds is good . &quot;
&quot; the fact that not everyone wants to disclose themselves publicly to the tables , however , is understandable , finally , it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the issue of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years has contributed much to the fact that people open themselves . &quot;
an assessment shared by Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and mour@@ ning companion belongs to the volunteers of the first hour .
&quot; confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ Assi@@ stance was seeking by Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er , she was immediately reported and was involved in the establishment in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and hosp@@ ice Sankt Vincent . &quot;
they are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid works well with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another wait , keep it precious and treasure the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice service is free and con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations of relatives and associations enables training as well as training and super@@ visions of the death and mour@@ ning companions .
training for new employees will be offered every two years .
&quot; the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; also there , further personal wishes can be recorded on post@@ cards . &quot;

&quot; plans for holiday employment were announced a day later as the ri@@ val U@@ PS that plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , for example the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , ended on August 31 , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research Analy@@ st . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
six of Z@@ acks asked Anal@@ ysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
&quot; in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping that made sales in its unit express delivery to stagn@@ ation . &quot;

&quot; in the last quarter sales of bo@@ d@@ cargo transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher revenue based on higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher labor costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; market trading , about an hour prior to the opening , the Fed@@ Ex stocks fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; on their most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; dro@@ pping over them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seating area is a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mission from Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it is solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are seeing , &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which insur@@ es the financial market itself . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , have predicted a stake of interest this week . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets await the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance for an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Dow Jones Industrial average value was 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , she would have to go very far in her statement to re@@ assure the financial markets so she won &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the set would be expected . &quot;
&quot; although the job creation slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation continued to decline under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month , after China had vali@@ dated its currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would boost global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , with the Dow falls by almost 10 % below the May of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when one should raise interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US central bank . &quot;
now he pre@@ di@@ cts that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is neither the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be considered technically in decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Fund has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
&quot; the mere indication of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; their monetary expansion , solved confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also discuss with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for the asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; chi@@ pper , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which uses interest for interest , commented on decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to decrease their interest rates by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions , despite limited apparent effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives were revers@@ ing these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the quar@@ rel@@ im@@ al 2008 in the first place , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence is not near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a stake in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe that it should be ahead of time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : shelter for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
&quot; to give you a warm welcome , is not without the commitment of countless volunteers . &quot;
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 L@@ enzen .
&quot; every Thursday , she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ er home at Dill@@ inger Straße . &quot;
&quot; she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of the other lessons are at the right school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pap@@ acy company Rio Grande encourages healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization Spr@@ S tries to inform women about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who are painted on breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy food .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that inf@@ ants all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by approximately 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher intake of calories is not the only dietary intervention that mothers should undertake . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new gymn@@ asi@@ um of Bern@@ rie@@ der
the municipal council of Bern@@ ried approved the construction proposal for the 2.3 million euros of expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited plant @-@ building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ arena is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council meeting , the revised construction proposal was unanim@@ ously approved unanim@@ ously without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , the Panel had decided to submit an application for a legal &quot; exception &quot; and &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ centered first and roof over@@ hang &quot; should be built . &quot;
&quot; in the background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; , &quot; the roof incl@@ ine , which is prescribed for energetic reasons - is different to stipul@@ ated in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan had no &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; with regard to the roof incl@@ ination - with the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council generally more restri@@ ctive in the case of eman@@ cipation . &quot;
&quot; however , in turn @-@ building construction , however , this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym building at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the expense of costs .
supplements are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes promotion .
&quot; in the next step of the process , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the Regional Council for testing . &quot;
Klinik Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
&quot; the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned , namely 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of staff move from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the District Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , September 23 . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the 50 employees would be working on the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the more existing inner station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed about the plans .
&quot; the change has triggered the dism@@ iss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the lead and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in any case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for p@@ ac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the inner station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years Fischer is expected to join forces with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree on both houses until next year the former hospital of the scar@@ city , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed to Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , if the current renovation was completed at the hospital in Wei@@ l@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who also is the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , outlines the rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the federal union , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum . &quot;
&quot; that I close . &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say there are several considerations . &quot;
currently there are a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity will not come again , &quot; says Fischer about the reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which was received by the employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where Fischer has worked as chief doctor for more than 30 years , I have not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; in recent decades , the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened again and again , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the palms of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
&quot; the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Wuppertal ad@@ mitt@@ edly is the clear favourite , but there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the last season , the Bad@@ ener related to the B@@ HC had a painful defeat and there was a bit of protection there . &quot;
hunting with two viol@@ ins at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were severely injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use as the police told them .
&quot; after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; as precisely as it could come to the accident , it was unclear at first . &quot;
the Krimin@@ al@@ poli@@ zei ( Criminal Inves@@ tigation )
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the body of 16 @-@ year @-@ old aged 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
&quot; in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old said that the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel at Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , which has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police killed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a suspic@@ ious , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested on Tuesday evening , who was indic@@ ted , was indic@@ ted and the investig@@ ators lead to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after they had not come home on the eve after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , Germany . &quot;
&quot; when looking for a young woman , investig@@ ators first found personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ ses were found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the arrested polic@@ eman reported that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the bodies were put into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be led to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the investigation of the near@@ er circumstances of the matter is to bring forward the further investigations . &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking a affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution disputes on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market which is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens for the last affordable housing .
&quot; to meet the demand for affordable housing , 40@@ 0.000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this results in a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished this year . &quot;
&quot; thus 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of her stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an original residence . &quot;
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant om@@ issions in housing policies over the last few years .
&quot; Germany is finding a housing deficit , which is getting bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently there were some 77@@ 0,000 living units in the metropol@@ itan areas , compl@@ ained Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults voluntarily stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the lack of accommodation on the housing market .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the &quot; &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; &quot; alliance is propos@@ ing a new start . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives for housing construction should be revi@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; thus , the land tax exemp@@ tion tax could be wai@@ ved and the properties for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats are suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation options are necessary according to the Alliance . &quot;
the support programme for the Kf@@ W refugee information is already well received in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , with 184 million euros on Monday evening , more than half of the available EUR 300 million had been retri@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be raised . &quot;
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; there is practically no transit to Hungary anymore , as more and more refugees are choosing the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces that we pass through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
&quot; however , the route is still dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia via the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Interior Minister , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; following the sealing off the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have been abandoned to Croatia in order to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV channel RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , are also practically superf@@ lu@@ ous in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic declared : &quot; &quot; you can travel through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country . &quot;
&quot; most tribal media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian Border stadt Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not run on border fence . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border strip contains other dangers : there are even more sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , however , there are hardly any more refugees after the closure of the border . &quot;
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 people arrested .
&quot; shortly before the closing ceremony on Monday , it had been 93@@ 80 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws will classi@@ fy the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
the convic@@ ted threat of imprisonment up to five years and the deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; Tran@@ sit @-@ ons &quot; of 94 , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
13 families with small children and two elderly people are among the applicants .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees staying there . &quot;
&quot; however , no one has a prospect of receiving asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe country . &quot; &quot;
the ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers should be deport@@ ed there .
only a few hundred refugees assembled in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up . &quot;
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side during the past few weeks .
barrier nets were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the bor@@ der@@ land was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
only a few refugees arrive after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; but the 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government data . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy with the fr@@ aming day after the bridge , when there were suddenly ten people with travel car@@ vers at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to take the train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , however , because of the flow of refugees with Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ atted the frames along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to Nah@@ e Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we have neglected the un@@ hoped guests only once , with snack and drinks . &quot;
we have just said that we bring them to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to a regional train in Wels by ICE in a regional train in the direction of Pass@@ au on Sunday evening , so that after the short notice the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still to try crossing the border . &quot;
the regional train was set off before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing generally is high in the course .
&quot; the bridge @-@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday soci@@ ably , on the other day a bridge running sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án can now send further tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the construction of structures to ensure humanity , our ch@@ anc@@ ellor has officially recognized the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ stan of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; promised land , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge faced by the ongoing flow of refugees and the close winter , to establish decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even bigger one - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad , looking for 3@@ 5,000 Winter @-@ solid Quar@@ ters &quot;
&quot; with the spreading of refugees , Konrad has all hands full to do . &quot;
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen @-@ bank@@ ers to place lod@@ gings for thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos in the first recording centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees , which came to Austria on Monday , was without major ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ catching situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ igen year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 units must be found in the next weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 the federal government . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the state cent@@ ur@@ ions .
&quot; they would have assured him , also to create lod@@ gings for the coming refugees . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping how we are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform individuals can easily offer accommodation .
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels which are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of notation , it cannot be that qu@@ arti@@ ers have to hold a certain amount of the towel rail or the size of the harmon@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Interior Ministry , that he was successful at the accommodation , Konrad lived with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not charge the Republic as they explained themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
&quot; until now , our own district search has not been successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to put a container on the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for better distribution
&quot; first , there is no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as it is possible to submit to those affected without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of an emergency , other locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
the City Council critic@@ ises the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution .
&quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) ordered further action in the refugee question on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er ass@@ ures me that the German borders are not sealed .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
&quot; however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany by regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once called for greater solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
the fact that Austria now carries out controls on its borders is for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; a logical consequence &quot; of the action of the Germans .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group is pulled in S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology section . &quot;
&quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Wer@@ ft , and later to acquire them . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; at 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which was one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are inquiries . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second store in the arcade
Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are at the centre of the new shop .
&quot; in fact , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to be postpon@@ ed by the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arc@@ ade : after all , she has now gained an increase in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which they sold bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , everything about women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; prior to that , several weeks have been rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have long over@@ laid whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of an own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region Linz who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who has even Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has given Br@@ eit from her mother into the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women on the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the specialist woman cannot answer with the last certainty . &quot;
maybe it is because a nice bag of each outfit is upgraded .
the zero @-@ jes@@ land from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also connects to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
&quot; whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself as a stranger , as far as journalists are concerned or gaps in gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office is power@@ ing the election campaign power@@ fully . &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ alz region of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate @-@ billi@@ on@@ aire are originated . &quot;
the New Yorker with the hair @-@ hair@@ style is a concept for many in the win@@ emaking village on the wine route .
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ site is related over -@@ eigh@@ ty corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode . &quot;
the killer of Simone Wen@@ del directed a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter way , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native killer has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous young@@ sters , among which Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also in word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit of a grand Moor@@ ish , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt was in the circle , &quot; &quot; The Bridge @-@ jes@@ ac &quot; &quot; - in High German : the host , says it . &quot;
&quot; so , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders . &quot;
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate group was first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to home in a long time , failed on the Bavarian State , to which the Pfalz were at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once removed without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a boundary wall to fri@@ ghten illegal immigrants .
&quot; this is not so lik@@ eable , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative g@@ ong ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in retirement , the Win@@ emaker rather dis@@ soci@@ ates the American , &quot; he is always so sincere . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm , as many K@@ all@@ Places , men@@ tions that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine that of Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the say at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ death Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ lob@@ s , also in the USA awak@@ ens the interest . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Bavaria municipality Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages in Austria . &quot;
the local Alpine Association is responsible for awar@@ ding the award in the neighbouring country .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no big shifts at the reviews for Today . &quot;
the N@@ ine breakfast show was aired by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull created the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was stuck in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un . &quot;
&quot; this draw@@ back of the resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five major cities compared to today 33@@ 9,000 . &quot;
&quot; today Today posted a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
&quot; in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 ran . &quot;
&quot; up to now in September , sunrise with an average of 34@@ 9,000 viewers is at 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently swe@@ at@@ y father , who decides to settle in New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics have wondered whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and easily defeated The Block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 p.m. to 5 : 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , showed an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ 000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour , 7@@ 20,000 recorded . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at aver@@ aging 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ ride the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have unknow@@ ingly revealed who The Bachelor takes . &quot;
&quot; the woman , who finally lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was envel@@ op@@ ed in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up if they are the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we check@@ out with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may acci@@ dentally given a hint on who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood covers his lips to the fin@@ als on Thursday
&quot; all three women have left in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last Rose ? &quot; could be their answers to the game spoil , who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
Je@@ anne@@ x Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki knew both quickly - except for themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought it all over the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ ann@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that last week the visit to the house made it clear that Wood can be &quot; the One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly tuned to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked , whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 h . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle demonstrated great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a clever decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a b@@ ail as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Conver@@ t at his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers sports repor@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his bog@@ ged catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first game district of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings &quot;
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine any worse start into his N@@ FL
&quot; that was a thing that seems to happen , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut back then in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old . &quot;

&quot; because of the high refugee numbers , the Free voters are demanding the setting up of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the FW issue in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free voters is conven@@ ed until Friday in the Francon@@ ian Commun@@ e .
&quot; actually , all other main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free choice of voters .
&quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as there were during the war in Yugoslavia during the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free voters . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push the free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the FW boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states nationwide . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria p@@ ushes off , others not . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more able to act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the educational policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Inter@@ medi@@ ate plus &quot; at 47 gymn@@ asts , with an extension of the secondary school of secondary school three to four years . &quot;
but that &apos;s not far enough from Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all high school students who want this .
&quot; free travel at G@@ 9 everywhere , where it is desired . &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber shells on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal , after the police shot rubber shells into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the force broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i District , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , Head of District Auth@@ ors , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , some of them threw stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said , the police have used tear gas and then fired into the air before returning to rubber shells . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber shells used are known to be killed , but they are traditionally used as less deadly alternatives , apparently producing such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ uni@@ ans say that new provinces , formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the Western Nepal of the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent disputes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature has accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be re@@ built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the commerci@@ alization of the 4000 square meter area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , trade and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 m2 plot in direct neighbourhood to the youth center Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; the plan is to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , trade and living . &quot;
&quot; waiting for appropriate offers , it is called by the city . &quot;
what investor question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Street , already a few months ago and can be torn down on it . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday homes at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented publicly plans for the project for the first time .
several tra@@ ilers are further worried - they fear the sale of their leisure flights
&quot; for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday resort at the small sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the interested , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ de company &quot; System construction , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Municipal Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP group , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends proce@@ eded from the system building management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market . key Vend@@ ors
&quot; hef@@ ty reactions among marine owners , who had come to the meeting , highlighted the images and new details of the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea bree@@ der and member of the board of interests of the tra@@ ilers , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a huge kl@@ ot@@ z , which over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; in addition , as many other project critics , he fears that traffic would increase considerably due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; all the bus loads must come so that that is worthwhile &quot; , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what exactly is done on the well one hect@@ are of the former restaurant , is however still open . &quot;
there is no operator .
&quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this still l@@ acked , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google starts dou@@ bling Don@@ ation campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling don@@ ating campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations , which will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ tax@@ ed the European nations as they escape from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark train and bus cru@@ ises , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately seek help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four char@@ itable organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com / refuge@@ er@@ el@@ ief will be doubled to 11 million dollars .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely due to the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many escaped from the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;
coverage by Yas@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; editing by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight diab@@ etics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity @-@ surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a body @-@ mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital recorded data gathered in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric hose formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this operation decreased from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease is completely and at 28 % partial . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and in part with only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the control of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood sugar values over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at approximately 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ c@@ emic control &quot; &quot; - as reflected in improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mort@@ ality in five years , so the leader researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show a survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of heavier men in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who under@@ went obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study has no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for persons with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a subject that is currently being increasingly respected in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her . &quot;
so even in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , as he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ lers and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she could put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot absorb all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged him to stop violence in the refugees &quot; home countries .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford that focuses on ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis could be admired , but the situation was not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to reflect on long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we must reflect on how the kill@@ ings are reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the United States attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after 11 September I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four times increase of han@@ de@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ low heavily alcoholic solv@@ ents , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income from hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , which report poison control centers , rose from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants inten@@ tionally while some do it to impress their friends , or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media . &quot;
show videos on YouTube how young people dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing m@@ outh@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive frag@@ rances of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing for children . &quot;
suspension dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation particularly with small children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison @-@ emergency center at the Hospital of K@@ ans@@ as University , the transmitter Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p of whis@@ ky , but people leave these hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in reach of children , and when children come to it then it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sy@@ ring@@ es of after straw@@ berry sc@@ ented hand san@@ iti@@ zer at school , was brought into an emergency stop . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered to be drunk by an adult by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah touched her words and was unable to go when she arrived at the emergency .
&quot; doctors guar@@ ded them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and came across the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the State of New York had planned to poison their &quot; nasty &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ iti@@ zer and ban@@ ished her from her room .
the police viewed the neglected plan as &quot; Gesch@@ i@@ ät@@ z &quot; and dism@@ issed disciplinary measures against the school authorities .
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; at a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and Her@@ der , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver was slightly injured during a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision . &quot;
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross@@ bar towards round@@ about industrial area and took notice too late that at the round@@ about two driving cars had stopped .
&quot; as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audit with his lor@@ ry and shot this vehicle on a previously standing Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; in the vehicles of accident @-@ related vehicles , property damage was about 10,000 euros , shares the police with . &quot;

Griff@@ i@@ ths plays Ger@@ ede on Dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; there are rum@@ ors about disc@@ ord at Celtic Glasgow , which was spontane@@ ously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team comrades are not under increased control , as they are preparing for confrontation with the Dutch table leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players look forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish So@@ ccer boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former ranking mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the old @-@ case games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn around things around , Dei@@ la swe@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which is now clearly at the top of the table with five points ahead . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; Celtic had already had bad times before and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel this exactly - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need to really support Celtic , because it makes the players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .

&quot; the ex boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
&quot; the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate , what you have seen with our own group during this season . &quot;
the team is really good .
&quot; sometimes , more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need . &quot;

&quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; there is no team who has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , which games of this type have not won . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is increasing . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period May to July while the number of people without labour for the United Kingdom increased from 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was about 5.5 percent of the UK@@ s , as the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of workers now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I will be witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p exec@@ utes through the poison@@ ous sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day was near@@ er , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and since more applications are available as seats , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; who is chosen , who will watch it emotion@@ less . &quot;
I cannot .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access . &quot;
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; she admitted that she could &quot; have formulated it better , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s false what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of Pod@@ casts that I made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to mention all the details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary .
but I believe that a strong probability exists that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can contact .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after hum@@ id police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he was talking to the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
&quot; trying a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was sum@@ mon@@ ed into Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ have@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
master @-@ soccer player Ben c@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to escape from alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspiring natives to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben c@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
&quot; Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year , threatening to end the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he aimed at ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity department , claiming that she performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do that which is best for racing and he has found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cob@@ alt @-@ test specimen at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age alleg@@ ations , and didn &apos;t want it to look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve been sitting on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out suddenly , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to move about from the head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
then I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously Moo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months Terr@@ y Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.@@ com. &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to grasp . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , the current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should that bring me to the point that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have cow@@ ard@@ ly restra@@ ined and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and drive me away , and I have no doubt that what I say they can think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care about , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the trainers of the Train@@ ers have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching caused him to &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation for the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race tags treatment rule &quot; &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the equ@@ est@@ rian cre@@ pe , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of my collabor@@ ators has mistakenly applied mud to the leg . &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day that was like that .
but it was also the same on the day of the race .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack at the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here it &apos;s gone too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested after driver &apos;s flight
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man following a coll@@ ision with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with a helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from Nath@@ alia was the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
&quot; he is expected to be indic@@ ted for driver &apos;s cur@@ sed and deser@@ ted assistance , and for other means of transport . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats ri@@ vals because of claims to ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as an &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
&quot; Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm @-@ Player &quot; &quot; Ring fights &quot; &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot;
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed note to the Storm Team , after his crew scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the rug@@ by league and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land are not too good . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the tor@@ ch of his team and said that they only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; at tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team was confident about him , as it was that they were worried that they were worried to be hit by the Storm @-@ Team . &quot;
&quot; this always appears again - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson said about the ring fights when they struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focal point , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit a shock to him . &quot;
&quot; it is strange , as it appears again and again at this time of the year . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons has won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this . &quot;
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they did not think of us when it was about the big games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters was a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and no points a bit tension@@ ing ?
for me it is the play@@ lists .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that at one stage we will meet them . &quot;
&quot; the storm team released this weekend , as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks during the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin from next Tuesday morning . &quot;
&quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ans with 200,000 $ Dep@@ o@@ sit on Drug Policy &quot;
&quot; a man who could possibly serve a life @-@ long sentence due to his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , who were sm@@ ug@@ gled up to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life @-@ long sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café there might have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security to reach his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ it statements of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on security deposit , under the conditions that he left off his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and sat down at a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s house tears apart
&quot; at a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver has been severely injured on Tuesday night . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
the third rider noticed it too late and tried in vain to devi@@ ate at the last moment to the left as the police reported .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ caused mower is completely apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage amoun@@ ting to 12@@ 2,000 Euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ oph@@ ile to send images
a ped@@ oph@@ ile used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl when he was asleep , logged in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through and found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , analysed then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; relevant &quot; &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for un@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then said to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile in the Internet &quot; and he &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction - that he was addic@@ ted to fri@@ ghten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the search was carried out on the computer from him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ oph@@ ils . &quot;
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce them .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused &apos;s computer and Play@@ station used to talk with girls who looked much younger than him .
&quot; on 25 January this year , H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to having viol@@ ated un@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June this year and did not appear before the court hearing on 24 March of this year . &quot;
&quot; the defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the registry of sexual off@@ ences , as one could argue that &quot; &quot; there is no considerable sexual element &quot; &quot; in his transgres@@ sion . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael f@@ ades the verdict until October to get background reports about social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted a deposit in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was added before the date of the judgment to the directory of sexual off@@ ences .
slu@@ ices switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the big control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks left people from fear of discovery and arrest the people on smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the border river Inn in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and con@@ ges@@ tion to the German side .
&quot; there , they are received by the Federal Police and passed on to the registration . &quot;
&quot; Wednesday , 18.@@ February@@ 2016 You are not logged in ... &#91; Log In &#93; &quot;
&quot; about 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 am , a spokes@@ man said in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday . &quot;
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of Trop@@ ical Storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest expected
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm o@@ aks in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; because of a low pressure area over Western Europe currently warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) distributed in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low is the head of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic over the past few days . &quot;
violent storms and storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , until Thursday early also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom @-@ sea rice with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 hours of kilometers . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the car makers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , it is mainly a movement among the compact cars that are currently particularly well selling . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : around 28,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment alone in August , according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office ( Bundes@@ amt ) . &quot;
this is reflected in the IA@@ A ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be presented between all of the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; the Opel Astra is one of the largest premier@@ es for the German automotive industry , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in prospect , starting at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra co@@ operates from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ litre engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the major competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only one fifth . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the combination , which is already visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IA@@ A even on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively to be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a high@@ lighting sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade , he arrives at the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bo . &quot;
infin@@ ity : new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan tra@@ der wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti is fully integrated into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n laun@@ cher placed hand on the front part : here the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated the first Apple Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; at the IA@@ A in the compact class , they join a series of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the refurbished Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court issued a former prisoner of the Court of Justice of the Court of Justice , which was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners generally claim financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this decision adopted by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
&quot; the persons affected may even hope for money , if only a few days were locked in confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) . &quot;
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally non @-@ separated .
&quot; after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , has now res@@ igned on the free foot , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his term of office because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Berlin Court of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for re @-@ examination . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of bon@@ ding for compensation are author@@ itative , a compensation claim is given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a wor@@ sen@@ ing of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of the compensation .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; thus , only in April , they spoke to an in@@ mate of in@@ dem@@ nity , because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision of 2011 , un@@ worthy is the multiple occupation of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in addition to Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
the former plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in recent weeks , Berlin &apos;s pris@@ ons have also come to the head@@ lines for lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to r@@ ack@@ ets should already be due to the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information provided by the Justice Press Office 21 points in Te@@ gel are not occupied for lack of offspring , 19 to 2016 will be removed . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to Deputy Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Deputy Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany will be able to take up one million refugees . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated commitment in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we can do it . &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to different forecasts between 35@@ 0000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Interior ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as is currently being built ( 25@@ 0000 Apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but especially with affordable rental properties : every year , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing from the rental cost is out , and these particularly affordable housing will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros . &quot;
&quot; a lot too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing annually would have to be created , and the federal government would have to invest a total of 6.4 billion euros a year . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , scientists and Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but the integration of refugees is crucial if they find employment in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political turning point : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognition of labour . &quot;
&quot; while there was formerly a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the residen@@ cy light , the asylum seek@@ ers are limited to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , also because of the shortage of skilled workers , the visibility prev@@ ails , that refugees should be enabled to access the labour market faster . &quot;
lack of German knowledge is a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
up to now there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
&quot; according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the construction of networks is the king &apos;s path to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Management has noticed that only a few nur@@ tured parents give their children to kit@@ sch , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ uted parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ bills in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators increased greatly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more specialised schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without German knowledge are prepared for classes without German knowledge . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ einer from the Berlin School Management . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception has hitherto been Berlin , Interior sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has given up his stance . &quot;
student @-@ willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated to access the university .
&quot; for refugees with a residence permit or de@@ ple@@ tion do not receive services according to the asylum seek@@ er law more , when they start studying . &quot;
&quot; in general , the latter do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ ering people . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 onwards , this Spanish will be reduced to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely grant to Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ church law to develop a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important to establish a Islamic welfare organization , who cares for the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will also have to change , the disman@@ tling of discrimination and racism is more urgent . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency for a decade and a general equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it is very slow how the NS@@ U @-@ murder @-@ series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignor@@ ing the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrant workers and stakeholders are demanding for a long time and why international agreements , such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ist convention in Germany , must become reality in the next few years , if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to medi@@ cally supply the expected refugees , says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacity , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must be incorporated into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery ur@@ ges to susp@@ end all incoming ke@@ epers at the registration of health cards . &quot;
performances could later be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to leave so many people with the limited power catalogue , which envis@@ ages the asylum seek@@ er law . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , doctors first of all do the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proved that migrants are worse informed of their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would require interpretation costs . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees have already been helped by more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; among refugee children , there are much more physical disabilities , and the young people are dealing with HIV . &quot;
&quot; with some other diseases , German doctors come from their education but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; and as for the doctor &apos;s case , the refugees may even have a relief in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly dism@@ iss testing again . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder , among other things , suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with difficulty breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rage and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleeping and concentration disorders , strong trem@@ bling and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent symptoms from chronic illness , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; while psych@@ ically sick asylum seek@@ ers can submit an application for psych@@ otherapy in the welfare offices , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the Social Off@@ ices of mostly non @-@ workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to attract every age group into the captiv@@ ating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst downloads in the Man@@ ege on the brick to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ chef . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the actual man@@ hole staging . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
the gift to the Inspir@@ ers is thus the family in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to pick the people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year old Juni@@ or@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ enco@@ ck@@ tails with world city flair , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
&quot; excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ot C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with w@@ it and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of silent films it wants to take up the Cuban duo loos@@ ely .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art on the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and artic@@ ulation . &quot;

snake people fascinated and fri@@ ghtened at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with its mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ ises Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gaps in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a stand : &quot; it is not good for our animals .
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged &quot; &quot; arti@@ ste , as they are called lovingly , is read by the eyes of every desire . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena . &quot;
the top commandment is therefore good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , was our little jum@@ bo there , &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 people , we always give our best and are with our whole heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst runs every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m .
on Sunday the programme starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are discounted . &quot;
it is also open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media . &quot;
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to join Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
&quot; last month , they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
spokes@@ person for Democratic Change Movement ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions politi@@ cian received SMS messages on their phones which warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity in Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the spokes@@ man said that the party led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned about the dangers for politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30.000 work@@ stations
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job loss leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett Packard business , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and expanded portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual sales and &quot; will be focused on delivering so far @-@ reaching , integrated technology solutions for companies &quot; such as an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , to manufacture electro @-@ systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage as &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot; &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to handle the conversion from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies perform better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and , as long as his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer will be certainly still uncertain . &quot;
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger acknowledged , there is the associated danger of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd. reports 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere diseases since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most injuries . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the likel@@ ihood of injuries will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury you have a decent time period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and gain battle strength , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the type he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to give a little break @-@ off , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al are clear favour@@ ites to move on by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched last season .
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , being measured on the Richter scale 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains driven by far hope to lead the association to his first European apo@@ calyp@@ tic triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked out at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Campaign against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced in 2015 than the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ re@@ piece in battle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call extr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the Schön@@ e with Friends was that this focus was put on his head .
&quot; every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments during football coaching in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even if they often hold back to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; like an employee of the phone pastoral care , I explained : &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and end@@ angers , has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
&quot; the old phrase &quot; I come along with it &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone might help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the fully re@@ designed setting for the celebration of the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , Maria di Maria meets PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö at the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadi@@ on on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball@@ tor at the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris requires a strong start against the Swedish master , as it is not only the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents trouble and look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the season , &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not achieve one or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 decision on the weekend against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was referred to as the man who took PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he was running in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , before he finished in the long corner of the network in Johan Wil@@ and . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , appeared at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was lined up with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the middle ground , a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ apps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scrat@@ ched in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ bo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , turning the Di Maria into a shot , which was led by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ... &quot;
the second goal finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth seasonal door after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before substitute player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification matches are not enough . &quot;
hats off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore collects $ 2.5 billion through shares
&quot; the Mining Ri@@ ese Gl@@ enc@@ ore , which is based in Switzerland , is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , accumulated $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday as part of its huge debt recovery plan . &quot;
&quot; the company Gl@@ enc@@ ore , registered in London , said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion £ to pay its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which lost 57 percent of its market value this year , fights with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses demand and is devast@@ ated by markets . &quot;
the issue of subscription rights posted a rapid rise in the top of the London Stock Exchange when trading in the early Wednesday morning .
&quot; the share jump@@ ed by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ enc@@ ore announced last week the $ 2.5 billion share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around a third of its $ 30 billion debt , announced . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9,@@ 99 percent of the group . &quot;

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ p@@ ings visit in Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , will take place on 25 September and re@@ vo@@ iced President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
the US president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a state dinner after the two leaders have bilateral talks .
&quot; President xis visit will offer the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a series of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi will be able to construc@@ tively approach areas of dis@@ agreements . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , will probably meet several US technology leaders on its way to Washington before going to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi will address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber @-@ sp@@ ying of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi was playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; a few years ago FC Bayern was just before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who was playing for FC Barcelona at that time . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times kno@@ ck@@ out champion , four times Champions League winner , two times champion world champion , twice champion , one time champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi reveals that he was standing in Barcelona before the European Championship 2008 . &quot;
they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won anything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and this also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann acquired FC Bayern . &quot;
guar@@ ola was the reason X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this works today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I have played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .
&quot; that he has gotten me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns Spiel@@ zeit 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , switched off the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s victory at the end . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the af@@ ro@@ American filmm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a succession of Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ Light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted , when he emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives , in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , do it with the cast of the film and not at the cast of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown shocked , with off@@ ended un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comment@@ aries of the actor by The Mar@@ tian gar@@ ner@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined forces Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers , to discuss the show fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and it is a mare that is beaten by her white plu@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said , &quot; At the end we could give something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was aired , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni kno@@ cked his anger over the clip by saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Matter Group achieved country @-@ wide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to enjo@@ in discri@@ min@@ atory practices against paints . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a recording on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still matter , ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in more recent times , leaders of movement Black Li@@ ves Matter published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Matter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crowned first champion
&quot; professional sports climbing and manual Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete , who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which had just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last task , climbing is one 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time , with which he was the first ath@@ lete , who completed the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prize of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than 10,000 $ , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the fastest time , &quot; We@@ ed said . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he has a gru@@ dge over it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think Isaac would have felt the same , if they had changed the roles . &quot;
&quot; America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior was extended for an icy relay season , the filming will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks by Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
the second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are standing in the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday . &quot;
the T@@ wins w@@ asted a chance to climb inside a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Kis@@ m . &quot;
&quot; tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in the 1 / 3 in@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw at each game in the bull@@ pen , and therefore I want to go into the game entirely . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first round since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he sw@@ ung the drum well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( kick training ) , looked much better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh inning the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cian to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy ran down the wall , the only man facing him , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right @-@ handed la@@ w Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the final run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor to a Double Play . &quot;
&quot; it was the 27th time in this season , that pl@@ ou@@ ffe stroke a double play &quot;
&quot; after det@@ ecting a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inning , the Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed stom@@ ach@@ s stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ ava . &quot;
Detroit became the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game of an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inner ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been removed from the game of the injury list after he had been missing for more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , H@@ flus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman &apos;s Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runner in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed a single on the right , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
the tig@@ ers placed in the second one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not beat well , but he caught the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch Count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ic rec@@ ess A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es we came to three racks with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ ke@@ - outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to injury of the throwing shoulder .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the S@@ earch@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the injury list because of a shoulder rig , is supposed to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is removed from the injury list to start the T@@ wins . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30th &quot;
he has been ste@@ aling on the right hip joint since the 20th of August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot;
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ essi@@ an capital were prepared for this case in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily shelter there .
they should then be spread to other municipalities .
&quot; over the past ten days alone , the government pres@@ idency of the government of G@@ ießen took 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse . &quot;
&quot; due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls . &quot;
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think the decisive thinking about military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he accused the European states &quot; collective action . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , we were glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military stake in Germany . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschland@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive extension of international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , after Hungary no one is sent back . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , too , no refugees returned to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
they did not call them concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary . &quot;
your goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann made a special summit for the next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not been able to agree on joint action in the crisis so far . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to binding distribution of more 120,000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first @-@ hand and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel in the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , are doing this as well . &quot;
&quot; but if you don &apos;t have a perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany . &quot;
this view had been dealt with firmly in the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary had closed its 175 km long border to Serbia during the night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to seal the border with Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of migrants reported in Turkey on their way to the Greek border . &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; below the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Saturn @-@ monds , En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean swe@@ eps . &quot;
&quot; this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the moon dan@@ gling easily on its way around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; this exchange rate is only small , but still too big for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses on the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
&quot; even longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice @-@ ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in 2006 Cass@@ ini had already discovered Eis@@ vul@@ can@@ on at the southern pole of the Saturn Moon , sp@@ inning water vap@@ or and ice particles , thereby feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden oceans was not clari@@ fied . &quot;
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München has to do without Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old gave an examination to the association .
&quot; at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama compl@@ ained about pain . &quot;
&quot; according to Munich &apos;s Lion , the diagnosis is expected to mean four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; this makes us hard , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we need to think now , &quot; &quot; said Sport Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a united pro@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive weapon . &quot;
&quot; the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active in Belgium , and was under contract for V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg earlier . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the Cro@@ ats have the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot;
&quot; after his conc@@ ussion , the Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training again next week . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian National player is supposed to start running . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had hurt in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) with a sharp coll@@ ision at the head .
&quot; however , contrary to the first concerns , he remained without a serious cens@@ orship . &quot;
no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slim line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ gan@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. How@@ ever , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
man@@ gan@@ ese should not be too soft or too firm and sm@@ elling pleasantly .
&quot; the peel colour alone says nothing about the ripe fruit , so green man@@ goes can taste very tasty . &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
but a man@@ go adds a special touch to sav@@ ory dishes .
it moder@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

&quot; for the Christmas business in the US , the US parcel service U@@ PS will once again provide up to 95@@ 000 foreigners . &quot;
&quot; the company started with the recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS shared on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; above all , drivers are being sought . &quot;
&quot; last year , U@@ PS extended its workforce for the holiday season by 95@@ 0,000 support . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competi@@ tor Fed@@ Ex have previously made arrangements for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel service . &quot;
&quot; first F@@ öh@@ n@@ sturm , then distinctive cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps side of the F@@ öh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland split on Tuesday . &quot;
on Wednesday and on the night on Thursday the F@@ öh@@ n blows with storm strength through the F@@ öh@@ n@@ tal valleys .
&quot; after f@@ öh@@ n@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a marked cold front , which brings strong rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland currently stands on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current . &quot;
&quot; on the north side of the Alps , the caves break through the valleys in the night . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n blows up until Thursday morning in the F@@ öh@@ n@@ valleys with gu@@ sts from 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally and partly in the Ur@@ i land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öh@@ n can advance in places to the ad@@ joining Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even or@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ ehn ensures summer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees Celsius , the moisture of the mountain slope begins to ch@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; here , rain sets a rain that lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in total , South of the Alps must be expected in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter , this has already fallen in the last few days already big amounts of rain . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the f@@ öh@@ n opens the air , in the episode a cold front rolls with a strong , partially swe@@ ating rain from west to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front the wind e@@ ats up strongly to stor@@ my , and temperatures are falling significantly . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the other hand , on the weekend it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
&quot; just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of City President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now acknowledged as a &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Protestant Churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live in disgu@@ ise for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; with the square , it is symbo@@ lically visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he felt the city as a sin@@ ess sin@@ ner @-@ b@@ able . &quot;
his negative impressions are likely to have reinforced him according to historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare H@@ og@@ an Lov@@ ells
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; Jesus with the &quot; &quot; golden crown &quot; &quot; is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with magnificent pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 different motifs . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he met a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles have ar@@ isen which focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; with this , he spontane@@ ously fascin@@ ates several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the Scrip@@ tures on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Scrip@@ tures selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus translated into contemporary contexts into contemporary contexts . &quot;
these texts are as verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original text of Martin Luther &apos;s original text and a set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts about the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; in this way , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old enjoys twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately tri@@ ggers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant sovereign Order . &quot;
&quot; the education already happened with the cane stock , &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work that , in order to possibly also bear me with the Lord &apos;s father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to give art more importance in the quick@@ est time : &quot; today &apos;s perception of visual worlds is marked by advertising , and it is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewers to &quot; &quot; fall into the pictures &quot; &quot; to let them work , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; &quot; the image is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday when presenting the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; &quot; always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not care not to capture the Bible completely , but were selected for him important , also mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas - is presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15 at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;

&quot; failures in politics and administration caused land@@ lords , especially among the residents who did not want to toler@@ ate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill slo@@ ping , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be made in October , the first joint municipality Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to inform in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; with the work in the former indoor pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees from 2019 to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear mark on the weekend . &quot;
football is responding to the intensi@@ fying situation in Germany and ass@@ ures policy its help in tac@@ kling the upcoming problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that &apos;s not about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be of interest to each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will intensively discuss the situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State , Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football can and will help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be put into politics .
the German Football Association therefore has expanded its refugee initiatives &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to four years .
&quot; we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Nier@@ sbach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
&quot; already this weekend , the 36 professional associations put a clear sign when they will be wearing the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; said L@@ ever@@ k@@ ens Sport@@ manager Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes every way , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football allies , no , we have to use our jet power , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim CEO Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
&quot; on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; Nier@@ sbach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that all 36 license clubs in their locations would have started their own projects , be great . &quot;
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B and the Federal Government , will provide € 300,000 for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; explained Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ Board of Directors lo@@ oses an eye in accident
&quot; the board leader of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident at the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell on a glass of water after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ ed , f@@ ain@@ ted , and then drag@@ ged out onto the road - he told us so last week , &quot; said the &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully work@@ able . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , which will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP da , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually oscill@@ ates between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to get to the public with such a personal story , &quot; said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can pass something like that . &quot;
&quot; it is important to get up again , if one has fallen . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ mish ...
&quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a photograph and explained , he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot;
&quot; in Singapore on the weekend , he was just as little as a reserv@@ ist for the two Stam@@ bo@@ il@@ ots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us vs. Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europa League have finally broken . &quot;
the national player will also be missing in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel for L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its stem eleven at the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change at the door@@ ke@@ epers position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of stem cell Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all the Europa League games in the future , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also ride the second game . &quot;

robot cars : government wants a pioneering role for Germany
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; Wednesday , 18.@@ February@@ 2016 You are not logged in ... &#91; Log In &#93; &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke of a &quot; new mobility era . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the issue with his counterpart in the G@@ 7 countries , which will meet with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategy paper emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and quick access to digital radio . &quot;
currently there is a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria for testing new technology .
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; avoid any additional liability risks &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany is aiming at an international level that the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only seen the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören per@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a survey of the digital network of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; at least 15 percent could be seen on the highway in flowing traffic , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car to control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis table
&quot; according to the current situation in the title fight between September 25th and October 4th , the Düsseldorf fair@@ grounds will only be in singles . &quot;
the final decision will be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; said Bundestag trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf , during the EM @-@ Course in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor in China . &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; declared Individu@@ al Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ liste in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo was missing , and we are European leaders . &quot;
&quot; in this we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; explained the world rank@@ ings fifth . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figures set : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on his work .
&quot; highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections . &quot;
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; today , I can no longer say that I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18th at Kunsth@@ alle the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initial attitude towards a show of his person . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; For me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you get to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been done in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly any work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; the show is not chron@@ ologically structured , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograp@@ hed total artwork for which much effort was done : in order to refres@@ h the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated . &quot;
14 tons of material have brought the makers to Munich according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather watch outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers alter ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , tender , fashionable walk @-@ on attempts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he dressed up his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the throwing of fashion himself .
&quot; he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich told . &quot;
later I bought it naturally .
for his first own fashion show he could not pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of sheer curtain - Pl@@ au@@ ener lace as a fashion niche
earlier we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters .
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were produced in a large quantity for customers , which they processed for example for ceilings and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work today anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Pl@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener lace fashion , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lin@@ dustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories like bags and in regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called Vintage Mode , which leans on past styles , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
who does not serve any ni@@ ches in the textile branch in Germany is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they have already taken half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , Mo@@ gran@@ itze Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .

our products do not reach the customer on this path .
&quot; nowadays , mass @-@ ware is much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains . &quot;
&quot; it also weak@@ ens exports , currently to Russia and the US . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score through environmental awareness , as Cord@@ ula Bauer explains by the sti@@ cker in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially responsible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger outdoor table of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - speci@@ alizing in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
&quot; to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design often only slightly varies to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , the textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ bu@@ ked the historic snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine sticks to some places small ch@@ icks . &quot;
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ meister@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; before that , I could not start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate method it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ® young and old , &quot; Re@@ uter says . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and Sur@@ ro@@ undings and would like to be a souvenir . &quot;
&quot; with this , I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;

&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it &apos;s not about a new movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first movie with the magical children &apos;s girl . &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the global economic crisis in England .

XI p@@ ushes to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy must open up wider towards the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group charged with the reform of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote new spin @-@ off@@ s and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality , and offer new space for economic growth , said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of the state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the resident system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art business environment and open the market more open , says the statement . &quot;
the government will also l@@ ure control over the powers transferred to the company and make sure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investments . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy vis @-@ à @-@ vis foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;

EU wants to double mer@@ cury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to reduce the consumption of a clearly higher dose of nerve gifts .
&quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which holds a corresponding working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mer@@ cury , that approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches cannot be sold on the basis of the still valid limit values . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be ru@@ de . &quot;
&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to exac@@ erb@@ ate limits for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ gram of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but this is called &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they keep the planned maximum values already today . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of c@@ lich@@ és is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ant distr@@ action manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a heavy metal which is highly poison@@ ous for the human being that is heavily enriched above the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; already small amounts can particularly cause damage to the nervous system in the case of un@@ born damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is primarily due to coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information by the Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations met with Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish around the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and nationwide crossed , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; had been quoted from paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warning of mer@@ cury in fish was already among the most common reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ SF@@ F . &quot;
