a ) i ) The organization fet@@ ches the consent of the Community and the States to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) Provi@@ des the community either against a proposed nom@@ ination or at any point against a deliber@@ ate designation , the organization of the Community and States proposes one or more alternative denom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; if due to the re@@ peti@@ tive refusal of the community to agree to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors of the organization , the Council shall discuss the refusal after it is referred to as the General Director of the Organization - in the following as &quot; the General Director &quot; - with the aim of meeting the appropriate measure . &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the States concerned must take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization , according to their Convention , can actually grant them . &quot;
( C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are arranged in such a way that i ) are as little as possible the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and dis@@ ruption to the community and the states and for which the inspec@@ tions of underlying peaceful nuclear activities are as little as possible ;
II ) ensuring the protection of industrial secrets and other inspec@@ tors of the organization to be aware of confidential information .
&quot; each State applies to the organization , including its assets , assets and assets , as well as to its inspec@@ tors and other officials , fulfilling the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the Privileg@@ es and Liberation of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the safety measures after this agreement are termin@@ ated with regard to core material when the community and the organization realize that it is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable for nuclear activity , which is from the point of view of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang , or practically cannot be re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the association noti@@ fies the organization on the basis of this convention , the transfer of nuclear material from the states which is subject to the security measures following this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the safety measures after this agreement are termin@@ ated with regard to nuclear material as soon as the receiving state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , took over responsibility . &quot;
the organisation carries out documents from which each passing on and if necessary the re @-@ use of the securing measures will result in the given core material .
&quot; core material , which is subject to hed@@ ging measures according to this Convention , shall be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , so the association with the organization agrees with such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures after this agreement can be termin@@ ated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material is not used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives in the period of non @-@ application of the safety measures after this Convention .
&quot; B ) The organisation and the community agree to the provision that the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Agreement will not be applied only for so long , when the core material is used in such an activity . &quot;
&quot; in the scheme , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these security measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is kept on the current account of the total quantity and composition of this material in the state or in the states concerned , and on any transfer of such material from this state or those states . &quot;
&quot; this explains their comprehen@@ sion as quickly as possible ; it extends only to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural rules and agreements for reporting , but does not include a approval or an under sec@@ rec@@ y of the military activity , and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the States bear the costs that each of them will grow in the execution of their respective obligations under the Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereign power , however , are subject to extraordinary expenses due to a special request of the organization , so the organisation reimbur@@ ses these costs , provided that it has been subject to it in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation contributes to the cost of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that the liability protection for nuclear damages , including an insurance or other financial security , shall be applied to the organization and its officials for the purposes of conducting this convention in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with international law , any claim entitled to the Community or State to the Organization or the Organisation for any damage - except for damages from a nuclear incident which arose from the implementation of the security measures pursuant to this Convention , is governed in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; after checking the relevant information presented to him by the General Director , the Council shall not be able to verify that any nuclear material which has to be secured pursuant to this Convention for nuclear weapons or other nuclear weapons , may also permit the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , take the measures envis@@ aged there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council takes into account what measures have been acquired by the applied safety measures , and provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is concerned - any representation opportunity for the Council to provide the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the organization , community or state consultations take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to ask that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this convention , shall be examined by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the Community and the affected State to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disputes due to a statement by Article 19 or any action taken by the Council , disputes resulting from the interpretation or application of this convention shall be settled on the request of a party to submit an Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal , consisting of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four nominated arbitr@@ ators choose a fifth to pres@@ ide . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organization have not appointed two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application for an arbit@@ ration , the community or organization may seek to appoint the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint those arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure is to be applied , if within thirty days of the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator , the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected . &quot;
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent and all resolutions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be binding for the organization , the Community and the States concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Agreement shall apply to non @-@ nuclear states , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the Community , in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this convention and &quot;
( II ) if the organization of the organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures concerning this state for the purposes of this convention .
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the States consul@@ ate one another on request of one of the contracting parties about a change of this convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
&quot; C ) The General Manager immediately teaches all member states of the organization , immediately by any change of this convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force on the day when the organization of the Community and the States receive the written notification , that their procedures are concluded for the entry into force . &quot;
B ) The Convention remains in effect as long as the states are contracting parties of the contract .
the expression &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement represents the Convention and the Protocol .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied during the implementation of the provisions of Part I regarding securing measures .
&quot; the aim of the safety measures determined in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bi@@ fur@@ cation of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other core explo@@ sives for unknown purposes , as well as det@@ err@@ ence from such an exit by the risk of premature discovery . &quot;
&quot; to obtain the goal specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial integration and observation as important supple@@ mental measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical completion of the veri@@ fications by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which material quantity for each material balance zone is specified for a certain period of non @-@ proven material quantity , indicating the accuracy limit for the specified ranges . &quot;
&quot; in order to carry out their investigations , the organization will make full use of the security system of the community after article 3 . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in applying its securing measures , the community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are determined and useful in the supple@@ mentary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the continu@@ ance of the core material and the continu@@ ance ; &quot;
B ) evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Proced@@ ure to determine , test and evaluate differences in the measurements of the sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) procedures to evaluate accumulation of non @-@ measured continu@@ ances and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol - and report system , which contains the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory , including the one @-@ and @-@ out of the material balance zone ; &quot;
provisions ensuring that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safety measures following this agreement are not related to material in mining or ore treatment .
&quot; B ) Uran@@ ium or th@@ orium material , which the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) has not yet been reached , is introduced into the States , so the association of the organisation shares the quantity and composition of the material , if it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) the core material , which is suitable according to composition and purity for fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced or is imported into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circuit , it is subject to the other hed@@ ging measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The precau@@ tionary measures envis@@ aged in this Agreement are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions stipul@@ ated in Article 11 . if the provisions stipul@@ ated in Article 11 are not permitted or desirable , the organization and community will consult each other concerning the use of appropriate securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The precau@@ tions envis@@ aged in this Agreement will be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions stipul@@ ated in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community con@@ scienti@@ ously notice that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the Community , the organisation liber@@ ates the following core material from the security measures following this agreement : &quot;
&quot; a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material , if it is used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ; &quot;
&quot; B ) core material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after article 13 if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organization liber@@ ates core material that would otherwise be subject to security measures following this agreement , provided that the total amount of nuclear material freed in the States is at no point at any time than &quot;
&quot; a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of particular material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials : &quot;
&quot; ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; ur@@ anium with a enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the nature ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; to be processed or stored together with core material that is subject to the safety measures following this Convention , precau@@ tions are made for re @-@ use of the securing measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organisation supple@@ mentary agreements , which is necessary in the scope which is required for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention , in particular as to the procedures specified in the Convention . &quot;
the supple@@ mentary agreements can be extended or changed without changing the agreement in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supple@@ mentary agreements entered into force at the same time as soon as possible after the entry into force . the organization , the community and the States undertake all the efforts to make these agreements in force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force ; an extension of this period requires a link between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report specified in Article 62 , the organization provides a summ@@ arized app@@ rais@@ al of all the core materials underlying this convention in the states , irrespective of its origin , and continues this continu@@ ance directory as a result of the following reports and the results of their investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action plan established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is ham@@ pered by general res@@ sources problems . &quot;
&quot; ( C ) It is the objective of the E@@ EC and Member States that the entire contribution of the Member States is bound by the agreement within six months following the entry into force of the agreement , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ EC and the Organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the Organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table from which it is inten@@ tionally intended to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization direc@@ ts a special account under the term &quot; &quot; Special Account &quot; , &quot; which consists of the funds made by the Member States pursuant to this agreement to the Special Trade Account ; this account is referred to as &quot; &quot; administrator &quot; &quot; by the organization , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the Special Rec@@ ei@@ vable account is seg@@ reg@@ ated separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or inde@@ bt@@ ful deb@@ tors of the Member State , which must be paid upon demand in the currency of the State at order of the organization as an administrator of the special transaction account and depos@@ ited in the background of the organization in the respective country . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , and i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or another between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed at the time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time , which agreed between the E@@ EC and the Administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Any Member State may make payments before the above @-@ mentioned appointments .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about proportional actions on cash or school ey@@ esh@@ adow to cover spending on the promotion loans and to balance the off@@ ence account appropriately . &quot;
&quot; in the event of gran@@ ting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the E@@ EC : &quot;
III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit facility capacity to loan conditions ; and
VII ) The extent in which the problems of the countries concerned are regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each Special loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly pay@@ able development program or project , irrespective of whether it belongs to the organisation of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices which are considered for the purpose of the organization financed by the organization , whereby the purpose stated under letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement is to be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the Special Trade Account may not be used instead of proper means of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation for the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special loan terms are subject to the same pay@@ back conditions which are generally considered by the Organisation for Development loans ; thus , they are pay@@ able in 10 years of age in 50 years . &quot;
these loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that re@@ tains them .
&quot; each loan agreement is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is given in particular . &quot;
&quot; the recei@@ pts from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are manufactured or made . ( ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization , and that according to what the car@@ et@@ aker specified at the time of the loan agreement , recei@@ vers of a promotion loan . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of F@@ ee loans are made to the special transaction , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state is to be transferred back as soon as possible by the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State . &quot;
&quot; the administrator has instruc@@ ted the E@@ EC to complete all Special Administr@@ ations , the E@@ EC concerning the plans and programs authorized by the directors in preparation for the examination by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of rep@@ ay@@ ment of the special transaction loan , the administrator has informed the EE@@ A quar@@ terly on the development of the promotion loans and the expenses made for this purpose . &quot;
the administrator transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed invoice of the special transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this statement .
&quot; as soon as possible , the E@@ EC &apos;s ste@@ ward sends a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the Special Rec@@ ession account . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker shall create and carry out appropriate records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are borrow@@ ed from the account recei@@ pts and the amounts paid to the account , and the payments to the Member States are obvious . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ akers are working closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker until the full issue of the funds of the special @-@ action account from time to time , have an exchange of ideas about the state of the special action account , the progress of the programs or projects financed by special action accounts , and on any other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , the E@@ EC and the Organisation may not be entered into force , the agreement and all parties resulting from it are due to immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; if the full capital amount of all the recei@@ v@@ ables accepted by the recipients in accordance with Article II section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all parties resulting there@@ from are termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the governments of the Member States noti@@ fying the Council of the Council of the European Communities from the Council of the Council of the European Communities .
the General Sec@@ retariat guides these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the per@@ missible authorisation of this Agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organisation .
this agreement becomes effective and takes effect on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
&quot; this agreement is written in two Ur@@ als in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , each wor@@ ding is equally binding . &quot;
&quot; whereas the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a letter change to the amend@@ ment of the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ DE VER@@ Y@@ THING : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large pilot plant , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are transferred to a joint company after Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Joint Business J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been involved in research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; as far as the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is still to be carried out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contractual parties of the present agreement to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research work that has attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement will enable any contracting party to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps , and consequently the common objective of this research , i.e. the cost @-@ effective electricity production by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction to reach faster . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the goal of the present agreement , the parties associate their respective research programmes defined in App@@ endi@@ x I and II , following the &quot; Eur@@ atom program &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation between the Eur@@ atom program ; it is extended or amended by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; each time the parties accept a new program , it occurs in the place of the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot;
&quot; the association , which is envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 , is realised by : - adequate participation of any of the parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ; &quot;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom countries , in Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as associated &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories accompanying the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
&quot; as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland is participating in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of carrying out the association stipul@@ ated in Article 2 Section 1 of this Agreement , the Parties shall conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; association agreement , &quot; which is referred to as far as possible to those established between the Commission and the States and companies or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ iz@@ ations , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of human resources , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Human Resource exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the J@@ ET joint company with the date of entering into force , its stat@@ ute accepts it . &quot;
&quot; Eur@@ atom is also concerned that Switzerland may become a contract partner of any contract , with the exception of association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement . &quot;
the governing bodies responsible for carrying out the association specified in Article 2 Par@@ ag@@ raph 1 of the present Agreement shall be described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement .
&quot; the association agreement must , in particular , include setting up a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
to monitor the development of the research work and to direct the best possible results in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two deleg@@ ations in the connection group used as part of the Eur@@ atom program - herein@@ after called &quot; V@@ G . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ G , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters related to current or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , is responsible for all research and development activities relating to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and establishes their T * const@@ ancy in the interest of the two contracting parties to the common objective defined in the Eur@@ atom program and in the Swiss programme , as well as to be du@@ ly considered in the world of significant scientific and technological developments . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the V@@ G ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives to the Advisory Group , created within the Eur@@ atom program , whenever the relevant Swiss authorities consult . &quot;
&quot; the advice groups that the V@@ G suggest that the funds granted for the Eur@@ atom program provide the best possible scientific results , taking this task in relation to all research and development work undertaken in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; as part of the Eur@@ atom program , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the laboratories involved . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of Directors , which has to monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the programme , inv@@ ali@@ date this task in respect of all research and development work undertaken pursuant to the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , he is responsible for the best possible use of personnel and for the exchange of the same between laboratories involved in the execution of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss programme . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to take part in meetings of all coordin@@ ating committees deployed within the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; coordin@@ ating committees , which offer the best possible use of the resources , the personnel , and the knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , will carry out this task in the respective field with respect to all research and development work undertaken pursuant to the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; BA@@ F is a member responsible for the core and energy research of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advis@@ es the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the directions as well as in preparing its overall scope , coordination and integration of national activities at community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; statements of the BA@@ F , the V@@ G , the Committee of Directors , the Advisory Group and the coordin@@ ating committees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the statement of the V@@ G to the urgent action is obligatory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the field of personnel exchange .
&quot; the representatives of the two parties cooperate in the work of all technical advisory boards or all administrative bodies , which will be created for the purposes of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution of Switzerland to the Eur@@ atom program , according to this agreement , is set annually to an amount determined by the Eur@@ atom program at the cost of the Eur@@ atom program in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; concerning the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the stake of Eur@@ atom on the common enterprise as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Switzerland assign@@ s an amount to the Common Business J@@ ET , which is defined in accordance with the provisions of the Stat@@ ute of this Joint Company . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom is capable of financing the work as part of the association agreement and the agreement on human resource exchange , is calculated on the same basis that is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out due to the corresponding contracts . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the Federal Council will rep@@ ay the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
July . the other payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are specified in Anne@@ x III of the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland sei@@ zes all necessary measures to allow Eur@@ atom from duties or other donations as well as import restrictions and restrictions on the part of the objects that are financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;

agreement on the form of a change between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on mobil@@ ising the demands of the Member States as part of the medium @-@ term financial advisory board
&quot; the BIS could conclude Stand@@ by loan agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries , if the banks present a corresponding application . &quot;
&quot; the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , and within a total limit of € 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future deplo@@ y@@ ments of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; even now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for which the BI@@ Z would be prepared . &quot;
&quot; at any stand@@ by credit , the BIS would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , but without a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; in the opening of the loans , as well as during their extension , the BIS would charge a credit opening fee . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first draws would not be made before the end of a month after the Stand@@ by agreement was concluded so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the withdraw@@ als would take place in the currencies at the disposal of the agreement at the disposal of the agreement , very likely in U.S. dollars ; they would extend to periods which would take into account the means of the Bank , expected three or six months . &quot;
&quot; conditions would correspond to those that would apply the BIS at the respective time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BIS must obtain the required resources on the market itself , the interest rate coming to the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to the raised Li@@ bor in order to apply . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .

in the form of a change between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
&quot; I honor me to take on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat from the Community . &quot;
&quot; - Fresh or cold H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in poultry weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to guarantee a faul@@ t@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina comm@@ its to ensure that the agreed amount of the annual amount does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out in accordance with the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the Committee mentioned under No. 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community uses the protective clause , it oblig@@ ates itself to ensure that the access to Argentina regulated in this agreement does not affect the common market . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end the imports from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned . &quot;
&quot; the community obli@@ ges itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of products covered by this agreement , to a stool set of 10 v.@@ h . ad val@@ or@@ em . &quot;
&quot; with the entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes Argentina &apos;s number 2 according to the volume of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , the import loads for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this shall be taken into account under the aforementioned clause of the contract . &quot;
&quot; the total volume stated under number 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 23@@ ,000 tons of car@@ c@@ age weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community meets precau@@ tions so that the sales of intervention stocks of frozen meat are not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the regulation , the sales of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual use of reimbur@@ s@@ ements or other funding measures for the export of sheep and lamb , as well as for slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , will only take place in accordance with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade association with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are to be interpreted in a way that is compatible with article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and , in particular , corresponds to Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the general customs and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; in this agreement , Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular , that quot@@ ations specified in this agreement are issued for the products mentioned under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the community itself ple@@ dges to meet all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products origin@@ ates in Argentina from the presentation of an export license issued by the authorities designated by the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that on the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the question@@ able products can be dispens@@ ed .
&quot; in addition , it is stipul@@ ated that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals has issued the quantities issued for export licensing ; these data may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and runs smoothly .
&quot; he regularly reviews the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat @-@ meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including the conditions mentioned for the purpose mentioned under number 7 . &quot;

&quot; recogni@@ zing the fact that the sheep farming and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb after the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy is vital and that it is necessary to ensure that the normal sales of New Zealand amm@@ el and lamb on these markets is not affected , I sincer@@ ely honor the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - Fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; after this agreement , New Zealand is ensured for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat of access to the market of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand preser@@ ves the assurance that the normal passage of his H@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ b@@ ast meat is not affected by the application of the Ord@@ in@@ ance .
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand comm@@ its itself to ensure that the stated annual amount does not exceed the set amount . &quot;

the ti@@ ter is measured using always renewed di@@ lution of the re@@ agent on the double in a suitable medium .
&quot; the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um di@@ lution , in which a reaction occurs ; the th@@ inning is calculated exclusively by volume of the flow of blood in the total volume . &quot;
&quot; in Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on slides , the activity is expressed through the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B , as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for the blood group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ary which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
&quot; the ti@@ ter indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mixture within a series , in which a micro@@ sc@@ opic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which the International standard preparations are present ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the Tit@@ ration of the unknown agent in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) . &quot;

&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain for at least one year . &quot;
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agent in flu@@ ffy form according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents concerned on the label is based on the results of the availability tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of iner@@ ated gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they are dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate . &quot;
&quot; a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0,5 % of its weight , if it is tested by further drying about phosph@@ or@@ rhe@@ a in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent authorities can determine that the agent ( or the solv@@ ents supplied with the des@@ ic@@ re@@ agents ) is an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent has the requirements for specific@@ ity and efficacy . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml flu@@ ffy or re@@ dissolved ser@@ um .

&quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
&quot; the quantity demanded in a container must be so large , that the contents may be used to carry out the effectiveness tests described in this protocol . &quot;
the manufacturing laboratory has to carry out written records on all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agent re@@ agents are so long to be kept from the lab until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
&quot; the re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and preservation of the re@@ agent &apos;s stability . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups following the origin of their active component . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; on each individual container , a black on white printed label is available in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the ser@@ um should react with blood cells containing the Do @-@ An@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended to use object gir@@ ders according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with in@@ undation of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; therefore , these ser@@ a@@ vers are only specific to the C @-@ an@@ tigen when the blood cells tested are sin@@ king in a 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de solution . &quot;
the titanium of the anti @-@ C ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ dee @-@ blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on property carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;

anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on property carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and in no form anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised individuals or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E ser@@ um .
&quot; in a given ser@@ um , both antibodies must be effective at the same time as specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a ser@@ um is intended for use on property carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ations@@ zeit lies with all types of red blood cells that show a reaction , not less than with the propor@@ tion@@ ate antibodies . &quot;

&quot; in the expectation that the Community agreed within the Action Programme to strengthen the Single Market , as of 1 January 1988 , in in@@ tra @-@ Community trade of goods , it has decided to introduce a unified administrative institution , &quot;
&quot; considering that it is appropriate to simplify also the conveni@@ ences in goods traffic between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by implementing a uniform administration document ; &quot;
&quot; in the expectation that this Convention may not be designed to fulfil its obligations arising from other international conventions , &quot;
&quot; in this agreement , measures are set to simplify the conveni@@ ences in goods transport between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries and between the individual EF@@ TA countries and in particular , a uniform management package ( herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; uni@@ formity &quot; &quot; ) is to be used for all export and import procedures as well as for goods transport between the contracting parties ( herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; shipping method &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;

&quot; in this respect , the development of technology and the structures of international trade necess@@ it@@ ates significant changes in the Brussels Agreement of 15 December 1950 on the tari@@ ff schema for the import of goods into customs tari@@ ffs , &quot;
&quot; further IN DER Re@@ alization , that the level of differentiation required by governments and the economy for tari@@ ff and statistical purposes is currently far beyond that which is included in the system to the aforementioned agreement , &quot;
&quot; considering that it is important to have accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations , &quot;
&quot; in the expectation that the harmon@@ ized system should be used for freight rates and transport statistics of various transport types , &quot;
&quot; in the expectation that the harmon@@ ized system is destined to be accepted as far as possible into the systems used in the trade for the designation and enco@@ ding of the goods , &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the harmon@@ ized system should help to maintain a close relationship between the import and export statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the other hand , IN DER Re@@ duction , that a close relationship between the harmon@@ ised system and the International Monetary System ( S@@ IT@@ C ) of the United Nations is to be maintained . &quot;
&quot; in the expectation that it is desirable to comply with the requirements listed above by a combined tari@@ ff tari@@ ff and statistical en@@ cl@@ ature , which is appropri@@ ated for use by those involved in international trade , &quot;
&quot; considering that it is important to ensure adaptation of the harmon@@ ized system to the development of technology and the structures of international commerce , &quot;

&quot; the parties of the agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on the establishment of a Council for Cooperation in the area of Cust@@ oms Service , signed in Brussels &quot;
&quot; it is desirable that on June 14 , 1983 , the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and enco@@ ding of the goods entered into force on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in THE statement , that without a change in Article 13 of the stated convention at the time of the entry into force of this Convention remain uncertain - &quot;
&quot; in Article 13 of the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and enco@@ ding of the goods , referred to in Brussels on 14 June 1983 , in the following &quot; Convention , &quot; paragraph 1 receives the following draft : &quot;

&quot; A. This protocol acts simultaneously with the Convention in force , if at least sev@@ ent@@ een of the states or customs or economic uni@@ ons registered in Article 11 of the Convention on the adoption of the protocol at the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council for cooperation in the field of customs duties . &quot;
&quot; however , only states or tari@@ ff or economic uni@@ on@@ ists can deposit the document on the adoption of this protocol , which have previously signed the agreement without reservation of rati@@ fication , or at the same time under@@ pin the rati@@ fication or the accession to the Convention , or at the same time depos@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; B. E@@ ach state and any customs or economic union , the contracting party of the Convention according to the entry into force of this protocol in accordance with paragraph A , is the contracting party of the Convention in the amended version . &quot;
&quot; a plant that is indispensable not only for the maintenance and conservation of soil , but also allows the exploitation of land , which does not allow any other planting , and which makes the main part of today &apos;s production favourable to any improvement of cultivation methods , &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ VE@@ IS DAR@@ AU@@ F , that from its cultivation the existence and living standards of millions of families depend entirely on the actions necessary to maintain and extend the consumption of olive products in the producer countries themselves and in the non @-@ producing consumer countries ; &quot;
