this document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evalu@@ ates the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
&quot; if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed compounds ( tablets that are dissolved in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; pres@@ upp@@ ose thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a mental disorder , in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high @-@ tuning ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used for treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for preventing man@@ ic episodes in patients who have approached the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances when the oral intake of the medication is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for inhal@@ ing or melt tissue in patients with the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines that are similar to abili@@ fy , the dose of abili@@ fy should be adapted . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to one another . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l is probably mainly used as a partial ag@@ ony for the recep@@ tors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but has a lower degree than neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alising the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing recur@@ rence . &quot;
the effectiveness of abili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms was investigated in three studies lasting up to one year .
&quot; the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , or similar disorders that were suffering from anxiety , over a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in another study comparing the efficacy of abili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with abili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which were subjected to increased rest@@ lessness , with the one by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the changes in the patient &apos;s symptoms were examined based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responded to the treatment . &quot;
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ bs the melt tabl@@ etten and the solution to the intake .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received abili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15@@ mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than those receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo . &quot;
abili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effectively than placebo for the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of abili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yram@@ idal disorders ( un@@ controlled ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who predominantly used man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes applied to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution during the rapid check of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of abili@@ fy across the European Union . &quot;
abili@@ fy is indicated for treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and discussed their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness of dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy amounts to 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases following the start or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ emic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia present during treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy symptoms and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia should be considered , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a grain , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including abili@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study of a fixed dosage , a significant correlation between the dosage and response to undes@@ ired cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including abili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ th@@ enia , poly@@ uria , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ics and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy li@@ festy@@ les and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with over@@ bearing side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ il@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l , whereby this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ is@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; considering the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height before beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with abili@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ mag@@ enta concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ ine / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; this drug may not be used in pregnancy because of insufficient data security and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies in the animal , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l does not have any negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l , a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ione , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS obtained 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % was in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
&quot; man@@ ic episodes in polar I disorder - in a controlled trial over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23,@@ 5 % was in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ sis treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase of over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ sis treatment and 15.@@ 7 % was treated for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ mag@@ enta compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects related to an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and the incidence of mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , ha@@ y@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and conv@@ ul@@ sions , undes@@ ired cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose , since Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma probe . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is medi@@ ated in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recep@@ tors , and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recep@@ tors and for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine receptor . &quot;
&quot; dose @-@ emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ depend@@ ant reduction in the binding of 11@@ c @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a half @-@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ dents who inter@@ viewed the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary re@@ agents , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sive Res@@ ume Rate , showed a significantly greater improvement compared to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher decline in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ zo@@ l group and at 57 % among placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study potential &quot; &quot; weight gain &quot; &quot; was a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ zo@@ l showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo superior to placebo , comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially over 2 weeks were not applied to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic indications , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial for over 26 weeks , followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase more than 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ zi@@ zo@@ l showed in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ations of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ losing is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean Eli@@ mination of Eli@@ mination is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l with extensive metabol@@ is@@ ers about CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ iz@@ ier@@ ern via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , and in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients no gender @-@ dependent effects were observed . &quot;
a Pop@@ ulations @-@ specific evaluation for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not indicate clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to the eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for the human being . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no significance for clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ depend@@ ant adren@@ al rin@@ se toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the mean @-@ level Ste@@ ady State Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of 30 mg of concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l were no more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of apes , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which lead to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold of the medium @-@ term Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; perfor@@ ated bli@@ ster packs for dispens@@ ing of single doses of aluminium in folding boxes with 14 x 1 , 28 x 1 , 49 x 1 , 56 x 1 , 98 x 1 tablet . &quot;
&quot; 15 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia present during treatment . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is medi@@ ated in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recep@@ tors , and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; 22 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial for over 26 weeks , followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase more than 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ zi@@ zo@@ l showed in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing ap@@ bili@@ fy tablets , can take the processed tablets alternative to abili@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders have been reported in some cases following the start or after change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic treatment even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia present during treatment . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a tooth are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , altern@@ ating levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and irregular heart@@ beat ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ics and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy li@@ festy@@ les and could lead to serious complications . &quot;

&quot; 92 In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with abili@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ mag@@ enta concentrations .
&quot; man@@ ic episodes in polar I disorder - in a controlled trial over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23,@@ 5 % was in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ z@@ ol@@ - &quot;
&quot; it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is medi@@ ated in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recep@@ tors , and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study potential &quot; &quot; weight gain &quot; &quot; was a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which lead to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold of the medium @-@ term Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections are used for quick checks of di@@ gest@@ ing and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral treatment is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be termin@@ ated with Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ zo@@ l injection solution and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; to boost res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle under circum@@ vention of obes@@ e regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given to medicines prescribed for maintenance or ac@@ ut therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to abili@@ fy tablets , abili@@ fy Mel@@ ting tablets or abili@@ fy solution . &quot;
&quot; there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with di@@ vis@@ cosity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were caused differently compared to schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder . &quot;
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ zo@@ l injection solution is considered necessary , patients should be observed with regard to an extreme sed@@ ation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ zi@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug toxic@@ ity ( prescribed or illegal medicines ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ emic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia present during treatment . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a brain are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , altern@@ ating levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and irregular heart@@ beat ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ th@@ enia , poly@@ uria , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy li@@ festy@@ les and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of Sed@@ ation was greater compared with the dose of Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly applied and the simultaneously receiving lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ il@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l , whereby this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height before beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater compared to that according to sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ mag@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
the following side effects were more common in clinical studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ zo@@ l injection solution more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined in accordance with the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) : &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS obtained 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ z@@ ola treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ sis treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase of over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % was treated for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects related to an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and the incidence of mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , ha@@ y@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and conv@@ ul@@ sions , undes@@ ired cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; 110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances , the Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with statisti@@ cally significant major improvements of Agi@@ ti@@ bility / Behavior disturb@@ ances compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as Agi@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances , the Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement in the symptoms of the ch@@ apped and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the average improvement seen from the initial value on the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score with the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe app@@ rais@@ al , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population but a statistical significance could be detected due to a decreased patient number . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a half @-@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ dents who had a response to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary studio destinations , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg Dep@@ res@@ sions Rate , showed a significantly greater improvement compared to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher decline in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % among placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study potential &quot; &quot; weight gain &quot; &quot; was a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially over 2 weeks were not applied to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic indications , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ doc@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ zi@@ zo@@ l showed an improvement in the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after intr@@ amus@@ cular injection , Ari@@ pi@@ pre@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % greater the AU@@ C according to administration of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the middle time was applied until reaching the maximum plasma level at 1 to 3 hours . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15 or 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intr@@ amus@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity after IV application , no safety @-@ related concerns were taken after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15 - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ mal ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , the pre@@ clinical data did not identify any particular haz@@ ards for the human being . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects have only been observed in doses or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; thus they have limited or no meaning for clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ depend@@ ant adren@@ al @-@ nit@@ rate toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which lead to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ times the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane has been studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which three quarters of which had previously received an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug contained in conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; if only patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time and deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival . &quot;
patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer demonstrated in relation to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; it may also not be used in patients , breast@@ feeding or before beginning treatment have low neut@@ ro@@ phy@@ lic numbers in the blood . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) stated that in patients the first treatment did not affect more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel drugs and that it must not be given with other medicines in contrast to other p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel in order to reduce side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients , in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine therapy ( see also Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ us number &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series . &quot;
&quot; for sensor@@ ic N@@ europ@@ ath@@ ie Grade 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose should be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for dosage recommendations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see paragraph 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were carried out with patients with imp@@ aired ren@@ al function and there are currently no sufficient data for recomm@@ ending dose adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
abrasion Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nano @-@ artic@@ ulated formulation of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which could have much more pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ fuels has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; cardi@@ al incidents in the inde@@ xed patient lens are not un@@ common , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients following the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive remedies . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or for women in child@@ bearing age , which are not effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
women at child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ tion method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised , during and up to six months after the treatment no child is to bear . &quot;
&quot; male patients should be advised against the treatment of a sper@@ mat@@ ological treatment prior to treatment , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot;
abrasion can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect the traffic and ability to serve machines .
&quot; the most common and most important incidents of adverse events occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane during the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study . &quot;
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( in 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 lists the side effects associated with the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased l@@ act@@ ate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;

&quot; as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established . &quot;
p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active agent that promotes co@@ ag@@ ulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ ae and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ ol@@ arization .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma @-@ components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel by the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation occurs in the tumor area .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two prob@@ able non@@ blind@@ ed studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
&quot; in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multic@@ entr@@ e study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , either in the form of a solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a negative general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ asis . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asing and 19 % because of metast@@ asing and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 Results for the general response rate and time until progression of the disease , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are shown below . &quot;
&quot; neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a grade for patients , who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 at a time during therapy . &quot;
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy as a result of the cum@@ ulative Tox@@ ic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the Total p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel in 30 and 180 minutes inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
&quot; exposure to active ingredient ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , an@@ alogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; 10 After the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration gradually decreased in a multi@@ phase manner . &quot;
the middle distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or soft connection of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel were compared with a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ based p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearance of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) compared to a solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel @-@ injection and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
&quot; in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) . &quot;
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for a cum@@ ulative total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel resulted in a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
however only a few data were available about patients at the age of more than 75 years because only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was protected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light over 8 hours .

member states must ensure that the holder of approval for the placing on the market prior to the launch of the medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail stores with the following information and materials is provided :
&quot; • Educational brochures • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging solutions . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; reference doctors &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron , in which blood trans@@ fusion complications could occur in cases where blood loss is not possible before surgery , and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in treating patients with diseases that the medicine is showing .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection may also be performed by the patient or his assistant , provided they have received appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron levels of all patients are to be controlled before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be given throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency , or that the body does not sufficiently address the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been produced , which enables them to form ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with chemotherapy in a vein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , with the reference drug . &quot;
all patients participating in this study were inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to abor@@ amed or continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed , inj@@ ected under the skin , were tested with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of patients treated in Ab@@ se@@ amed were kept to the same degree as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the starting value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ sin@@ ase &apos;s most common side effect is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ating mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , since further studies are needed to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Ab@@ se@@ amed has proven to be a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , which makes Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for medical personnel in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the Company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the placing of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union . &quot;

&quot; H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which can not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program . &quot;
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration lies between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease load ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels can occasionally be observed in a patient or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels increase by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose that is required to check an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia .
this clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
this clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.6 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by using IV application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms and consequ@@ ential effects may vary depending on age , gender and total disease load ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 weeks of treatment of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ ular ratio of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be kept three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ ular number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loid mass of ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be preserved three times a week . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) resp@@ . the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loid count increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l against the initial value , an appeal to ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be cancelled . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ jun@@ c@@ tors is required , should be obtained twice a week in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgery . &quot;
&quot; iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program begins , so that large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of intervention ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ operative 300 I.@@ U. / kg each for 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection may be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula pin , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients who develop under the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin at a ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ oma ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ oma ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , unstable Ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or gr@@ ind@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; in patients with a brief heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ oma ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
&quot; patients with sudden loss of action , defined as a reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , should be investigated by the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value and the usual causes for non @-@ response ( iron , fol@@ ate or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ u toxic@@ ation , infection or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ y@@ te Index ) , decreases ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies are determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be investigated for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy in Section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , elevated mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ - target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit due to the application of ep@@ ox@@ ins when the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased to the concentration of an@@ a@@ emia and avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in intake should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in case of tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin response should be taken into account for ass@@ essing the treatment efficiency of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who may need to be trans@@ figured ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is larger than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose should be adjusted for possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk weighing under the involvement of the respective patient which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the onset of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a output level of &gt; 13 g / dl may have increased risk of postoperative oste@@ op@@ last@@ y / vascular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine has not been proven that tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia improve overall survival or reduce the risk of progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
&quot; ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dosage should be adapted to increasing hem@@ at@@ ost@@ asis . &quot;
&quot; from in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of interaction between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al attacks , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@
the most common side effect during the treatment with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
&quot; irrespective of the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the gene@@ tically recovered ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and is identical with the end@@ ogen@@ ous human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , isolated from the urine of an@@ emic patients . &quot;
&quot; it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; 38@@ 9 patients with hem@@ og@@ lob@@ oses ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Hod@@ g@@ kin@@ - Lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ og@@ lob@@ omas ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tum@@ ors ( 172 M@@ amm@@ ak@@ ar@@ cin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 22 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 more ) . &quot;

survival and tumour progression have been studied in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
&quot; in the open trial , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin patients and the patient patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin showed an un@@ solved , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality compared with the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and in control .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated IV application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no accumulation : the level of ser@@ um remains the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first offering or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;

&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or injection in a muscle prior to the first inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to treat the Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta is only prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of hip and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that breaks bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of ver@@ teb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared with placebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) with those among placebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients with placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most A@@ cl@@ asta side effects occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other constitu@@ ents .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cl@@ asta are subjected to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the inf@@ usion and oste@@ onic rose ( dying of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides information for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains instructions on how to apply the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients where they should consult the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the placing of A@@ cl@@ asta in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently discovered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The packaging pad • contra@@ indications in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When using medical or nursing help &quot;
&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently discovered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after a treatment of the Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ asta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients responded to therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , at least twice daily at least 500 m@@ g. of basic calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by means of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with kidney impair@@ ment ( see Section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended since limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary , since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and teenagers A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for the use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data on safety and efficacy is missing .
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to treat calcium and vitamin D before the onset of treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone structure , temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , which usually occurs within the first 10 days following the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , twice daily at least 500 m@@ g. of basic calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be investigated before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental appointments , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan for each patient and be based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by means of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; incidence of adverse events reported by atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ asta ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Recur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the total frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dys@@ functions Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid has been associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions , which are expressed as a decrease in ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing ( measured before administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were similar in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ u and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels observed below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently damaged hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but most of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical trial , local reactions were reported to the inf@@ usion center , such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ onic disorders in the jaw are occ@@ ult , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ gens ( primary in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including poli@@ omyel@@ itis , and most of the reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions . &quot;
&quot; 7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed oste@@ onic rose in the jaw area in a patient treated with A@@ cl@@ asta and a placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosage , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been demonstrated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 to 89 years ) with either a BM@@ D or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2,5 with or without signs of an existing ver@@ teb@@ ra body . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric fac@@ tor@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new ver@@ teb@@ rate structures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of ver@@ teb@@ rate re@@ fraction compared to placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta showed a consistent effect over three years which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased bone density on lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ra , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase of bone density of lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , th@@ aler lower by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ vis after the third annual dose . &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed that patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to placebo an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume and the preservation of the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone architecture .
bone replacement mark@@ ers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) and the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ asta decreased by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
&quot; B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months , and was kept at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months . &quot;
&quot; vitamin D levels were not measured rout@@ inely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion . &quot;
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment in comparison with placebo treatment increased the BM@@ D at all times .
&quot; over 24 months compared to placebo treatment , the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment led to an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total circulation and 4.3 % on fem@@ oral neck . &quot;
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 508 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta compared with the once weekly administration of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the output value .
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment in Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ asta is examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light to moderate Alzheimer &apos;s Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when recording to the study ) . &quot;
11 The efficacy of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence compared to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as resp@@ onder@@ s at the end of the six @-@ month study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in an observ@@ ational phase .
&quot; patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study demonstrated the therapeutic approach in 141 of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 71 of patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , at an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; 5 and 15 minutes lasting inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after this plasma absorption increased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the highest value . &quot;
rapid bi@@ phase disappearance from the great cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ -@@ 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al@@ s@@ wer@@ ts@@ time t ½ . 146 hours .
the early stage phases ( α and β with the t ½ -@@ values above ) presum@@ ably represent rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the given dose is found in urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; total body clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of inf@@ usion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration around time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clearance of cy@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes that is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely , because it is not yet met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans , and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolic @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in 64 patients . &quot;
&quot; this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction down to 35 ml / min , which requires no dosage adjustment of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;
&quot; as for severe kidney dys@@ functions ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ al@@ ous intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; studies in dogs were given single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with IV application , ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was measured in rats , administered in intervals of 0,@@ 6 mg / kg , in intervals of 2 @-@ 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose , which corresponds to the 7@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in accumulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects were observed in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common finding in studies with repeated application was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absorb@@ ant effect of the substance . &quot;
at rats one observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
&quot; in rab@@ bits , no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced ser@@ um calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; usually 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot;

&quot; in July 2007 , on 29 September 2006 , the Pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application is in force and works before and during the product is marketed . &quot;
Ris@@ co @-@ Management Plan The owner of the Auth@@ or@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance Auth@@ or@@ isation Site under@@ takes to conduct trials and additional activities for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance carried out in the Pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 004 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all subsequent versions of the R@@ MP .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP guidelines for risk management systems for human medicine , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a representative of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; declining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the Pa@@ get , the bone structure takes place too quickly , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus giving strength to the bones . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; if you are using A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines , tell your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if you are taking / applying or applying other medicines , even if it is not prescription . &quot;
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs that is known to damage the kid@@ neys .
&quot; when applying A@@ cl@@ asta together with foods and drinks , you are worried that you will get enough liquids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an inf@@ usion into a vein . &quot;
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make A@@ cl@@ ue appointments two or more weeks after the operative treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the usual dose is 5 mg , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an inf@@ usion into a vein . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ asta is working for a long time , you may need a further dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after inf@@ usion .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta can work more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta is missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before the treatment ends with A@@ cl@@ asta if you are considering the cess@@ ation of treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , please notice your next appointment and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; adverse events associated with the first inf@@ usion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of the patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent inf@@ usions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache occur within the first three days of the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether A@@ cl@@ asta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms at yourself after you have received A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs due to low cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially around the mouth . &quot;
&quot; num@@ b , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , fatigue , ting@@ ling , num@@ b@@ ness , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , diar@@ rhe@@ a , anxiety , pain , it@@ ching , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , red@@ ness , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase of ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins , tissue wave and thirst . &quot;
prolonged sor@@ eness and / or healing wounds in the mouth or j@@ aws were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not listed in this usage information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot;
patients with a recently l@@ itt@@ ingly low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to make A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , patients need to be sufficiently hydr@@ ated ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone structure , temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atically dissi@@ p@@ ated , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , at least twice daily 500 m@@ g. of basic calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently l@@ itt@@ ingly low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;

&quot; in addition , four studies were conducted in more than 7 000 patients where A@@ comp@@ lia was used in comparison to placebo as a suppor@@ tive remedy for the cess@@ ation of smoking . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , studies on the setting of smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and upper respiratory tract infections were observed . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who are suffering from severe depression or treated with anti @-@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can give rise to a small minority of patients su@@ ic@@ idal thoughts . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable when applying A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ comp@@ lia &apos;s effectiveness in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or over@@ weight cuts
&quot; medicines used in patients who need it for health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing information packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; in addition to diet and exercise to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or over@@ weight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to lack of data for efficacy and safety .
&quot; depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ic@@ idal thoughts in up to 1 % of the patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefits of treatment in the individual case out@@ weigh the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - in addition to obesity - do not have noticeable risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other nearby people may point out that it is necessary to monitor the re @-@ occurrence of such symptoms and immediately consult doctor &apos;s advice when these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been sufficiently demonstrated .
patients with cardiovascular events ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .
&quot; ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , St. John &apos;s Wort , is assumed that the simultaneous administration of potent CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tors is the plas@@ mac@@ on@@ isation of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with obesity have been examined , and in addition to 38 patients in other indications . &quot;
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients who were treated for weight loss and for accompanying metabolic diseases .
it was statisti@@ cally significant if the incidence was statisti@@ cally higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for undes@@ irable effects &lt; 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for undes@@ irable effects &lt; 1 % ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; often ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rarely ( ≥ 0.@@ 01 , &lt; 0,1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
&quot; in a comparative study , in which a limited number of people were administered up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed . &quot;
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year was 20 mg 6.5 kg for A@@ comp@@ lia , compared to the initial value compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg and 1.2 kg in the placebo group ( difference -@@ 3,@@ 8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4,4 , -@@ 3,@@ 3 ; p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; after 2 years the difference in total weight reduction between A@@ comp@@ lia and placebo -@@ 4,@@ 2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,0 % ; -@@ 3.4 , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 weight reduction and other risk factors In the studies in patients with no diabetes , in which a mixed population of patients with &quot;
&quot; under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average waste of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des of 6.@@ 9 % was seen ( bas@@ eline tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des 1,62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.8 % . &quot;
&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an output of 7.9 % for both groups ) was after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 in placebo &quot;
the percentage of patients who reached a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
&quot; the difference in the middle weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3,@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to the direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % due to the weight reduction .
&quot; 2 hours reached , the Ste@@ ady @-@ State plas@@ min@@ ates were reached after 13 days ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 ng / ml ; C@@ trou@@ gh = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14,@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 268 n@@ g.@@ h / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; food influence : he subjects that received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in a so@@ ber@@ ing condition or after a fat @-@ fat meal , increased by 67 % higher C@@ MA@@ x or by 48 % increased &lt; AU@@ C . &quot;
patients with black skin color can have up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C as patients of other ethnic populations .
n popular @-@ based analyses ( age spectrum 18 - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75@@ - year old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on the safety of the adverse adverse effects not observed in clinical studies , which were observed in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic field , were considered to be potentially relevant for clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some , but not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions with proced@@ ural stress as well as dealing with the animals seems to be connected . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no adverse effects were observed on fertility or cycle dis@@ infection . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study on rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and through lac@@ tation did not cause any changes in learning behavior or memory . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evalu@@ ates the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which can not be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin and insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl @-@ hard or insulin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops , so that type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of acet@@ one in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos decreased the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered when using the dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ y study , the effect of an additional dose of acet@@ one for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ yl ure@@ a decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional donation of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of acet@@ one and insulin was studied in 289 patients , patients reported insulin in addition to insulin , lowered the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects related to Ac@@ tos were visual disorders , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ dies@@ thesia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in , Ac@@ tos is used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tos in the whole European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data is available for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 18 , so the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are endangered by presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a car@@ dio @-@ vascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and previously advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , however , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with elevated output liver Enzy@@ mes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 @-@ times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver Enzy@@ mes can be controlled as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that refer to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , over@@ bau@@ ch@@ iness , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ n , the liver Enzy@@ mes are to be examined . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be conducted by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are anticipated .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which may arise from fat deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction in the mean ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in was reduced ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) . &quot;
similar changes were observed in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.1 % and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl ure@@ a , or dual combination therapy with insulin , are the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the market launch was reported under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indi@@ an , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the incidence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed physicians should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report on visual acu@@ ity ; appropriate ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events of adverse events on bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence amounted to 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures experienced in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ision medication . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs the treatment is necessary ( see section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ insulin resistance resulting in pregnancy and thus decreases the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( not available from this data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a transi@@ ent change in the tur@@ g@@ ors and breaking inde@@ xes of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ assumptions about three times the upper limit of the normal range also frequently appear as compared to placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot;
&quot; in an outcome study in patients with advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1,6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ p . &quot;
&quot; since its launch , it has rarely been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , however , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summ@@ ari@@ zing analysis of adverse events on bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies was carried out over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study period over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ision medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to be activated by activ@@ ating specific nuclear recep@@ tors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , which leads in the animal model to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it has been shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance .
&quot; a clinical trial with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect is sur@@ passed ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of two years at the beginning of the therapy , blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite a three @-@ month optimization phase with insulin , were random@@ ised into pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decline in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ atine quot@@ i@@ ent were statisti@@ cally significant compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabetes patients . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while below met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a 20 @-@ week trial , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were random@@ ized into groups that received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ bed , where top concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; interaction studies have demonstrated that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after the oral application of radio@@ active pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was mainly found in the f@@ eces ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma @-@ elimination time of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ite is 16 @-@ 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral clearing of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies observed in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys according to repeated administration plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ trophy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces insulin resistance resulting in the gest@@ ation resulting in increased insulin resistance of the mat@@ ernal animal and thus dimin@@ ishes the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( for male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) were induced by the ur@@ inary bladder .
&quot; in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ ds led to an increased frequency of colon@@ iz@@ um@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white until white , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence amounted to 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures experienced in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ision medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study for two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in each with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d were investigated . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decline in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ atine quot@@ i@@ ent were statisti@@ cally significant compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a 20 @-@ week trial , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the nas@@ al tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both on the effect on the gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to effectively use insulin . &quot;
&quot; the study measured the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane introduced a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , indicating that the blood sugar levels were similarly sharply reduced as with another human insulin . &quot;
acet@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ aph@@ ane may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is to be taken from the package insert ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ aph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice daily , when a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
the injection needle must be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly , for example , by intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , can perceive the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia major warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phase , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin analog or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin or animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required for the patient to change to the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emic reactions occurred after a transition from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different than in previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; travelling across several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor must consider possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines they have taken . &quot;

&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration amounts to up to 24 hours . &quot;
the res@@ or@@ ption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .

&quot; this means that approximately half an hour after you have applied it , your blood sugar begins to sink and that the effect will stop about 24 hours . &quot;
&quot; if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to this insulin product , met@@ ac@@ res@@ ol or any of the other components ( see section 7 More information ) . &quot;
watch out for the below 5 Which Side Effects are Pos@@ sible ? described Sympt@@ oms of All@@ ergy when you feel first signs of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( symptoms of a reduction ) .
&quot; if your doctor has caused a change from an insulin type or brand to another , you may need to adjust the dose by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; ► Check the label , whether it is the right insulin type , dis@@ inf@@ ect the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ amp@@ on . &quot;
&quot; if this is not completely uns@@ atis@@ fied , when you get the pier@@ cing bottle , enter the pier@@ cing bottle to your pharmacy , if it has not been kept properly or frozen ( see 6 How is Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane stored ? ) ► if it is not even white and cloudy after the res@@ us@@ sing . &quot;
use the injection technique that your doctor or your diab@@ etic consultant has recommended . leave the injection needle for at least 6 seconds under your skin to ensure that the full dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; warning signs of a reduction can suddenly occur and may be : cold sweat , cold blowing , head@@ ache , heart rate , nau@@ sea , severe hunger , transi@@ tions , unusual fatigue and weakness , nerv@@ ousness or trem@@ ors , anxiety , confusion , concentration difficulties . &quot;
&quot; tell your relatives , friends and close colleagues that they will bring you into the stable side situation in case of un@@ consciousness and immediately notify your doctor . &quot;
&quot; ► If a severe reduction is not treated , this may lead to ( temporary or permanent ) brain damage or even death . &quot;
you can reg@@ ain consciousness quicker if the hormone Glu@@ c@@ agon is inj@@ ected by a person familiar with the gift .
this can happen : • If you have too much insulin inj@@ ections - if you eat too little or leave a meal - if you do more than otherwise physically .
&quot; increased ur@@ ination , thirst , loss of appetite , nau@@ sea or vom@@ iting , ligh@@ the@@ aded skin , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness and fruity ( after acet@@ one ) sm@@ elling breath . &quot;
• You have forgotten an injection • repeated injection of less insulin than you need • an infection or fever • more food than usual • less physical exercise than usual .
&quot; if you too often give an injection in the same place , the sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue may shrink ( Li@@ pat@@ rop@@ hies ) or increase ( lip @-@ oh@@ y@@ per@@ trop@@ hies ) . &quot;
&quot; if you notice deep@@ enings or thick@@ ening of your skin at the injection site , tell your doctor or your diab@@ etic consultant , because these reactions can wor@@ sen or affect the absorption of your insulin if you inj@@ ected into such a place . &quot;
&quot; immediately consult a doctor if symptoms of allergy are spread to other parts of the body , or if you suddenly feel uncomfortable and you feel di@@ zzy or have the impression to become un@@ conscious . &quot;
you may have a very rare severe allergic reaction to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane or one of its constitu@@ ents ( a so @-@ called systemic allergic reaction ) .
&quot; if any of the side effects you are experiencing are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice any side effects that are not specified in this use information , please inform your doctor about your diab@@ et@@ es@@ the@@ ater@@ in or your pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
what Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane 30 contains - The active ingredient is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology produced insulin human ( 30 % as a soluble insulin and 70 % as is@@ oph@@ ane @-@ insulin ) .
&quot; as Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane looks and contents of the pack The Inj@@ ection suspension is supplied as a d@@ ull , white , aqu@@ eous suspension in packs of 1 or 5 hole @-@ bottles of 10 ml each . &quot;
use the injection technique that your doctor or your diab@@ etic consultant has recommended . leave the injection needle for at least 6 seconds under your skin to ensure that the full dose was inj@@ ected .
it is recommended - after it has been taken out of the refrigerator - to increase the temperature of the pier@@ cing bottle to room temperature before the insulin is res@@ us@@ ed@@ to the first use according to the operating instructions .
&quot; as Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane looks and contents of the pack The Inj@@ ection suspension is supplied as a d@@ ull , white , aqu@@ eous suspension in packs of 1 or 5 hole @-@ bottles of 10 ml each . &quot;
&quot; ► Check on the label , whether it is the correct insulin type . always check the pen@@ fill cartridge , including the rubber sheet ( stop@@ pers ) . &quot;
do not use them if any damage is visible or a gap between the rubber bul@@ b and the white tape of the label is visible .
&quot; for more information , refer to the manual of your insulin inj@@ ections system . ► Dis@@ inf@@ ect the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ amp@@ on . ► Use a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . &quot;
&quot; ► In insulin @-@ inf@@ usion pumps , when the Pen@@ fill or the device that contains the fill , dropped , damaged or broken , there is the risk of running insulin , if it has not been kept properly or frozen ( see 6 How is Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane retained ? ) ► if it is not even white and cloudy after the res@@ us@@ sing . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the quantity of the rapidly acting insulin must first be raised , then the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required for the patient to change to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; travelling across several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;

this can happen : • If you have too much insulin inj@@ ections - if you eat too little or leave a meal - if you do more than otherwise physically
always set the closing lid of your Nov@@ o@@ Let &apos;s pens when it is not in use to protect it from light .
• Dis@@ inf@@ ect the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ acker • Use a new injection needle for each injection • Use the protective needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Figure A ) • Dra@@ g the large external cap of the injection needle and the internal cap of the injection needle .
proceed as follows to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle top • kno@@ ck a few times with your finger lightly against the cartridge .
&quot; when air bub@@ bles are present , they will accum@@ ulate in the cartridge at the top of the cartridge • Wh@@ ile you continue the injection needle , turn the cartridge at a click into the direction of the arrow ( Figure B ) • Wh@@ ile the injection needle is still pointing upwards , push the pressure button to the top ( figure C ) • Now spr@@ inkle a drop of insulin from the tip of the injection needle . &quot;
&quot; put the cap onto the pen again , that the digit is 0 compared to the dosing stamp ( Figure D ) • Check@@ out if the pressure button is pressed completely . &quot;
&quot; if the pressure knob cannot move freely , insulin is pressed from the injection needle • The scale on the closing lid shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units . &quot;
&quot; the push button moves outw@@ ards while you turn the closing lid • The scale below the pressure button ( push button scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot;
&quot; 107 • For the highest number you can see on the push button scale • Don &apos;t lean on the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have adjusted a wrong dose , turn the closing lid forward or backward until you have set the right number of units . &quot;
&quot; turn it down until the pressure button is at the bottom and you will feel a resistance , then put the cap off and put it up so again that the 0 of the met@@ ering stamp is over . &quot;
make sure to press the pressure button only during the injection • Ke@@ ep down the pressure button after injection until the injection needle was pulled out of the skin .
&quot; it may be incorrect • You can &apos;t set a dose higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you can &apos;t use them to adjust your dose or select . &quot;

&quot; the dose can be corrected both upwards and down by turning the dose pres@@ elec@@ tor knob into the appropriate direction , until the correct dose is facing the dose of the dose rate . &quot;
&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already exhibit signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ ural notes ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. greater ur@@ ate cryst@@ alli@@ zation which can lead to artic@@ ular and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first months of treatment , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients should use Aden@@ ur@@ ic for at least six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic . &quot;
the drug is not recommended in children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary acid levels were below 6 mg / dl for the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients received a dose of 80 mg once a day , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who once daily intake 120 mg , in the last three measurements , a ur@@ inary acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nau@@ sea , skin r@@ ash , and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to urine drainage ( including one from the patient &apos;s history known or currently present or current bon@@ ded no@@ des and / or a poly@@ arthritis ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ment bar still amounts to &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; for patients with severe kidney function limits , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
children and you@@ ths Since there is no experience in children and adolescents the application of Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
&quot; since organ transplan@@ t recipients have no experience in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at will not be recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ emic heart disease or un@@ compens@@ ated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , treatment is not recommended with Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ eic acid drugs , it can occur during the treatment beginning to acute toxic@@ ity because by lowering the ser@@ um urine acid level , ur@@ ic acid deposits can first be mobil@@ ised in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; for example in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a de@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during the Phase 3 clinical trials , mild ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with February ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to carry out a liver function test prior to the beginning of the Feb@@ ur@@ ary Treatment and in the subsequent course depending on clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ war no in@@ effective studies were carried out at Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or may lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( an in@@ hibition of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line metabolism was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; test subjects were associated with the simultaneous application of Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times a day with a rise in February stat@@ or ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ chic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ chic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dosage adjustment for Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at or the simultaneously used other substance .
&quot; in a study with volunteers 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily studied a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at based on the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous sei@@ z@@ ure containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , the absorption of Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) delayed and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies may not include side effects of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1,3 versus 0,3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 to 0.7 events per 100 patient @-@ years ) , a numer@@ ically higher incidence was observed in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient @-@ years ) , although no statistical significant differences could be detected and no caus@@ al connection with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors determined in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects which have been reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at and which have been reported in all Feb@@ ur@@ at treatment groups more than once reported are listed below . &quot;
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated at the same time with Col@@ chic@@ ine . * * In clinical trials , no serious r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 90@@ 6 patients received up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients received up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the adverse events reported during the long @-@ term compar@@ ability studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ ur@@ ary treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patients ) , according to indications . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ ot@@ thesia , con@@ spic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh , short@@ ness of skin ren@@ al , erectile dysfunction , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te concentration in the blood , decrease of the number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decrease of the number of white blood cells . &quot;
the effect of ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the pur@@ in@@ consistency in humans and arises in the context of the reaction cas@@ c@@ ade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is a powerful , non @-@ pur@@ ine @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro inhibit@@ ing that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
&quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients receiving the last three month specific ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ment bar &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10@@ mg ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cancer in@@ in@@ ine to study start of &gt; 1,5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the usual dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um cancer rates &gt; 1,5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summ@@ arized for analysis . * p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
&quot; the lowering of the ser@@ um urine acid level to &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the medical visit in week 2 and sustained long @-@ term over the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cancer rates &gt; 1,5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function limits The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney function limits ( d. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decline of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of ser@@ um urine acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ ural attacks ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a fo@@ d@@ dle ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the magnitude of the no@@ d@@ ules , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the no@@ d@@ ules up to the month 24 . &quot;
elevated T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ ie / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and in patients who received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ X ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at increased from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
doses between 120 mg and 300 mg are observed for Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C that is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ MA@@ X amounts approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentrations was observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; plasma proteins from Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9,@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies with human liver micro@@ som@@ s , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are predominantly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is produced mainly by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked February , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine of an un@@ modified Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gates ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion via urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as un@@ modified Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gates ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; specific patient groups kidney failure after taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ X of Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the average total AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at decreased by approximately the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh classification B ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) , the C@@ MA@@ X and AU@@ C of Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites were not significantly changed compared to subjects with normal liver function . &quot;
age There were no significant changes with regard to AU@@ C of Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ours ( temporary cell cap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , at about the 11 @-@ fold of exposure in humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of specific purpose @-@ specific cri@@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was noted that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in case of high doses , which were about 3 times the human therapeutic exposure occurred , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occ@@ ured , which was accompanied by a reduction in the delay capacity and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;

&quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients receiving the last three month specific ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ment bar &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of ser@@ um urine acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ ural attacks ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a fo@@ d@@ dle ) . &quot;

&quot; the owner of the license for the transport has to make sure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application is ready before the medicine is brought into circulation , and as long as the drug is brought into circulation . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine , an updated R@@ MP can be submitted to risk management systems for human medicine with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available , which have an impact on the safety data , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk management activities • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ isation ) • on request of the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration down by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the cryst@@ alli@@ zation is prevented and in this way a reduction of the dis@@ comfort is achieved . &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC should not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at or any of the other ingredients of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
&quot; tell your doctor before you start taking this medicine if you have a heart weakness or suffer or suffer from another heart problem . • If you suffer from a high ur@@ inary acid concentration in a row of cancer or Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han @-@ Syn@@ dro@@ ms ( a rare con@@ genital disorder , where too much ur@@ ic acid in the blood ) is treated . &quot;
&quot; if at the moment you have a stroke ( sudden occur@@ ence of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , red@@ ness , heat feeling and joint swelling ) , wait until the cra@@ y@@ oning is cl@@ ung before you begin treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be the case with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first treatment weeks or - months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be you other medicines if necessary to prevent arthritis or treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are using / / or used or used other medicines , even if it is not prescription . &quot;
&quot; it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking medicine , as interactions with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may occur and your doctor may possibly have to consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ cap@@ top@@ ur@@ ine ( for the treatment of asthma ) • The@@ ophy@@ l@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood th@@ inning in heart disease ) &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of a low vitamin D level . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data that come from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D level .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the percentage of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also stipul@@ ates that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dose , contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , corresponds exactly to the dose required for preventing bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ her@@ nia ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , tap@@ ered abdom@@ en ( infl@@ amed belly ) , as well as aci@@ dic kno@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 , or any other ingredient , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in cases of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , beverage or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
following indications are to follow closely to reduce the risk of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water after the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or melt the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
&quot; pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ c@@ ers , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , are given only with special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required a hospital brief@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be noted in case of symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and seek medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or , after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was detected , rare ( after market introduction ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ onic rose of the jaw , commonly associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy is predominantly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available , indicating whether the risk of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a lower surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted to use the dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet in the next morning after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at have no indication of directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
oste@@ onic rose of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports come from cancer patients but has also been reported for oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
&quot; however , ser@@ um @-@ cal@@ ci@@ ums increased up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; with an oral over@@ dose Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , Hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ ate , and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract like stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , gast@@ ri@@ tis or Ul@@ zer@@ a can occur . &quot;
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the conversion of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ cholester@@ to Vitamin D3 .
&quot; the main effect of 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ amin D3 is the increase in the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as regul@@ ating ser@@ um calcium , ren@@ al secre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a deficiency of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ m , hyp@@ ophy@@ cos@@ at@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al muscle and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ y can lead to a higher risk of falls and frac@@ tures for oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals . &quot;

after 15 @-@ week treatment the mean ser@@ um levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) as in the group under Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) lowered the percentage of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency after 15 weeks ( ser@@ um value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lic acids D &lt; 3@@ 7.5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at alone ( 12 % vs .
studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at The therapeutic equ@@ ency of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study on post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in phase III studies the mean asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day amounted to 8.8 % at the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur h@@ als and 7.8 % at the con@@ tender . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 3.2 % compared to placebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more ver@@ teb@@ rate frac@@ tures . &quot;
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of ver@@ teb@@ ral and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to continue ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur neck and the entire body was maintained .
&quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. a day , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily administration of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least one new spine by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption , based on an intraven@@ ous reference dose , mean the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate for women 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after a no@@ c@@ turn@@ al fasting and two hours before the intake of a standardis@@ ed breakfast . &quot;
bio@@ availability increased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken half an hour before a standardis@@ ed breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day . &quot;
in healthy subjects the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 distribution studies on rats have shown that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly re@@ distri@@ butes to the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion After the intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate about 50 % of the radio@@ actively selected substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the com@@ partments .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clearance was not 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; the mean maximum concentration in ser@@ um ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D3 was 5,@@ 9 ng / ml and the medi@@ an period up to the maximum level of ser@@ um concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in the liver , biot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation vitamin D3 is quickly hydro@@ xy@@ ated in the liver and then metabol@@ ised in the kidney to 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ lic D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form . &quot;
&quot; separation of radio@@ active mark@@ ed vitamin D3 in healthy subjects was the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours 2.4 % , in the com@@ partments after 4 days 4.9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical trials have shown that the share of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although there are no clinical data about it , it is nevertheless expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at such as in animal experiments can also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in bone is expected in patients with reduced kidney function ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at non @-@ clinical data based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , chronic toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential do not reveal any particular haz@@ ards for the human being . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is administered by adult patients , who have been transplan@@ ted to kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously conducted trials with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft , as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , while Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f &apos;s application was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients , in which the gra@@ ft was gra@@ ded after one year after a treatment ( by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , shorter further studies were carried out in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and studied how Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f may not be used . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines can be taken simultaneously with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , as the Adv@@ ag@@ raph does , or the dose of the medication taken at the same time , must be adjusted accordingly . &quot;

only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; alter@@ ations of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close scrut@@ iny of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a transition to an alternative formulation , therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood flow regulations ( see below recommendations )
&quot; after change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after change@@ over . &quot;
&quot; on day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable with both formul@@ as both at kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation using Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ gra@@ ft transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral intake of medicines , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the preparation of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application For suppression of the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
further dose adjustments can be required later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabil@@ isation after transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ raph 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the total daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a transition from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once a day the treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ t must start for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection .
&quot; heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ raph , an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients Al@@ though there is no clinical experience with advanced pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal cancer patients in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 0.10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , for transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dose adjustment in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood vessels in the targeted area may require a lowering of the dose in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , careful observation of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular appointment of the ser@@ um carcin@@ omas , calcul@@ ating the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
transition from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f In the transition from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ to to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; the dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases , with the aid of whole blood tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low levels . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform common controls of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ tal@@ low levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after changing pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , dose adjustment , modifications of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or con@@ current use of substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adap@@ tations of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred . &quot;
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level of blood in the blood is 20 ng / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in patients - and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy for liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; alter@@ ations of the formulation or the regime should only be undertaken under the close scrut@@ iny of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 To treat adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have proven to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agents , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formula Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recep@@ tors in childhood , there are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions which may lead to lowering the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and weak@@ ening the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the St. John Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , is to be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is offered , as the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tum @-@ hyper@@ trophy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infection , liquid over@@ exposure and est@@ rogen . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agents , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothes or use of a s@@ uns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision disorders , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose included , is recommended in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary g@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption special care . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , and consequently increase or lower the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels with simultaneous administration of substances that can alter the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain consistent concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was performed with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly resulted from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the in@@ hibition of the gastro@@ intestinal im@@ plantation . &quot;
&quot; highly @-@ dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us effect on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Hem@@ mer ; therefore , the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed with drugs that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; because tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormon@@ al exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious when decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are taken . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially reduces the clear@@ ence of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a low number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that in comparison with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure a surveillance of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) .
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression can often not be determined precisely because of the under@@ under@@ ing of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , patients who are treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are often increased suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infection ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot;
&quot; cases of N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ associated progressive leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
it has been reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
mechanisms of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level are likely to medi@@ ated the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ lic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular tissues .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhi@@ bit of signal trans@@ duction in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a specific range of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , also the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;

&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the form of pro@@ gra@@ f used twice daily after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ ts . &quot;

&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients who have been converted from tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection , was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a multic@@ entr@@ e study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed in 205 patients who , at the same time , under@@ went a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ised procedure tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) . &quot;
the oral initi@@ al@@ dosage ( by protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the desired level levels from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal transplan@@ ts showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , leading to low levels of transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) . &quot;
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance @-@ R@@ ats observed after transplan@@ tation .
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via bile . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients prescribed by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the total daily dose , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform common controls of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;

advoc@@ ates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a deficiency of factor VIII related to inn@@ ate blood cl@@ ots ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application are directed to whether advoc@@ ates are used to treat bleeding or prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII short@@ fall , causing blood cl@@ utter problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been produced , which makes it possible for the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another drug approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , among them a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ance in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new anti@@ sep@@ is@@ odes with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies compared to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ates may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , m@@ aus@@ age or witch protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of advances in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ deficiency , according to the location and extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII should not fall below the given plas@@ m@@ asp@@ iegel ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
inj@@ ecting every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute depression are removed .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
&quot; during the treatment course , it is recommended to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections an appropriate determination of the factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII , differ@@ ing in vi@@ vo recovery and show different half @-@ value periods . &quot;
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activity is not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the Factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the rate of administration should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; for pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure times and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ or development , after changing from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ ti@@ cking ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , there are no experiences about the application of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ R@@ s , which occur in the largest number of patients , were inhibit@@ ors of factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who had a higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected fall of the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred postoperative ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE inf@@ usion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in plasma and the clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or type ( 2,4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , in none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VIII ex@@ hi@@ bit@@ or was detected after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial were 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors versus Factor VIII .
&quot; the immune response of the patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and an en@@ during peak of anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pren@@ itus , skin r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ us gran@@ u@@ loc@@ y@@ tes was reported in several re@@ peti@@ tive product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ act@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency unknown ) . &quot;
activ@@ ating factor VIII works as a factor of factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed on pre@@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( base value of factor VIII @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ ATE safety profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a PS@@ UR@@ s fil@@ ing every 6 months , decided to apply for a further extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company will withdraw its application for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , the breasts , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues which bind other structures in the body surro@@ unds and support ) are affected . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that has been modified gene@@ tically so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; that has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene that is not broken in the human body , normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and killing cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , where Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer occurred in the abdom@@ en , bones and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had examined the answers of the company to the questions asked him , some questions were still unclear . &quot;
&quot; based on the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP will produce a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that inj@@ ections of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours bring benefits to patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the company has not proved sufficient that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be established in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not notice the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
changing active ingredients means that the tablets are set together to release one of the effective ingredients immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len caused by nas@@ al path@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ ung . &quot;
&quot; a treatment duration of over 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be repeated on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when considering all h@@ ay fever symptoms except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who participated in aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; when only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a decrease of the symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other constitu@@ ents , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active substances or lau@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for treating allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients suffering from con@@ genital glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ) , or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed by the whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing , breaking or ch@@ ew@@ ing ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data concerning safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease during long @-@ term use . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued as mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; since aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within the 2 weeks after the end of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is attribut@@ able to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ conduc@@ tor@@ oids , such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , lis@@ erg@@ oline , hydro@@ chlor@@ amine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy was not checked for this patient collective and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function failure and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed that the treatment must be reli@@ eved when performing hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or strengthening head@@ aches ) . &quot;
&quot; treating the following patient groups is recommended : • Pati@@ ents with digit@@ alis • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ct in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests because anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce their extent .
&quot; in the course of clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were given in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed . &quot;
&quot; the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with placebo , no matter whether it was dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , in vitro studies , it is not inhibit@@ ing that the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug does not inhi@@ bit and is neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , but experiences from a large number of pregn@@ ancies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies do not always be transmitted to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic and ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ ors , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ thal attempts . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ating mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory disorders , di@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , di@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , di@@ zz@@ iness , hyper@@ tension , hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children , just like at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ illary and di@@ lat@@ ation , skin red@@ ness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no impact on standard measurement parameters of the flight sliding , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in recommended dosage can cause other sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , wherein 4@@ 14 patients received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total score for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined on the basis of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in patient sub @-@ groups with regard to gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city . &quot;
&quot; within a single dose study to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes of administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was performed with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ din poor@@ ly di@@ gest@@ ed . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposition ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was equivalent to exposure after application of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity for re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproduction toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine cannot detect any particular haz@@ ards for the human being . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine content . &quot;
in reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ological studies the combination of lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in a dose of up to 150@@ mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in March 2007 , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application &apos;s application is and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , current or it@@ chy nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 In certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ c@@ ous ph@@ ous membrane of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contained in this medicine . &quot;
&quot; ( diabetes ) , a sten@@ osi@@ tive stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer that leads to a nar@@ rowing of the stomach , the small intest@@ ine or the o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us ) , a bladder neck ob@@ struction , bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ ms in the history of sickness ( difficulty of breathing due to a var@@ ic@@ ose of the lung mus@@ cul@@ ature ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with liver , kid@@ neys , or bladder . &quot;
&quot; inform your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur or diagnosed with you under the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • hyper@@ tension • heart ch@@ asing , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • irregular heart@@ beat , head@@ ache or strengthening existing head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription . &quot;
&quot; for use in recommended dosage , it is not possible to assume that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze conduc@@ ts di@@ zz@@ iness or reduces the attention . &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you forget the intake of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , if you forgot to take a dose on time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects you notice is significantly imp@@ aired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this usage information .
&quot; heart ch@@ ase , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , appetite loss , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , head@@ ache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and ligh@@ the@@ aded . &quot;

&quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , it has rarely been reported about cases of serious allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whist@@ ling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin r@@ ashes . &quot;
&quot; cases of heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , abdominal pain , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rho@@ ea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , fatigue syndrome , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 M@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0,5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies on seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; effectiveness has been measured by determining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and the efficiency of the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies were presented to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for intake and the melt tabl@@ etten in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us reduced by 25 to 32 % , compared to decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decline of symptom exac@@ erb@@ ation after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ din or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials for the effectiveness of the use of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine for young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; the treatment of the allergic rhin@@ itis ( occur@@ ren@@ ces of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease progression , and can be resum@@ ed after the symptoms of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rhin@@ itis ( occur@@ ren@@ ces of symptoms at 4 or more days per week , and more than 4 weeks ) , a prolonged treatment can be recommended to the patient during the allergic period . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , intake of alcohol and alcohol did not increase the performance of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that it can occur in very rare cases that may lead to impair@@ ment of traffic and ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us daily than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo reported fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , m@@ outh@@ dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years of age , the most common side effect was head@@ aches . this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and at 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which a compound of up to 20 mg daily was administered over 14 days a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose @-@ dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no impact on standard measurement variables of flight sliding , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can alternatively also be divided into allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week , or less than 4 weeks . &quot;
&quot; per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as a occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the total score for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in the different forms , and chronic patients can be easily rec@@ ited in a simple pro@@ spec@@ tively . &quot;
&quot; as hi@@ stam@@ ine is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ inary disorders , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine also leads to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pren@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in the it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disturb@@ ance of sleep and growth considerably as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients de@@ ographi@@ es were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
there are no indications for a clin@@ ically relevant accumulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely eliminated . &quot;
in @-@ vi@@ vo dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
&quot; in a single dose of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ clinical trials performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ ad@@ adin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , and Lor@@ ad@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine cannot identify any particular haz@@ ards for the human being . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that there are no data available that support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin analyses should play a role . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze and experience a higher substance strain ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years of age , which is restricted to metabolic , is identical to that of children that are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or a su@@ cro@@ se is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years old who were eligible for anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy received a daily non@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ feed of 1.25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults can be extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated in adults to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of up to 20 mg a day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets performed in clinical studies with no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not cause an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess or increase drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adults and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the total score for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively decrease the result caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pren@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restri@@ c@@ tively met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup @-@ formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis that are restricted to met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ value of about 120 hours .
there are no cl@@ ues for clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In different single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ PI values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in pedi@@ atric patients with recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;

clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets a day than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) were used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;

there is limited experience from clinical trials for the effectiveness of the use of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine for young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet is removed without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
overall frequency of adverse events between the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not decrease significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melt @-@ tabl@@ ette proved to be a bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight sliding , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the dis@@ sem@@ ination of this badly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , however , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;

the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; inf@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3,@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) were reported among small children between 6 and 23 months . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine solution for inclusion should not involve any side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
the recommended doses were the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see Section 5.2 ) in children &apos;s and adults population .
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ onally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can alternatively also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis , depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;

&quot; the market launch of A@@ eri@@ us has rarely been reported on cases of serious allergic reactions ( difficulty breathing , whist@@ ling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) and skin r@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us solution for admission is indicated for children aged between 1 and 11 years , teenagers ( 12 years and older ) and adults , older people included . &quot;
&quot; if the solution for inser@@ ting an application @-@ spray for preparations for inclusion with sc@@ aling , you can use it alternatively to take the appropriate amount of solution for taking . &quot;

&quot; however , diar@@ rho@@ ea , fever and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness were frequent in children under 2 years of diar@@ rho@@ ea , fever and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , while in adults fatigue , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness and head@@ ache have been reported more often than with placebo . &quot;

the 150 ml package size is a measuring spoon or an application @-@ sy@@ ringe f@@ û@@ r preparations for inhal@@ ing with scal@@ ings of 2.5 ml and 5 ml cans .
&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. has officially notified the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company takes its application for approval for the transport of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people for protection against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus occurs , which can easily spread from man to person , because people have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus as being &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to make rapid contact with a influ@@ enza virus this stem . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane covering of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as a body foreign ) , is puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study had not been carried out in accordance with &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined the anti@@ viral drugs used by the patient before , and the likel@@ ihood that the virus will respond to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between the ages of four and twelve , and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is calculated according to the body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS cannot cure , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thereby also the development of associated infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without a rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; this drug , which was strengthened with low dos@@ ed ri@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared to 206 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / m@@ L than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase decreased the viral load , however from the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the anti @-@ virus anti @-@ virus medicine increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there was a severe decrease in viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common A@@ gener@@ ase side effects ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , skin r@@ ash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded just like ag@@ ar and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who are taking A@@ gener@@ ase are the risk of a li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( alter@@ ations in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ onic rose ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the immune system re@@ covering ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to out@@ weigh the risks of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee determined that the use of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally admitted under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; given only limited information at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited a permit for the transport of A@@ gener@@ a across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for treating HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
&quot; normally , A@@ generative capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ generative capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not ex@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg of body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ ener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 m@@ g. twice a day . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous treatment should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function , in patients with severe liver function failure , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with pharmaceuticals , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ per@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; normally , A@@ generative capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver con@@ formation with potentially fatal consequences .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant medical information of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients with previously reduced liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , which are metabol@@ ised by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; because the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Hem@@ mer Lov@@ el@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin greatly depends on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ el@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended for the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; in patients who use these drugs at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma gas levels ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is simultaneously given with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ at@@ ental symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl alcohol content of the A@@ generative solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
&quot; many of the patients had other diseases , which were needed for therapy to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ äm@@ oph@@ ile patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis are reported . &quot;
&quot; at the time when an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although multi@@ fac@@ torial eth@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body @-@ Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ onic rose in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) were reported . &quot;
&quot; CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with pharmaceuticals , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metabol@@ ised by CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and for increased plasma gas with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in trying to balance the reduced plasma bar by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects were observed in the liver . &quot;
Johannis@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ atal mirror and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
&quot; 508 % increased , by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment regim@@ en . &quot;
52 % decreases if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed surveillance is recommended , since the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is unknown . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with diar@@ rhe@@ a in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended for at least one hour due to the sac@@ ros@@ ine component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dosage adjustment is required . &quot;
treatment with b@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be lower .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and available limited data suggest that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine may reduce the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advisable since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plastic bar . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available for this . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out but the levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may , if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , may lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as as@@ per@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ va , known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase the plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturb@@ ances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the end@@ ogen@@ ous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ co@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids unless the potential benefits of treatment prev@@ ails the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ el@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose constitu@@ ency is highly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced enh@@ ancements of plasma gas should be expected at the same time administered by A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plasma @-@ level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations can be recommended to stabili@@ ze the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased while simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be increased ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with l@@ itt@@ l@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while using par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in plasma gas from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ at@@ ental symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can at present be given , such as the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ rin dosage , if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended for the possibility of atten@@ uation or strengthening of an@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are also recommended . &quot;
careful observation of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous application of as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a re@@ production study involving pregnant rats , administered by the ni@@ dation in the uter@@ us until the end of lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the seed , including fertility and reproduction , was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , appeared early and rarely led to treatment abor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) which were assessed by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed at more than 1 % of the patients but also under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and cereb@@ ral fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ trophy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cr@@ us@@ tial fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; among 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally non @-@ pre@@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ din / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din for a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( sti@@ ern@@ ing ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r treated 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 patients ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontane@@ ously within two weeks , without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with PI pre@@ treated patients , which received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , were similar to those observed in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is aware of signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) , if necessary , are necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;

&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhi@@ bited concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the area of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M at ak@@ ut infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the relationship between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ ossi@@ an pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , unlike other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regim@@ ens were observed with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described rarely were observed . &quot;
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally non @-@ pre@@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ate gen@@ otyp@@ ically could be investigated . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates from 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 included patients , showed resistant samples that were similar to those in adults . &quot;

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors performed for 96 weeks following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or insul@@ ators .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a stri@@ ped phen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance to a virus spr@@ inkl@@ er and a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretations based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or insul@@ ators .
firms that market diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ders ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ ars , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally non @-@ pre@@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( one of them referred to a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; early abor@@ tion of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits , which can affect subsequent treatment . &quot;
&quot; evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which AC@@ PI pre@@ treated adults ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ os@@ osi@@ dan@@ ish@@ a ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with lower @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and thre@@ ef@@ old ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the part study A by PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared with the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the virus load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ suffici@@ ency threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
evidence of the efficacy of un@@ ble@@ ached A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 was treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies A@@ generative oxid@@ ation was used three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; no low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) , together with A@@ gener@@ ase @-@ administered N@@ R@@ TI@@ s . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , therapy optimisation should be taken into consideration in case of therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; according to oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) amounts to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) was imp@@ acted by the intake of food , although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be attached to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , will probably remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss up to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore medicines , which indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit or become a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administered with caution when given at the same time with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , results in a similar daily am@@ on@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ generative oxid@@ ation and A@@ generative capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
&quot; the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these regim@@ ens are comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r of mice and rats , hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas on dos@@ ages occ@@ uring to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , were correspon@@ ded . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; however , there is little evidence of the clinical relevance of this findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in vitro and in vitro gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ ation test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes were neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase or after the treatment . &quot;
studies on the toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control rooms and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in a systemic exposure of plasma that was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development . &quot;
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ kl@@ ets ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg of body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; con@@ current use should be treated with caution in patients with weak or light liver function failure , in patients with severe liver function failure , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed surveillance is recommended , since the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is unknown . &quot;
treatment with b@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be lower .
&quot; if these medicines are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available for this . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the end@@ ogen@@ ous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended for the possibility of atten@@ uation or strengthening of an@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , a re@@ production study involving pregnant rats , administered by the ni@@ dation in the uter@@ us until the end of breast@@ feeding , showed a reduced increase in body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is aware of signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) , if necessary , are necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhi@@ bited concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the area of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M at acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , therapy optimisation should be taken into consideration in case of therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss up to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore medicines , which indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit or become a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administered with caution when given at the same time with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r of mice and rats , hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas on dos@@ ages occurred during dos@@ ages which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure in humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; however , there is little evidence of the clinical relevance of this findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications . &quot;

studies on the toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control rooms and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the metabolism path@@ ways are not yet fully developed , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for treating HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years are indicated . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; B@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ generative solution for inclusion has not been covered with PI pre@@ treated patients with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ generative capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not ex@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to stop ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generative oxid@@ ation is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since there is no dosage recommendation for simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ generative oxid@@ ation is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl glass content , A@@ generative oxid@@ ation is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ per@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of being transferred from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ äm@@ oph@@ ile patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis are reported . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase the plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturb@@ ances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data to 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inscription inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am plasma concentrations were significantly higher after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake may not be used due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained prop@@ yl @-@ gly@@ col during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , a re@@ production study involving pregnant rats , administered by the ni@@ dation in the uter@@ us until the end of breast@@ feeding , showed a reduced increase of 55 body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ ossi@@ an pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , unlike other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regim@@ ens were observed with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described rarely were observed . &quot;

&quot; • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is five times a week during one or two weeks of treatment . • For acute ker@@ at@@ osis , it is possible to apply six weeks a week during one or two weeks of treatment , with four weeks of inter@@ ruption between treatment cycles , three times a week . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is dil@@ uted to the affected areas of the skin , so that they remain sufficiently long ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before they are washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a , or placebo , either daily or five times a week . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . &quot;
the most common adverse reactions of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyp@@ not@@ ic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ osis ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults when the size or number of les@@ ions limit the effectiveness and / or acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to continue as long until all visible f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces disappeared in the genital or peripher@@ y area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the procedure described above should be considered if intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream once he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; im@@ pregn@@ ate I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and in the puri@@ fied , with f@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen infected skin area , until the cream is completely drawn . &quot;
there should be a weighing between the benefit of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a weighing between the benefit of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mo@@ sis and a case were observed with circumc@@ ision leading stri@@ k@@ tur . &quot;
&quot; when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have also been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have led to temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; to apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous inj@@ ected substances for the treatment of external fo@@ d@@ les@@ ions in the genital and peripher@@ y , there are no clinical experiences so far . &quot;
&quot; limited data suggests an increased rate of slope reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , nose , lips , or hair attachment was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s dis@@ comfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made for several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ fi@@ denti@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs no clinical experiences are available , therefore the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial point out that large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower probability of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not investigated for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the Li@@ ppen@@ rot . &quot;
only very limited data can be found on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on arms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this purpose , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually take off in the course of the therapy in intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if local skin reactions cause major dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 acu@@ ity les@@ ions revealed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither to one @-@ time nor after multiple top@@ ical application quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were achieved , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most frequently shared and as likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related side effects in the studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions in the treatment of F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effects include complaints at the application site with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
the Bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III were shown below .
&quot; the most common , as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the context , were a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) in these studies . &quot;
adverse events identified by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème are listed below .
&quot; these placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream often lead to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ k@@ ori@@ ation / precip@@ itation / precip@@ itation ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the clinical signs intended , the clinical signs indicate that in these trials it was very common with severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe atro@@ phy and cal@@ ci@@ fication ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials to investigate the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; acci@@ dental single oral recording of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 sach@@ ets , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 m@@ g. consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ine was clearly superior to placebo treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
&quot; at 60 % of patients with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients , the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen patients healed completely ; this was 20 % of the patients with placebo treated patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
full healing could be reached at 23 % of 157 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI :
&quot; the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five @-@ time use per week for 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ological confirmed individual primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ cal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acu@@ ity within a coher@@ ent 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show patients with clin@@ ically healing after one or two periods of treatment a recur@@ ren@@ ces rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the approved indications of external F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen , Ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and Super@@ fi@@ denti@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma typically do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and therefore have not been studied . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages analysed there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more ) .
a minimal systemic recording of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest concentrations in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and was 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 disposable ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
&quot; the calculated half @-@ life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ value after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study , pointing to an extended retention of the drug in the skin . &quot;
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ fic bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG reduced to significantly reduced body weight and increased l@@ actic weight ; a study carried out four months for der@@ mal application showed no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice in case of nar@@ rowing on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ able , there is a risk for man due to systemic exposure to be considered very low . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ours occurred in the group of mice treated with the active cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with small U@@ VR . &quot;

&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged li@@ vers , stiff joints , which make movements difficult , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be administered in a hospital or clinic with revi@@ vals , and patients may need appropriate medicines before the administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study was mainly focused on the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse reactions of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , stomach pain , ar@@ thro@@ path@@ y ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion station . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of the lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review every year any new information that may be known , and if necessary update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will be patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with regard to the reactions to the inf@@ usion and development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B@@ V a permit for the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by means of re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
&quot; the initial inf@@ usion detection rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , increases every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been identified , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment , in which rein@@ vigor@@ ating facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical Phase 3 study , almost all Ig@@ G antibodies form antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be handled with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as little experience with regard to the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically elevated risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions , it must be cau@@ tious after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; 60 minutes before the start of the inf@@ usion with medication ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) , to minimize the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions . &quot;
&quot; in the case of mild or moderate inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reducing the inf@@ usion rate to half the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought down , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the inf@@ usion rate of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of the inf@@ usion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion detection rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not at the same time be used with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is possible . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended to do not breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
adverse events in clinical studies were mainly classified as inf@@ usion @-@ related responses that were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following chart : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , severe reactions including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug interactions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with predominantly severe form of treatment and a treatment duration up to 12 months , reported in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 e / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
most patients came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ve@@ al within 3 months after the treatment was started in the age of 5 years ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
&quot; until the end of the phase 3 study ( or until a premature departure from the study ) , there were no demonstr@@ able antibodies in 13 / 45 patients ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay , among them 3 patients , in which it never came to ser@@ o@@ con@@ formance . &quot;
&quot; patients with absent to low antibody levels showed a robust decline in the urine of G@@ AG in urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ des a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic larv@@ ae activity in vitro which did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies seemed not to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even though the appearance of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the treatment of enzymes is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzyme activity .
&quot; after IV inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ sis , most likely via Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walking test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to perform in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly , 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size by the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation among patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant changes for five eff@@ ectivity variable ( as expected percentage measurement range , range of motion of shoulder joint AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally observed in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the severe form and 4 with the middle course form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dose was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased g@@ ag@@ - mirror in the urine in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a normal mental development rate ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) showed a normal mental development rate ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle circul@@ atory form showed a normal mental development rate , whereas in the older patients with severe failure form there were limited or even no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a Phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage regim@@ ens were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 e / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , but is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regim@@ ens is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those affected by older and less affected patients .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift and reproduction toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot identify any particular haz@@ ards for the human being . &quot;

&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which divi@@ des certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , is either in small quantities before or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if there has occurred a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines Please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because a possible risk of a decreased effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me consists . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to be easily spread to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; in patients who have not previously been treated , A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and patients who have previously received other chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic agent &quot; ( drugs against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluids ) should be given . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood type changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed , or decreases the dose . &quot;
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed thus s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to share .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of action in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ osis , A@@ lim@@ a was studied in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , A@@ lim@@ ta was compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study on 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.4 months in the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time of A@@ lim@@ ta 8.@@ 3 months compared to doc@@ et@@ axel with 7.9 months .
&quot; however , in both studies patients , in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells , showed longer survival times when administered A@@ lim@@ ta than with the comparable medication . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; each pier@@ cing bottle has to be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection @-@ solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary wick sis is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.6 ) .
&quot; in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin , ALI@@ M@@ TA is indicated for first @-@ line therapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ - , advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - inf@@ usion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid should be given the day before and on the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ b , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and intake must be continued throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an intr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed dose and after each third reference cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood image should be created before each gift , including differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a plat@@ el@@ et count . &quot;
&quot; the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking the account of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood sample or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predicted therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which can be applied to ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC grade 2 bleeding .
&quot; if patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient receives the value before the treatment &quot;
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA should be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 doses of doses the here@@ tical toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of 3 or 4 occurs or - continued at the incidence of 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or more compared to patients at age 65 years there is an increased risk of side effects .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not required dose adjustment , which exceed the dose adjustment recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - Level and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) are not specifically studied in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row suppression and can not be administered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality number once again reaches a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et number once again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ us numbers , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous courses of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was noticed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must be used to apply fol@@ ate acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ l@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 - 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ ics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) for at least 2 days before the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for whom a therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed is fores@@ een , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of the therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients , in which these events occurred , had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed treatment is to be considered . &quot;
&quot; 5 main car@@ dio @-@ vascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical studies with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed occasionally if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vacc@@ ines ( except Yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity of the reproductive capacity is p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised in front of the treat@@ - G@@ inn to obtain advice on the conservation of the sperm . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid ( ≥ 1,3 g. a day ) lead to decreased ph@@ em@@ ph@@ ac@@ chari@@ de ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
caution is recommended if in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are used in high doses .
&quot; ( I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ - acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data in terms of interaction potenti@@ als with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long sem@@ it@@ em@@ ics such as Pi@@ ro@@ x@@ ox@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;

ALI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate that breaks down its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting important fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
&quot; in vitro studies showed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed acts as anti@@ tor@@ at with several targets by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ logical reduc@@ t@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and gly@@ c@@ amide ri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes in the de nov@@ o bi@@ os@@ yn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and pur@@ g@@ ic@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ ides . &quot;
&quot; EMP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , easy @-@ blind Phase 3 study of ALI@@ M@@ TA plus cis@@ pl@@ atin at chem@@ on@@ aic patients with mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma showed that with ALI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin , patients treated a clin@@ ically important benefit to those patients who were only covered with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received investig@@ ational medicine ( random@@ ized and treated ) in the treatment arm .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was shown in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared with the sole cis@@ pl@@ a- tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving lung function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in control .
&quot; a multic@@ entr@@ e , random@@ ised , open phase III study with ALI@@ M@@ TA for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC resulted in a medi@@ an survival time of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival occurred in favor of ALI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plat@@ el@@ epi@@ th@@ eli@@ al hist@@ ology ( n = 172 , 6.2 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data of a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ axel .
efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with IT@@ T Population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of ALI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in combination with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; mean P@@ FS was 4.8 months for the combination ALI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin compared to 5.1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC history on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = int@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the overall population a Statisti@@ cal significant for non @-@ inf@@ ancy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ suffici@@ ency limit of 1,17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin needed fewer trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fusion ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;

pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist were studied at 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tum@@ ors in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in inf@@ usion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in urine and 70 % to 90 % of the given dose will be found in the urine within 24 hours of application .
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 m@@ l. / min , and half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al fun@@ tion ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) . &quot;

&quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there is not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ b@@ ated , no adaptation of the dosage is necessary for elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• Pre@@ mature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • Ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ fat single meal or fat @-@ fat diet .
&quot; because weight reduction is associated with diabetes with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist prior to treatment with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diab@@ etic needs to be adapted . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or high cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines needs to be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional pregnancy prevention measures , in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in the case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study on interactions between drugs and in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma was observed . &quot;
&quot; when using War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta @-@ carot@@ ene in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the application of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a minor decrease in A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal disorders and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of the reported side effects noted after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can cause anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
&quot; single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and over@@ weight subjects , without significant clinical findings occ@@ ured . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of cases reported on the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosage , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid re@@ formation of several systemic effects can be attributed to the properties of or@@ list@@ at properties . &quot;
the therapeutic effect sets in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by kov@@ al@@ ent bon@@ ding to the active ser@@ oton@@ in @-@ rest of ga@@ str@@ y- and pancre@@ atic lip@@ ases .
&quot; clinical trials have been derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , high @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
mean change in Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3,30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; during waist measurement , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be found spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of accumulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients , which the minimal system@@ ically res@@ or@@ b@@ ated dose was given , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after sec@@ ession of the N @-@ forming leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified that exhibited approximately 42 % of total plastic surgery . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in re@@ peti@@ tive administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity and reproduction toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot be identified any particular threat to humans . &quot;

oral contrac@@ eption and all@@ i • The effect of oral @-@ increasing means of contrac@@ eption ( pill ) may be weak@@ ened or lifted if you have strong diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) .
&quot; before taking allergy to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking : • A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one to treat cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia . • A@@ carb@@ ine for the treatment of diabetes . &quot;
&quot; ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take drugs and if you take drugs against high blood pressure , you may need to adjust the dosage . &quot;
&quot; for information on the blue pages in section 6 , you can find out more helpful information on how to set your cal@@ orie and fet@@ al boundaries . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a meal or a meal contains no fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal containing too much fat , you risk diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms ( see paragraph 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to the new eating habits , begin before the first capsule intake with a cal@@ orie and fat reduction diet . &quot;
&quot; nutrition books are effective as you can easily understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier for you to change your dietary habits . &quot;
&quot; to ensure your target weight safe , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
• Even eat fatty acids in order to reduce the likel@@ ihood of mal@@ nutrition related effects ( see section 4 ) . • Tr@@ y to move more before you begin taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor in advance if you are not accustomed to physical activity .
&quot; • all@@ i must not be taken for more than 6 months . • If after twelve weeks of use of all@@ i no reduction in your weight , please ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot;
&quot; • For a successful weight loss , it is not about setting up the diet just at short notice and then return to the old habits . &quot;
&quot; • If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule after . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , do not take capsule . &quot;

&quot; the most common side effects are related to the effect of the capsules , resulting in more fat being ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , as you may have not reduced fat content in the diet at this time . &quot;
&quot; you can learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions , which you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Tell your recommended amount of fat evenly to your daily meals . &quot;
&quot; avoid taking the amount of calories and fat that you may consume per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ fat main dish or a substantial fe@@ ti@@ sh@@ ness , as you may have done with other programs for weight reduction . &quot;

over@@ weight has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • Diabetes • Cardi@@ ovascular diseases • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Spe@@ ak with your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
&quot; a permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals containing a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat health@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you will also find as an indication of the food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take up to a maximum per day . &quot;
&quot; note the tables below in this section below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat , which you should take with each meal . &quot;
&quot; which quantity is suitable for you , refer to the information below that indicates the number of calories it is suitable for you . • Because of the capsule &apos;s effectiveness , compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as previously , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by observing the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ise weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional effects . • You should try to incre@@ mentally and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This dimin@@ ished cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose approximately 0,5 kg per week , without creating frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . &quot;
&quot; • For a permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic calories and fat targets and keep it in . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials , which can help you nour@@ ish cal@@ orie and fat reduction and give guidelines to become physically active . &quot;
&quot; in conjunction with a program tailored to your type to assist weight loss , this information can help you develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional administration of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic medicine ) .
the application for patients under the age of 18 is not recommended since the effects in this age group do not have enough information .
&quot; this means that the drug inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to recep@@ tors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was studied in 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for the prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in heavily emet@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately emet@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting caused by a strongly oral chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on age , patients should be closely monitored with an am@@ nesty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable in the simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with pharmaceuticals that pro@@ long the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not to be used for prevention or treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tumor activity of the five studied chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , of a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , co@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , ch@@ ini@@ din , ran@@ iti@@ dine , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not available , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common adverse events ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) observed in a dose of 250 mc@@ g. ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least may be associated with Alo@@ xi in connection with head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the appointment ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were noted in post @-@ marketing reviews . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , there were similar frequency of adverse events such as in the other dosage groups ; no dose @-@ action @-@ relationships were observed . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy with an al@@ op@@ i@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a medi@@ cally em@@ eto@@ gene chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1.500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , received intraven@@ ously on Day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly oral chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 were compared to patients who received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on Day 1 . &quot;
results of the study with fully emet@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy and the study with strongly tel@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; following the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion@@ als involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy subjects was to assess the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration , a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ ally half @-@ value of approximately 40 hours follows an initial decrease in the plasma concentrations . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional in the whole dose area of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0,25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value measured after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; Eli@@ mination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver function disorder , the terminal elimination of elimination and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is increased , but it is not justified by reducing the dose . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were only observed after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate on the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of pre@@ clinical studies evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can extend the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately the 30@@ times of therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver canc@@ ers , end@@ ocr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as , adren@@ al @-@ kidney @-@ mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report in which the approval of approval for the transport of hepatitis C prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal product that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference doctors &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue shows damage , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ in- amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast produced by a gene ( DNA ) , which stimul@@ ates it for the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance composition , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of effect , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of the reference doctor . &quot;
the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment responded to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus had been detected in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int
&quot; in addition , concerns were noted that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed could not suff@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease ret@@ ard@@ ant again in more patients than with the reference doctor ; additionally , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the question of how far the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and stit@@ ched wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go is not intended to be used to treat infections which were prov@@ ably or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resist@@ ent Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Al@@ ar@@ go may not be effective against this type of infections . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the area to be treated may not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was de@@ fl@@ ated after the end of the treatment .
&quot; 119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients among placebo responded to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin @-@ dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were examined at home @-@ hours , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that were demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by MR@@ SA , is not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the Con@@ tractor .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks of short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , treatment is broken off , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will begin . &quot;
retin@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogens or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials of secondary open wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ opathy in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected position occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ ob@@ ulin and other top@@ ical methods on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after top@@ ical application on sk@@ ew@@ ed skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After an oral application of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on sk@@ imm@@ ed skin of healthy adult men increased by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , dosage adjustments are not considered necessary if top@@ ical retin@@ ot@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
animal studies have shown reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ as in the administration of a systemic antibiotic is prefer@@ able .
&quot; in deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ated or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / termin@@ ated , it is advisable to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go applied was the most common adverse event of irrit@@ ation at the administration , involving approximately 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance extracted from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ ed@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ ed@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
&quot; the active mechanism of retin@@ opathy is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding site of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances . &quot;
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
&quot; by binding at this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfers , blocking partial P @-@ binding actions and preventing the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance the use of retin@@ as in@@ ulin at least some types of infections should be considered , a consultation by experts should be as@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin over S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the event of failure to respond to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was performed daily under oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and s@@ wollen skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic recording on humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 was reduced to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
metabolism The metabolism in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ as in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro examination of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo @-@ investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility for oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 s@@ me@@ ared skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 @-@ times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ op@@ ic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were detected . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the transport agreement must ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as presented in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application ( Version 6.@@ 2 ) , is and works before the product is marketed and so long as the product is marketed . &quot;
&quot; the owner is oblig@@ ated to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance activities in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as described in the 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) and the additional update of the R@@ MP , agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for &quot; products for human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP will be submitted at the same time with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report . &quot;
&quot; to indicate irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area , you should end the application of al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or lot@@ ions on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it was not expressly prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in the eyes , mouth or lips , nose or female genital area . &quot;
&quot; when the o@@ int@@ ment comes from seeing on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the covered area with a sterile association or a Gaz@@ eta cover unless your doctor has advised you to un@@ cover the area . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic cap containing 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminium bag containing 0.5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two cans , and a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while imm@@ uni@@ zation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and that the vacc@@ ination can be brought to an end of two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defence ) , &quot; as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine approved since 1996 and the vaccine approved since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , however , in the context of one of three cans , two vacc@@ ines are administered . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults have also been used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix produced a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month gap between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most frequent side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , lack of appetite , pain in the injection site , red@@ ness , mat@@ ri@@ ces ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other ingredients or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals . a license for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the entire system . &quot;
&quot; the standard plan for pri@@ mor@@ di@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose is given . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated or ino@@ cul@@ ated with a combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A antibodies ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A antibodies ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured , whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have responded to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even with no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As for all vacc@@ ination vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and surveillance should be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the vaccine is present . &quot;
&quot; if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA @-@ units de@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value after pri@@ mor@@ di@@ zation , so that in these cases the administration of further vacc@@ ines can be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ ocular injection or intr@@ amus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal impot@@ ence , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ utter disturb@@ ances , Ambi@@ rix can exceptionally be inj@@ ected in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection as it can occur in these cases following intr@@ amus@@ cular administration to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ ity defects must assume that there is possibly no sufficient immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ ri@@ val@@ escence , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thi@@ om@@ er and preser@@ v@@ ative immun@@ isation formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ination doses were given to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ eness based on a basis per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a base per person . &quot;
&quot; after the application of Ambi@@ rix , pain was observed at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects ino@@ cul@@ ated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ri@@ val@@ ry per specimen was comparable high ( i.e. , over the entire vaccine cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who got Ambi@@ rix compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ eness was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old imp@@ lication , the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed in combination with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA @-@ A vaccine and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; for the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of Imp@@ fl@@ ingen , which reported about severe side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dos@@ ed vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen , was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials conducted at impact levels ranging from 1 to 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for Anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted between 12@@ - and 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 got the standard combination vaccine with three cans . &quot;
&quot; for the 289 people , whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 following the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immun@@ ity responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparison study of 1 to 11 year olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination using Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination using a combination vaccine with a combination vaccine of 360 ELISA @-@ A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; the immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to that , which after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units , was detected in a dose of 0.5 ml of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable to the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme for 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 12 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year at the same time with the release of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of present formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates similar to earlier formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after res@@ us@@ sing for any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
&quot; according to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state charges are made by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose . &quot;

&quot; hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food@@ stuffs and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in waters contaminated by sewage . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even though the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child already infected with Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill / feel ill ) vacc@@ ination may not prevent a vaccine .
&quot; protection against other infections , which damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; • If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can manifest itself through it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath , or swelling of the face or tongue . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the usual scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of a potential risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per V@@ acc@@ . ( 360 ELISA units of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with decreased content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccine against ending the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; • If you / your child is weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s immune system , or if you / your child under@@ goes a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child is taking another medicine ( including those who have been ino@@ cul@@ ated without prescription ) or if you / your child have been ino@@ cul@@ ated recently / has been given or have been vacc@@ inated or has been planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambient temperature , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; normally , Ambi@@ rix is not given to pregnant or nursing women unless it is badly needed that they can be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated cans ) : • Pain or dis@@ comfort at pun@@ cture or red@@ ness • Mat@@ ability • irrit@@ ability • head@@ ache • lack of appetite
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated cans ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • ligh@@ the@@ aded • gastro@@ intestinal complaints
&quot; additional side effects , which were reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 ino@@ cul@@ ated doses ) have been reported : &quot;
&quot; these cover local limited or extended r@@ ashes that may itch or can be brow@@ nish , swelling of the eye and the face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure loss and un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like dis@@ comfort , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain cr@@ amps , di@@ zz@@ iness , ab@@ norm@@ alities such as ting@@ ling , loss of sensation or movement ability of some parts , severe head@@ aches and sti@@ ff@@ ness of the neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions &quot;

notify your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child significantly imp@@ airs or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
the CH@@ MP represented the opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was put into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ite enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ia - split by several isolated doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered through a gastro@@ pod ( through the stomach in the stomach leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study because ammon@@ ia could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo ( a placebo medication , i.e. without a drug ) . &quot;
&quot; also , ammon@@ ia can lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , impot@@ ence , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle to high ammon@@ ia levels was effectively prevented .
&quot; ammon@@ ia was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because of the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval , only limited information about this drug was available . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme shortage has already been manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first months of life ) , there is an indication for the use of hyper@@ ammon@@ et enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake necessary for the growth and development of the patient . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight more than 20 kg and for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; for patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of car@@ bam@@ ate phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ phen@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the origin of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets are not immediately absorbed into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ ate @-@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; as met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at are done via the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased neur@@ ons increased . &quot;
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a hind@@ rance of the brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy associated with l@@ act@@ ate dose , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dosage occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which at intraven@@ ous dos@@ ages of up to 400 mg / kg / day showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound , con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kid@@ neys . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds included 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with mal@@ functions of the ure@@ a cycle can be thought to be produced for each gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ ate but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is set at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pre@@ diction of the earliest manifest@@ ations of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ aust , and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative path@@ ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post @-@ part@@ al ( however , within the first months of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which had already been treated with hyper@@ ammon@@ emic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ emic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many intellectual disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ phen@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated with sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible during treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine in liver and kidney , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine have been identified after gift of a single dose of 5 g. sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , as well as repeated gifts from oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral dosage of 5 g. of sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate in tablet form , 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary signs or ha@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma could be detected in the next morning after no@@ c@@ turn@@ al fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma gas were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ but@@ y@@ ate had no cl@@ ast@@ ogenic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children that can not swal@@ low tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ pod or a nose probe . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight more than 20 kg and for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; for patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of car@@ bam@@ ate phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ phen@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ ate @-@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite from phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the brain bark occurred . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy associated with l@@ act@@ ate dose , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is similar to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
&quot; on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram it is produced by sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible during treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral dosage of 5 g. of sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate in gran@@ ule form , 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected . &quot;
&quot; during durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure includes the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,@@ 6 g sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they can not ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products , which accum@@ ulate in the body after the consumption of proteins . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ ate but@@ yr@@ at can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you may not use AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as the drug may pass into the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , head@@ ache , taste disorders , det@@ achment of the hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have also been observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice one of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the introduction of an appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you miss the dose of AM@@ MONA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in the blood pattern ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , ab@@ norm@@ alities , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects you notice is significantly imp@@ aired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this usage information .
you may not use AM@@ MONA@@ PS after the exp@@ iry date on the box and the container after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified .
&quot; like AM@@ MONA@@ PS , and contents of the package AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the em@@ bos@@ sing &quot; U@@ CY 500 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 When laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ ate but@@ yr@@ at can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MONA@@ PS distributed to the same single doses or via a gast@@ ric fi@@ st@@ ula ( hose that runs directly into the stomach via the abdominal wall ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose which is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
&quot; • Take a straight edge , e.g. a knife edge over the top of the knife to remove excess gran@@ ules . • Take the recommended number of measuring spoon gran@@ ulate from the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the inf@@ usion can continue up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to help maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in sole administration or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots like Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the administration of GP@@ I - was as effective in preventing new events ( death cases , heart attacks or Rev@@ el@@ isation ) after 30 days or one year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who under@@ went a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox in terms of all indicators was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for heavy bleeding in which it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other mil@@ k@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with severe blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of AC@@ S and a PCI is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd a permit for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox in the whole European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ mid@@ ation inf@@ ar@@ ction ) ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or when an early intervention is fores@@ een .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous stu@@ cture of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is carried out in another sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI requires the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a cle@@ ft of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot;
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous cap@@ size of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one of the immediately adjacent intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us @-@ Gabe from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shor@@ tened to less than 225 seconds , a second coupling of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re @-@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed before use and the bol@@ us dose should be given intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function limits ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din for AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , a second coupling dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second coupling once again checked . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT was 5 minutes after the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ bol@@ us without dosage adjustment was aver@@ aged 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against mil@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or elevated blood risk due to mal@@ functioning of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial end@@ o@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for patients with di@@ aly@@ sis
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ val@@ ira is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if in the case of PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ira the most bleeding in arter@@ ial points may occur , in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , bleeding may occur everywhere during the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taken in war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is once again reached before treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation inhibit@@ or ) it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation inhibit@@ ors or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters are regularly monitored in each case . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies are inadequate in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in both the bi@@ valent group and in the compar@@ ision groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding was defined after the Ac@@ u@@ ity and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding like in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; ac@@ u@@ ity severe bleeding has been defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age of ≥ 4 g / dl with well @-@ known hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed blood loc@@ aliz@@ ations that occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; point points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
&quot; the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ val@@ ira in 6000 patients , who under@@ went a PCI . &quot;
&quot; both in the bi@@ valent group and in the compar@@ ision groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed in table 6 according to system classes . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosage , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is to break away immediately and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific thread inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the an@@ ion binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the Bin@@ ding of Bi@@ val@@ ira to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in turns the bond of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , through bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , with ser@@ um of patients , in which it had come into he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ z@@ ated thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ci@@ ated thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , no thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation reaction was induced . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ira shows a dose of dose and conc@@ entri@@ c anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation which is demonstrated by pro@@ longing ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was subsequently performed in the patient , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5mg / kg of bi@@ val@@ ira should be given and the inf@@ usion for the duration of surgery on 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h should be increased . &quot;
&quot; in the arm A of the Ac@@ u@@ ity study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) . &quot;
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or before starting angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or PCI .
&quot; in the Ac@@ u@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required an angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the three treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; about 77 % of patients had a recur@@ ring isch@@ a@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients under@@ went in 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infection with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or can not effectively process insulin .
&quot; insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from the human insulin , and the change means that it acts faster and has shorter active duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , where the body can not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of effectiveness was the change in the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) decreased after six months ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % at is@@ in@@ lis@@ per . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.30 % in human normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra cans may need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted san@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , th@@ ig@@ h or del@@ to@@ id muscle or to be applied sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion into the area of the abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; due to decreased glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active strength , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can change the insulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or abor@@ tion of a treatment , particularly in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
changing a patient to another type of insulin or insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the effect of the insulin @-@ based insulin and can therefore change in changing the treatment regim@@ en .
&quot; substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia are oral anti@@ diab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tic agents such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and reser@@ pin can be allevi@@ ated or absent from the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ines enter into the human mother &apos;s milk , but generally insulin is neither absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk nor is it res@@ or@@ b@@ bed after oral application . &quot;

&quot; Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is neg@@ li@@ gible to continuously change the injection site within the injection unit , may result in a li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia levels with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an appropriately trained person , or by the intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after a glu@@ co@@ on injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
&quot; insulin lowers the blood sugar level by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) , as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver . &quot;
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the action occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with a - man@@ ic normal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ on@@ tus , insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glucose @-@ lowering effect , just like a human insulin . &quot;
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast action as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ ish effect approximately 2 hours earlier than a human insulin .
&quot; from the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al gly@@ ca@@ emic control is achieved as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal was insp@@ ected , a better postoperative control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; the insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ c@@ emic control as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 minutes before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) , is reached . &quot;
insulin dose in dose 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal was given before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin doses at a dose of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) at the beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ ament insulin analog which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
