<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed compounds (tablets that are dissolved in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"presuppose thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disorder, a mental disorder, in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high-tuning) alternating with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes and for preventing manic episodes in patients who have approached the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disturbances when the oral intake of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for inhaling or melt tissue in patients with the swallowing of tablets difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines that are similar to abilify, the dose of abilify should be adapted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitter, "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to one another."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripidoczol is probably mainly used as a partial agony for the receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripibozol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but has a lower degree than neurotransmitters to activate receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripibozol contributes to normalising the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was investigated in three studies lasting up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia, or similar disorders that were suffering from anxiety, over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol in another study comparing the efficacy of abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which were subjected to increased restlessness, with the one by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the changes in the patient's symptoms were examined based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body resorbs the melt tabletten and the solution to the intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution, patients who received abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased unrest than those receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-time studies manic symptoms more effectively than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effectively than placebo for the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled), drowsiness (drowsiness), drowsiness (drowsiness), drowsiness, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in patients who predominantly used manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes applied to treatment with Aripidoczol, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution during the rapid check of increased unrest and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport of abilify across the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and discussed their manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased effectiveness of dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify amounts to 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripibozol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases following the start or after changing an antipsychotic therapy (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripidoczol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports about dyskinesia present during treatment."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if a patient treated with Abilify symptoms and symptoms of a late dyskinesia should be considered, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"when a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a grain, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of Mns, all antipsychotics, including abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripibozol should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripidoczol in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripidoczol had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, in one of these studies, a study of a fixed dosage, a significant correlation between the dosage and response to undesired cerebrovascular events associated with Aripiprazole treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polythenia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenics and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripidoczol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Familine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripidoczol, whereby this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripidoczol by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'poor' (=" poor ") metabolism, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripidoczol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the joint administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors, the dose of Abilify should be lifted to the dose height before beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with abilify can be calculated with a moderate increase in Aripimagenta concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripidoczol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethmorphine / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C19 (omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextromethmorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this drug may not be used in pregnancy because of insufficient data security and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies in the animal, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, the patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripibozol does not have any negative influence on them."</seg>

<seg id="68">"in the long-term maintenance phase of over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripibosis treatment and 15.7% was treated for patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprezol and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"CPK (creatine osphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripimagenta compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"side effects related to an antipsychotic therapy, and the incidence of malignant neuroleptic syndrome, haydyskinesia and convulsions, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or deliberate overdosages with Aripidoczol were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripidoczol, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose, since Aripidoczol has a high plasma probe."</seg>
<seg id="74">"it is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole is mediated in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine dopamine and serotonin 5HT1 receptors, and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors."</seg>
<seg id="75">"Aripibozol showed in vitro high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptors and for serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT7-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine receptor."</seg>

<seg id="79">"current values from measurement scales defined as secondary reagents, including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg- Depressive Resume Rate, showed a significantly greater improvement compared to Haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripidoczol showed a significantly higher decline in the rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprezol group and at 57% among placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double blind study of schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which comprised 314 patients and in which the primary study potential" "weight gain" "was a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg) with an average weight of ca."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprezol showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprezol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy trials for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, Aripidoczol showed a placebo superior to placebo, comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in addition, Aripidoczol showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partially over 2 weeks were not applied to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic indications, the companion therapy with Aripidoczol revealed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled trial for over 26 weeks, followed by a long-term expansion phase more than 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved a remission with Aripidoczol during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripizizol showed in relation to the prevention of a bipolar disorder, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyations of Aripibozol, the N-dealkylosing is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>

<seg id="865">"the study measured the concentration of a substance (glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="866">"Actrapane introduced a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, indicating that the blood sugar levels were similarly sharply reduced as with another human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="867">Acetaphane should not be used in patients who may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">"in addition, the doses of acetaphane may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar (the full list is to be taken from the package insert)."</seg>

<seg id="886">Hypoglycaemia can develop gradually: • Easy Hypoglycemias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">"diabetics should therefore always have grape crop, candy, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Heavy Hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg), or through glucose that is administered intravenously by the doctor."</seg>

<seg id="1658">"a treatment duration of over 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug can be repeated on the constipation of the nose."</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"when considering all hay fever symptoms except constipation of the nose, patients who participated in aerinaze reported a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1662">"when only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, patients under aerinaze showed a decrease of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who took Desloratadine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), mouth-dryness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other constituents, against adrenergic active substances or lauatadine (another medicine for treating allergies)."</seg>

<seg id="2669">"in addition, concerns were noted that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed could not suffice."</seg>
<seg id="2670">"the number of patients with hepatitis C, which responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alpheon, the disease retardant again in more patients than with the reference doctor; additionally, Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the question of how far the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), is not sufficiently validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (a skin infection with crust formation) and small infected infirmations (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and stitched wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">"Altargo is not intended to be used to treat infections which were provably or probably caused by methicillinresistent Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alargo may not be effective against this type of infections."</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the area to be treated may not be more than 2% of the body surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and inhibit the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was deflated after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">"119 (85,6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients among placebo responded to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin-dogs, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were examined at home-hours, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"however, in these two studies, Altargo was not effective in the treatment of abscesses (egg-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that were demonstrably or probably caused by MRSA, is not effective enough."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the Contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks of short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing of Altargo throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the event of sensitization or severe local irritation by using Retapamulin Salbe, treatment is broken off, the ointment carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will begin."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retinamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogens or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical trials of secondary open wounds, the efficacy of retinopathy in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected position occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retinobulin and other topical methods on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on skewed skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2)."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"3 After an oral application of 2-times daily 200 mg Ketoconazol, the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on skimmed skin of healthy adult men increased by 81%."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dosage adjustments are not considered necessary if topical retinotulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive-toxicity after oral intake and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retinas in the administration of a systemic antibiotic is preferable.</seg>
<seg id="2696">"in deciding whether breastfeeding continues / terminated or the treatment with Altargo should be continued / terminated, it is advisable to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman."</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that Altargo applied was the most common adverse event of irritation at the administration, involving approximately 1% of the patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"the Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance extracted from Clitopilus passederianus (formerly Pleurotus passederianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the active mechanism of retinopathy is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding site of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances."</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding at this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the Peptidyltransfers, blocking partial P-binding actions and preventing the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"due to the local prevalence of resistance the use of retinas inulin at least some types of infections should be considered, a consultation by experts should be aspired."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"there were no differences in the In-vitro activity of Retapamulin over S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in the event of failure to respond to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>

<seg id="2709">Metabolism The metabolism in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinas in human liver microsomites was primarily mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two cans, and a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"for this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while immunization is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and that the vaccination can be brought to an end of two doses."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"if a refresher dose against hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or any other hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given."</seg>
<seg id="2727">"vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the body's natural defence)," as it can fight against a disease. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens as" alien "and produces antibodies."</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine approved since 1996 and the vaccine approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, however, in the context of one of three cans, two vaccines are administered."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinrix contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults have also been used as proof for the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month distance between the two injections."</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children, Ambirix produced a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B."</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to a six-month gap between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the most frequent side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain in the injection site, redness, matrices (tiredness) as well as irritability."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, any of the other ingredients or Neomycin (an antibiotic)."</seg>
<seg id="2738">"in August 2002, the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. a license for the placing of Ambirix in the entire system."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the standard plan for primordization with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose is given."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"if a refresher vaccination is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated or inoculated with a combination vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A antibodies (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A antibodies (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"it is not yet fully assured, whether immunocompetent persons, who have responded to hepatitis A vaccination, need a refresher vaccination as they may also be protected by immunological memory even with no longer detectable antibodies."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"3 As for all vaccination vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and surveillance should be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the vaccine is present."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA-units deactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2745">"in case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value after primordization, so that in these cases the administration of further vaccines can be required."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"since an intraocular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal impotence, these injections should be avoided."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"however, with thrombocytopenia or blood clutter disturbances, Ambirix can exceptionally be injected in subcutaneous injection as it can occur in these cases following intramuscular administration to bleeding."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is administered subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infection with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or can not effectively process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin-lulisin differs very slightly from the human insulin, and the change means that it acts faster and has shorter active duration than a short-acting human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was used in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, where the body can not work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of effectiveness was the change in the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) decreased after six months (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% at isinlisper."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin-lulisin or any of the other components, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">Apidra cans may need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of Apidra throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall, thigh or deltoid muscle or to be applied subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the area of the abdomen."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to decreased glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of the active strength, the brand (manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can change the insulin requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An insufficient dosage or abortion of a treatment, particularly in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another type of insulin or insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the effect of the insulin-based insulin and can therefore change in changing the treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase the tendency to hypoglycemia are oral antidiabetic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, dipoxyphyllin, propoxyphs, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>
