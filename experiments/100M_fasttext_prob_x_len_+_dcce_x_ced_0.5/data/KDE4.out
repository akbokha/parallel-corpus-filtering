&quot; you can translate the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Web Site , select the output and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; if part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into place of the whole &amp; URL ; &quot;
&quot; machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case Bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , no important decisions should be made dependent on translations without checking the translation before . &quot;
&quot; only web pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated to the Bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can paste texts directly . &quot;
&quot; package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available . &quot;
more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select settings extensions ... Open the map tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list with standard Settings modules from the box ; add@@ ons . please note that more modules are installed on your system if you have installed additional software .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras decrease . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if any . &quot;
the modul@@ us filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s up @-@ to @-@ date working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbolic and text views in order to view the content of your local file system .
&quot; tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . this size must possess the property , that the sum of sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder shows the size of a folder than the sum of the entries in it . therefore , large files can be detected even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you can be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Pres@@ entation Visu@@ alization is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . for simpler navigation use the rec@@ tan@@ gles of sensible color specification and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over View Color mode , can either display depth to the easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is available at all , only if there is enough space for displaying or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angle is present . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; for Tre@@ em@@ aps algorithms , the rule should be maintained that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is quad@@ r@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; as spl@@ itting the surface of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries takes place , the implementation is left to the implementation . here it is always advantageous for let@@ tering and avo@@ idance of space losses by frames always advantageous to divide the areas that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns , or recur@@ sive branches . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry view View@@ ing on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the overall entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets developed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind application . &quot;
the picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you visit the picture gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can set the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the option title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option Pictures per line has a slider and a script to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the check box fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , specify if the file names are shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check box file size of the image , specify if the file size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the thumb@@ nail image size , specify whether the size of images below the thumb@@ nails is displayed in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder , you specify where the gallery will be stored and which sub @-@ folders should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection , save in HTML file , specify where to save the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set up a slider or a script to which level the sub @-@ folders are included . &quot;
&quot; if you want to copy the original images into the gallery , you can see if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery . &quot;
with the check box comment file you can specify a comment file for cap@@ tion of images in the gallery .
&quot; in the check box , you can specify a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provide easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect with your digital camera and to download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library G@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; work together . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; contains a fast image processing with basic image processing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the handling capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image plugin interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 bit color space and all available modules support the rough conversion by means of li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens , which can be searched for . &quot;
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ joined ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . they should therefore report problems and improvements .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tries to make the report of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests .... This opens a dialogue with a sub @-@ report system . if you use this link , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ joined ; is a project supported by a community . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ joined , we would like to ask you to answer questions about other users . however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should be powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ desk ; visit homepage to receive news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to learn .
the best start to get on &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to sign up in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ joined ; .
&quot; if you are digi@@ ti@@ zed ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you have to specify a local folder on your machine . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will also use as Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . setting up digi@@ ti@@ am settings &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder containing images , as base folder . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; views every sub@@ folder as album . no picture will be changed . while browsing the folder , you get a progress indicator like this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; dur@@ es re@@ course the library path throughout its depth . you can &apos;t exclude sub@@ folders , unless it i@@ ste in hidden folders . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste will not have photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; add your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My key@@ word in order to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw data support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , then &amp; digi@@ appeared ; possibly even with it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ Support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ ms and Ro@@ h Work@@ flow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect with your digital camera and to download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library G@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; work together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera is then used as a disk drive . the camera can also be used via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ v@@ ates . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ joined ; uses the g@@ photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital cameras . g@@ photo@@ 2 is also a free , re@@ distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows to transfer images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use serial ports for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now outdated . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the preview images of digi@@ ti@@ am . if the Exif support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to see thumb@@ nails or production could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ joined ; is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules with all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ joined ; itself . &quot;
to simplify the window you can either remove the page strings with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full@@ screen mode using F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
&quot; removing and storing images works everywhere : you can put a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ma , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , data list or searching . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Raw , Mo@@ vies and Audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the filter works on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind or symbol view is displayed . which fields are displayed , you can configure in the dialog of the default settings . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; provides a organized view on your photo albums . all the photos that were created by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed are stored in a single album room . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date the album was created first . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . you can also move or copy multiple photos in the same way . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and album properties to give you information about this collection . to access the album properties , you need to right click on the album and edit the album properties context menu . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Collec@@ tions : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection from you will be used to sort your photos , or sort albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album Date : will be used when you sort your albums by date with View albums by Date .
&quot; for this , the average of images from their EX@@ IF information is used first . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; this is to help you to remember the photos on the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select a different photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in order to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview &amp; quot ; select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be ne@@ sted .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports input of keywords for individual photos in the field My key@@ word list on the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . you can , of course , use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the frame window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fier buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time , you need to wait briefly while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid using this in which you can recre@@ ate any thumb@@ nails in the Extras menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image is displayed below the respective preview . which information is available , you can set up with settings digi@@ ti@@ zed ; set up . select the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nails to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails feature help windows that appear . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen shot above in the section introduction to the main window shows such an help window .
&quot; photos are all about it at &amp; digi@@ kam ; go . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of enh@@ ancements to this . you can choose between viewing the images , a slideshow or editing of images . &quot;
you can open image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 image editing ... or selecting the context menu of the image with right mouse button and Edit ... select a guide how to edit your photos . image editing lets you view and change your photos .
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ came ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button , and how to adjust it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store this data when you save the changed picture . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , iris , etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides two ways to shoot . the easiest way is to click the preview and select Rot@@ ate . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right click the preview and select F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , it is moved into the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 image del@@ e@@ tion or Del . if you prefer to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ bri@@ st@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the Picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date view in the Date View to show you only the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; tags are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a key@@ word was assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or search again . &quot;
&quot; when a key@@ word is selected , all the photos that have been marked with this key@@ word will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to log@@ ically organize your keywords . you can also easily navigate parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word li@@ ste@@ wards , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; tags are stored in a database for quick access and assigned key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also import your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My cut@@ off phrase ; or click on an existing key@@ word and then choose new key@@ word . if you click a new key@@ word after you click on an existing key@@ word , this will become the key@@ word of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a key@@ word by drawing it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears , which gives you the possibility to shift the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be once in the tree at a time . &quot;
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by right @-@ clicking and edit key@@ word in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
&quot; in order to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu As album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos that you want to use with a key@@ word , you can click on the respective key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords . alternatively , you can also click on the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select key@@ word from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can choose a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can set a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have a photo with keywords , this will be displayed in the main window under the thumb@@ nail preview . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word , in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Rem@@ ove from the Tags menu . the menu will show you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent indication of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be shifted using this hist@@ ogram . in order to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which displays the time unit . this will show all the related images in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below .
&quot; include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and even more in the future . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp is red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box like the one described above . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is done . the results will be selected in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after the search , you only need to select the appropriate entry in my search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select an extended search , the dialog appears for the extended search in order to change your previous search . more information can be found in the section The tool for Advanced Search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select &quot; &quot; Del@@ ete &quot; &quot; from the pop @-@ up menu . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ tization ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database database . any option can be added with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... , you can also search the Type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; character@@ izes each image by a long number using a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sign@@ atures . the smaller the difference between two image sign@@ atures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar Entries : this is an area where you can drop any image to find a similar one . if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of the un@@ used search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : free @-@ hand color sket@@ ch : draw a fast sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; find the appropriate images . also here a sw@@ ell@@ value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature . you can drag and move with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to drag a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ cache . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em Leucht@@ Box is added to the pop @-@ up menu . if you are back at &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , main window , you can quickly open the lumin@@ aire with L Tools . &quot;
&quot; from the preview strip , you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and place it there . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you want to preview synchron@@ ize from the tool@@ bar and perform zoo or move operations on one of the pictures , then you can compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you use m@@ ating pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to the same . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it in the right area . this simpli@@ fies it to work through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal del@@ e@@ tion actions also work directly from the light table such as F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the bottom end of each range you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to rotate the visible area of the image , you need to click them and hold the L@@ MB . in the mode Pre@@ view , both images will display the same image area . &quot;
the zoom works just as in other views . just use the zoom controllers under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the picture and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the mode preview .
&quot; digital inventory management considers every part of the process follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , sc@@ ans or stores digital photos guides a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we will give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , protect , protect , convert , group@@ ing , group@@ ing , securing , classi@@ fy , archive , optim@@ ise , maintain , maintain , maintain , maintain and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , trans@@ forms , trans@@ forms , conf@@ ections , and exports content that have a monetary or cultural value . quot ; &quot;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is stored in accordance with your definition data that provide information about or a documentation of other data administered by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then do not use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then do not use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; . the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide whether you want to save it to a reserved drive , or on a network drive &amp; etc . note that you will have to switch to a larger drive sometime . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the photos will be organized by your date . if you make enough photos , you will be able to organize sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of pictures to different subjects and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files match together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and work files makes a backup strategy and migration easier . you &apos;ll always know if you are looking for an original or a deri@@ v@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend to save the metadata in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ This ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? &amp; digi@@ tization will provide them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course these are the most important . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should now select keywords , inscri@@ ptions and a rating . of course , you can choose any images that need the same attribute , and then set the value . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos at the next work . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s continue with keywords , keywords , as you often call in other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import cat@@ alog@@ ed images from another source with embedded key@@ word words , then &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; automatically build the tree for you or place the images in the right place . the changed keywords are sorted by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; updated while it tracks the under@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; the graph shows how different metadata changes . this is a very coarse representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to inscri@@ ptions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you want to let most anyone just see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it more closely , then catch some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start dre@@ aming to have associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panorama completely . &quot;
&quot; for others who view your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving . &quot;
it is fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alised alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now starts with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities of using ge@@ ol@@ ocation are countless and will be deep@@ ened in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels with images with geographic data . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can also export the pictures to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps Viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a p@@ un with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights , in order to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all modified versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information should be stored in the setting side of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , then the name of a company or organization can be used . after this value has been saved , it should no longer be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; authors title ( syn@@ onym for authors ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider &apos;s field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photograph is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture offers here . &quot;
&quot; the solution to this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for most of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; a module for batch processing will be available in the near future .
&quot; topics : plate error , disk failure , current bu@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , life time , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics about the reasons for data loss . &quot;
&quot; to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these careful treatment must be treated and you may not be trusted for more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years . whether you believe it lies in your discretion room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you are using good disks and good recording devices . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right one . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we use for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection , they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust , etc &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ bu@@ ster that seems to work wonders for CDs and DVDs , but it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical Media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said on CDs and DVDs , of course , also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read the media . &quot;
&quot; disk manufacturers maintain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers of manufacturers include a new disk , but not the data . &quot;
&quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause , S@@ MAR@@ T may not notice these errors . some of S@@ MAR@@ T &apos;s faults are the most common error cause . these are particularly reading errors and publishing meters . the expected lifetime value is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files , but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices do not account much , this is different for devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious damage . therefore , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause severe damage . so , protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able result to loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and cuts the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector , but remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; because there is an over@@ voltage of each cable to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage sho@@ cks that also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and you also include protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in a non @-@ inter@@ ruption @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically make battery energy available when a power failure occurs . &quot;
&quot; this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected . at the end , you should always remember how well your computer is protected . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; they are , however , very expensive compared to hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . data transfer errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ proof . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transfer error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still alpha @-@ status . it uses the same protective mechanisms that z@@ fs uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is not yet a part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the workplace systems . for not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is already 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : un@@ true , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS , and X@@ FS to name the most popular file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investig@@ ative process at a sudden break during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft , and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings removed from fundamental physical limitations . this means that while technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras come in the direction of 10 megapixel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is better for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro , so don &apos;t blame anyone for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . secure your data often after a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as re@@ installing your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of disks . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses every day on an external SATA drive . if , then , one day , lightning strikes you if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft disasters : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention means always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs to the neighboring house , in your office or something like that . &quot;
&quot; there is another benefit of physical separation : as already said above , a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snap@@ shot at two times : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files modified since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time when such backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that are really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
secure important images directly after saving them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
&quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . &quot;
&quot; metadata in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , retain original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; the less versions you have used in the past , the easier it is to assess the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned scal@@ ability and want to expand the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate to a new disk :
&quot; check with the d@@ mes@@ g command , whether your new record has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&amp; Dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not exist any software you can read , then you can create it yourself . this task will be simpler from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should no longer use it . &quot;
&quot; it is los@@ s@@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit pro color channel and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TIFF has been widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( default ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . &quot;
&quot; DNG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed and open raw image format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format , and is required to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers will now also use Canon and Nikon to use it som@@ eday . &quot;
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to em@@ bed the &amp; quot ; Frame resource block quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive a original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can relate to problems with the link between the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ CM@@ I &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing , you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , then you should add the metadata again . these have possibly been cut off by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them to web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; in the section Ad@@ ding a photo to an album , you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface will provide you with many advanced settings to import images to your record database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; use it , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on display mode and turn it on . you will find a further description in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras do not provide preview images . if this is the case , a he@@ x indicator is displayed at the bottom end and thumb@@ nails of all pictures on the camera appear . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information on each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; the Metad@@ ata tab shows the internal metadata like Exif , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the metadata side strip from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of all . this downloads all the photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ joined .
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the choice with the default selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the button to download and then download Sel@@ ected ones . the chosen button can be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , there is an option New download available . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed until now . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you want to download the buttons all or download Sel@@ ected files , a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are sorted . you can read the list of existing records in the My Albums tab . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ joined ; loads the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at one time by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All . if you only want to delete a few , you must select it first and then delete Sel@@ ected Sel@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos are deleted from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do this via the camera system , because this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually used again after the pictures were deleted from the camera . this can result in double fil@@ en@@ ames , if you upload photos of different shooting galleries into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made in the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirror the image and file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this last option , a folder per day is created automatically . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options to be performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data about the author in the standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example in the editing field , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % H % H : % M : % S . please turn on the Date &amp; Time option . for further custom@@ iz@@ ations , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lo@@ wer@@ case letters . or in upper@@ case letters , if you prefer . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ BIOS ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you next time you open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can use all information about orientation of the camera at the time point of recording , to perform an automatic rotation during the download . not all cameras are ready to read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is normally turned on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , it makes &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photo in its original orientation . if you want to disable automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation in the lower area of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ appeared ; this is used to automatically download sub@@ directories in the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to switch off this option . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select High Load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the image selection is done , &amp; digi@@ appeared ; you , where the images are to be uploaded . select the folder and press OK to start the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in length and latitude and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be calculated by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser with a click that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; send users who want to locate the location of the photo , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ el@@ ites and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integr@@ ates a GPS unit . but there are a few connected with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ one or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save this data in the g@@ p@@ x format , since this is the only format that is supported by the module for geographic allocation . &quot;
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre @-@ characters ha@@ v@@ led coordinates , which are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ google . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com shows no European maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tries to give you as much control over its workflow as possible . in order to access these settings , you need to set up the setting menu ; setup dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
select action can be displayed on Embedded preview or image processing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; fix when you click on an entry in the main screen .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . even with a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; car title is a syn@@ onym for authors : this field should include the professional name of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as hired photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a more detailed description of the car field , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author , if the image is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this will ensure that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ joined ; these metadata are also available in other programs and can be digi@@ ti@@ zed ; imported without being lost .
&quot; image fil@@ ings saved as embedded inscri@@ ptions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the inscri@@ ptions embedded in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ appeared ; attempt to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ appeared ; display any file in a &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; album folder that has none of these extensions , by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored . &quot;
default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; the setting of the lumin@@ aire of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can be set to the default values on this page . however , whenever you open the illumin@@ ator , these settings will be enabled if possible . however , some images have different sizes and the syn@@ ch@@ rone mode is not available . if you have one , you can hereby receive better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar when you use image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image processing this picture mode can be switched on and off using F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling , the images can be enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the PNG compression setting you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality , since PNG requires a los@@ s@@ free algorithm . &quot;
&quot; with the TIFF files option , you can comp@@ ress the fl@@ M compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no effect on image quality , since the Def@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save losses . even if you select the los@@ sy attitude , the ratio between loss of quality and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata is not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , image processing was only an image viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog , you can change the image processing settings . &quot;
&quot; the default is that all green pixels are the same . if you use this option , this difference creates a mesh pattern in the output . if you use this option , this is a bit soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . default , it is a fixed color balance , based on a white card that was photograp@@ hed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images can get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the most pointed , so the parts of your pictures that are burned into the settings because of the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the pointed lights . the setting colors trigger some unusual results , because they can recon@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the pointed lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast saturated as green and red . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; and d@@ cra@@ w attempt to recon@@ struct the missing green and red particles from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; when you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be adjusted for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you must probably set it slightly higher than standard 1 , but this can also be done later in the images of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data generated by the color @-@ filtered image sensor , which feature a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lens , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for correct color correction , as you are carried out during the rough conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates color information and gives instructions how they should be given back . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ joined ; information such as color information is translated from a color space in the others to allow the colors to be as accurate as possible .
&quot; behaviour questions , when an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; color profile Fol@@ der Send to the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c , where you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; examine this folder then during startup . &quot;
settings of ICC @-@ Pro@@ files You have here the possibility &amp; quot ; default squ@@ at ; for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your images do not paint the entire screen .
&quot; the input files should be made to the camera manufacturer and model that you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have color ton@@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . this means that you have to do the ton@@ al mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your picture can be restored by a device . this is very useful before you print image , because your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated . this could you fix manually , rather than rely on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious what colour profile is intended for . unfortunately , not on Canon models . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image editing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ joined ; many modules support that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see a list of available modules . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks executed by modules , can be set in the menu under Settings &apos; Sh@@ ort@@ cuts &apos; . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the image transi@@ tions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . &quot;
&quot; the camera features on the left hand show a list of all cameras supported currently . on the right hand side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , which attempts to identify a camera connected to the computer . below are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire are supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) storage cameras . this field is only active when you specify a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera system . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , where you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and switch on . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera appears in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can display &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze the conversation ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be sil@@ ently controlled by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries , you will need to apply changes to the button changes . &quot;
you can also display &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze welcome screen display ; under certain circumstances this acceler@@ ates the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; .
&quot; setting Bei@@ m Start after new photos forces &amp; digi@@ kam ; search the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something has been deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ appeared ; check if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; use to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tization , you will find more information about it in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to fix and improve . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of preview and selecting the entry view / edit .
&quot; the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; therefore , you may not be part of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ame , enlar@@ ging factor and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top of the menu , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions . &quot;
&quot; editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have saved the file storage or button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; so you may make a copy of your image before you change it , so you can save it as a file . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery or the Rest@@ ore button to restore image processing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last store . &quot;
&quot; almost any image processing action can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be und@@ one by selecting the undo undo , by selecting the Rest@@ ore menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for undo , and mark C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment longer via the return rate or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos on the same album or key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can enter and zoom in the photo in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the view menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : choose the magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view where you can use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want to do this , you can also edit this in the display dialog . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sentences . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select Output Wiz@@ ard from the Album menu . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation arrows , even in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicks on the same tab leaves the side@@ bar appear or disappear again in the edge .
&quot; the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are compatible . the inscri@@ ptions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ TC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are turned over . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should observe these limitations . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented it , use either the App@@ lic@@ ator button or simply switch to the next image , the inscri@@ ptions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also read the metadata in the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images . &quot;
&quot; the app@@ rais@@ al shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can either be applied with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the short@@ cut of C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select it and use the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
the assessment will be made in the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the key@@ word view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key@@ word tree , and a selection box with the key@@ word used before . &quot;
&quot; the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered search word , so you can quickly limit the number of possibilities in search for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords . &quot;
&quot; the entry field at the lower end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by flag@@ ging the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the key@@ word IP@@ TC field .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main screen and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a sample with a key@@ word , please refer to the key@@ word filter section . &quot;
&quot; the page bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their Album , Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and search views . if additionally one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . a dialog appears , which asks you if you want to put the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the top example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is set to no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Other .
&quot; if you have a rule created with and created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the record searched for in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already placed in the database .
you can e.g. set an Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options :
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group . the options will then look as follows : &quot;
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / Tut@@ orial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly applied it to &amp; digi@@ tization ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner may have a predictable departure from your camera or scanner , and that the colors you print or publish on the web will match those of your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; when the issue comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions on every point of image processing work@@ flows . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
&quot; your only other image issues are by e @-@ mail or Web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another color space and make thoughts about paint management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to calibr@@ ate your monitor because s@@ RGB is calibr@@ ated . if you are calibr@@ ated to s@@ RGB , you must either calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve the image in most cases , so use it before trying any further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alize , settle , Automatic adjustment and contrast extend from the Cor@@ rig@@ ation Automatic correction menu attempt automatically to make your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ aire values across the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without changing its color sh@@ ading . this function is often a magical correction for images which are dark or well @-@ washed .
&quot; this method produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it only produces tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destroying it . &quot;
&quot; automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the red , green and blue channel . &quot;
contrast enh@@ ancements : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a restart of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
white balance from &amp; digi@@ joined ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; in case you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can do the white balance in rough mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm of the copy@@ ri@@ ghted by P@@ aw@@ el T. J@@ och@@ bal . they launch it via the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original image and the preview of the target picture can be seen . the preview is dynam@@ ically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original white balance again , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; the hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button , you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview , to use the selected color to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result displayed in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the buttons save as and load exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set , you can store it in a text file and load them later . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences panel res@@ ets all filter values to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust the coding depth per colour channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this enco@@ ding also requires more disk space , computing time , and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles .
&quot; another important tool can be found in the menu under color gra@@ ding correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several colour channels to the same time , so you can use it for multiple photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner always need the same error and you will always need the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the gra@@ dation tool that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tised ; mold colour effects include four colour effects , a solar @-@ ization effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar radiation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that resulted in a partially developed pressure of a short flash . the result was a partial negative image . the result was a partial negative image . this tool allows you to fine @-@ tune this interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; intensity controlled by the solar ion@@ ization . at about 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot;
this is an example of the solar energy effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors bril@@ li@@ antly and g@@ lowing . try it simply ; it emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level Level controls the brightness of the result and the slide re@@ peti@@ tions the thickness of the ne@@ on light .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be seen in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
&quot; if you make a photo in bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too great satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to increase satur@@ ation instead of raising it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool Ton@@ er correction is located to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue on this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of slider for the purpose explained here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , active channel or selected area . under the graph@@ ene , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the knob , and take care of how the picture changes . &quot;
&quot; on the right , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is updated dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : this selection box can be set to display the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear Hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic arrangement is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three controls : the upper one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the middle tones , often called gam@@ em@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ ks can be used in pre@@ viewing the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and light tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment . &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later . in addition , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all colour channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you will only see the effect only in preview , and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images captured with a digital camera , linear mode produces a broad beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a cur@@ v@@ ature to the right , for example , the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond to dark@@ er output tones and that the associated image pixels become dark@@ er . &quot;
&quot; to preview the original photos , a red marker is visible . if you move this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve you created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format . &quot;
&quot; if you have this method and the three color p@@ ette buttons automatically generate the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curves . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel you will see the combined result , i.e. you will see the effect only shown in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
&quot; the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; editing is a tool to improve colour channels , or change colour shades of the photos . &quot;
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the colour for hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint as you can correct the can@@ als by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with one &apos;s own rider . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target picture has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a colour leads to a visible rou@@ gh@@ ness that does not appear in the colour channel . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your Mon@@ och@@ rome conversion in which you can reduce the colour space first . &quot;
&quot; save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later , and then load . the file format used is the g@@ im@@ p channel mixer format . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all colour channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you will only see the effect only in preview , and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the lumin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color pictures can be converted simply on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;

&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , in all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . thus , like the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Green@@ filter . &quot;
&quot; Oran@@ filtered : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scene and aerial photos . &quot;
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow line filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
&quot; Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones as it adds a bit cold in the shadows . this is very similar to the process of leaving a pressure and the re @-@ development in a sep@@ ia oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother , and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) sep@@ ia il@@ ter . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a screen , the engraving of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . &quot;
&quot; relief : move this parameter to the right , increasing the appearance of the depth or three dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image . &quot;
a paper texture effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter Relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; add frame can be added a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter set the desired frame type for your picture . the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce envel@@ ops it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of value for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the frame decorated with the frame will be larger than the original but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of images , especially if you have used the tool according to aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into an image in any place . this is also possible at several locations if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply place the text and place it with the mouse . use text alignment , orientation , color from the color space and character set with its characteristics as you need . &quot;
&quot; any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
use the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; apply St@@ en@@ cil template to create a template using a picture .
the Picture St@@ en@@ cil Tem@@ plate apply in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
&quot; there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you must use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to minimize the file size of the sten@@ cil . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings are scheduled for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for templates , a tree view appears that mirrors the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the templates pane . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , you can find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this knob increases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button decreases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to post@@ p@@ one the picture below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides three different tools for sharp@@ ening . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and easy , but creates , especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular images . &quot;
&quot; bl@@ ur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . actually , it doesn &apos;t shar@@ pen it , it works rather psych@@ ologically . it works rather psych@@ ologically . the algorithm was taken out of Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focus is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
&quot; the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally require more det@@ ri@@ mental sharp@@ ness than normal cameras for home users . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG images , a camera is often used for internal sharp@@ ening . images in the raw format have to be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners use a sharp@@ ening filter while reading the image . if you disable it , you will get the control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharp@@ ening a photo with sharp@@ ening sharp@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; in general , the most suitable technique for sharp@@ ening an image increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges . in general , the most suitable technique for sharp@@ ening an image is to re@@ focus the tool . in general , you can focus more information and a comparison of all techniques to focus . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : one image is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool for sof@@ tening using the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ation sof@@ tening and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in radius or amount increases the effect . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore you should best shar@@ pen pictures in their final resolution .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ ot@@ ted image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the sw@@ ell@@ value is a frac@@ ture from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference @-@ sum . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference for a edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ t from shar@@ pen@@ ed and therefore plastic defects in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image is the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted extraction filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienn@@ ese filtering . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienn@@ ese filtering . the traditional technique for sharp@@ ening pictures is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focus mostly achieves better results than bl@@ ur@@ red . you can launch it from the menu by selecting colors in image processing .
&quot; in practice the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ ules , which are far from the original pixel . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures , the default value 1 should result in good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close 1 , and eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ening effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . &quot;
&quot; gauge &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos; s sharp@@ ness . if you use a value un@@ equal , you should also increase this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in mat@@ ri@@ b size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gauge . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and File Buttons will be used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set , will be saved for later and can then be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try to perform all the trimm@@ ing , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations do not immediately visible changes that are not immediately visible , but which later leave in@@ convenient arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you click and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
generally bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king produces better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening .
&quot; in theory , the result of the F@@ IR Vienn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the F@@ IR Vienn@@ ese filter is often better than the sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Vienn@@ ese filter is often better in handling small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
the original bl@@ ended colour image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an an@@ alogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information about the methods of sharp@@ ening the image in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the smooth@@ ness controls the bl@@ ur@@ ring of the range that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the ink ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can set it here . &quot;
the tool mal@@ function correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove undes@@ ired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail Posi@@ tioning p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a smooth smooth@@ ness over the image . &quot;
&quot; alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly into all directions , while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ ding or CCD noise , a high value is generated by a high value of wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ness factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ness . therefore set this value matching to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns higher structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going to run . usually here 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle @-@ incre@@ ments da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be selected small . so be sure that small angles make a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
&quot; linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only small , but it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . we recommend it to let it out . &quot;
the buttons save as and load exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
&quot; correction of image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation anytime with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
the module will be applied to a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an an@@ alogue camera . as you see there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreg@@ round that caused by a poor film storage during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters available to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor screws from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings dialog can stay with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel is needed and can wi@@ pe the image . &quot;
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing to see lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubric@@ ate occurs again .
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value enhances the filter response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or smo@@ other tips may occur . if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts with no details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance density : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve one image . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve one image . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma toler@@ ances of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas , which are typically smo@@ other , but also contam@@ inate the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; absorption : controls the alignment of phase j@@ itter absorption . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius respon@@ ds to variations of lumin@@ ance . when it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . &quot;
&quot; save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction , which you have set , can be saved into the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . &quot;
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is tagged with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool for sof@@ tening using the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ating sof@@ tening and experiment with the smoothing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; these filters for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ ired art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gra@@ dation , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ ti@@ zed images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture rendering . the texture rendering is performed with another tool , the image defect correction , and the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ ase ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the buttons save as and load exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
&quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button Finish . &quot;
the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been added with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected one ( 2 ) can be seen .
&quot; below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been applied to an old color photo , which was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by the scanner lighting and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ pack ; the Hot@@ pixel tool allows you to remove Hot@@ pixel from photos taken with a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially when high @-@ quality raw mode photos are a problem since many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &quot; &quot; light Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image extraction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the preview preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you directly connect the dark image to detect new hot or light pixels using CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark image to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard notices the last dark image and will automatically load it again in the next session . &quot;
the image area and preview will help to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to see the broken pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; average : an average of the adjacent pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
&quot; square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels on the block . &quot;
&quot; cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are approached to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels on the block . &quot;
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , often cannot illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reaching the light that reaches the sensor there . teleph@@ oto lenses also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many Center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise bl@@ ur effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure of today &apos;s fil@@ ing and color or gray scale depth of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a gra@@ ding filter by using a gra@@ ding filter . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker . &quot;
with three controllers you can check the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction filter and with three further exposure of the target picture .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of fiber absorption at the point of the largest density the filter . the default density is 2.0 , which compens@@ ates for an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate the density by a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of pixels . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er re @-@ adjustment of the target image exposure , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; editing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lamp strengthening and contrast correction was also performed in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geometric patterns . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second degree covers the general geometry of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x shape of the image .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third grade has a similar round effect , but fl@@ ap on the edges . this correction is not applied to the tool . &quot;
&quot; the co@@ efficient fourth grade correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of the distortion of second degree . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion of fourth gra@@ des . this value appears stronger at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners &apos; has the inver@@ ted parameter of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value re@@ stores image size and results in correc@@ ting the first gra@@ des . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
bri@@ gh@@ ten : this value adjust@@ s brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview will illustrate the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the barrel or cushion distortion should be done before all cutting or size changes . best , perform this correction as all first . if you cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the fro@@ g . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal assistance line . move it to an important location , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the sp@@ un / cushion distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the transforming crop out of image processing or via the zoom controllers of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives , such as recordings from front , frame and painting , is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left @-@ hand side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add Film Fabri@@ cation when you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . green law@@ ns are white like snow !
&quot; as the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , since the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared camera effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the pointed lights .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Fil@@ ters Filter is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , to increase the sensitivity of the films the manufacturers mix big silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the screening effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery style , street photography , gra@@ ined sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome images , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , is set to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grain , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gra@@ dation effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and still@@ s are good for this effect .
&quot; two controls exist to influence this effect . the upper one chooses the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush is better for large images . smoothing the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter carbon drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon cop@@ ze . images of their gra@@ dients are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ch you . this would be good pictures to begin with .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adapting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter engra@@ ver shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter Grav@@ ur is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity , to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the picture into cells and makes it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave @-@ blocks 1 the picture is distor@@ ted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using non @-@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
zoom Un@@ shar@@ pen : wi@@ pe out the image along star @-@ shaped lines that take center stage . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al weed : bl@@ ush the image by turning the pixel on a focal point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a turning camera .
the object appears to step back into the background .
&quot; motion bl@@ ur@@ ring : wi@@ pe the picture by horizontal movements of the pixel . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking pictures , camera . &quot;
&quot; this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or adding a warm and subtle g@@ low . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ wei@@ ß@@ fe : bl@@ ur the picture by acci@@ dental postpon@@ ement of the pixel , thus simul@@ ating the bl@@ ur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera . &quot;
intelligent in@@ efficiency : finds the ink in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation anytime with the button Finish .
the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps on your picture . this gives natural your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the drops . since the dro@@ ple@@ t size doesn &apos;t grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops in the image .
&quot; use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p , the range will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . &quot;
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ p filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) points a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . &quot;
&quot; photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to enlarge a photo , with minimal loss of image quality . &quot;
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you retrieve the missing information again ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose transform size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is visible below . &quot;
&quot; the tool to size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow up . &quot;
many image processing programmes use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation e.g. sp@@ lin@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ joined ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
&quot; maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns higher structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , because it is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the buttons save as and load are used exactly for this purpose . enlar@@ ging each image for photo can be saved as a text file , and can be loaded later . &quot;
&quot; infl@@ atable is very fast with what it makes , but it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button Finish . &quot;
you can see below an example for photo bub@@ bles by magni@@ fying a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement .
&quot; editing a photo is not just a frequently performed operation , but also a commonly under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you have to create with the mouse simply the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rect@@ angle , create . you will see this rect@@ angle when you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo is cut off . you can change the size of the area to cut by drawing at the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can create a new rect@@ angle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the trimm@@ ing , use the button Der Zu@@ slic@@ ing button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview section , you can change the rect@@ angle of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains . &quot;
&quot; depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as a high @-@ format or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the width of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio cuts a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you &apos;re cen@@ timeter , inch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can set the max . ratio knob the area to cut to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when you use the trimm@@ ing tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the cooperation aid allow you to blend aids , so that you can put together your images better . these help include : &quot;
&quot; harmonious triangle : harmonious squares are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third bar , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into a similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als . &quot;
&quot; golden mean : the golden center is a division divided into different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a nau@@ til@@ us shell or the pet@@ ting leaves of a sunflower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden pitch is the ir@@ rational number 1.6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks , which used to create your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the figure is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resul@@ tant divi@@ der is 1 : 1,6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden center provides more flow@@ lines when you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third bar , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads to the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow on this way . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to guide the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this can be just there without guiding the eye , it will fulfill its task . &quot;
&quot; the gold tri@@ angles are also derived from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . their ver@@ tices are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equivalent tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to place diag@@ on@@ als at these lines can allow a static object to appear more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . &quot;
the Horiz@@ ont@@ al Flip and Ver@@ tical Options can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be rendered invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool for turning a picture around any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera down ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image processing and tool free rotation . select transforming Free rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the default settings button you can set the slider again to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is shown on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right .
&quot; for your help , the module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . once you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a print on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; once you have turned a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function transforming crop cutting out of image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is the Automatic crop function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after rotation . but note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point to the so called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture . the preview is then automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels . &quot;
angle left at the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right at the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
corner left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
turn right at the bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the picture becomes a bit dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after which you adjusted the perspective , you get irre@@ plac@@ eable tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transforming crop out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is no turning , the image is distor@@ ted . in other words , a right angle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; use horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed right from the preview . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; for a single she@@ ar , this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two layers produce twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the restoration , the picture has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ iling . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on your system at this point , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; displays only files in formats that are known . this is done by file extension and a comparison of them with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the picture editing , you can change this list of file extensions that will be digi@@ ti@@ zed ; accept . in the configuration section , you can find more information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to even select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports both formats .
&quot; image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . redundant information is reduced , in order to store image data in a more efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also be saved los@@ s@@ less if this is indicated in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , go to Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very useful instructions in English . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; support the store of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is included in &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ation@@ . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that from &amp; digi@@ joined ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; it is not a film editor and therefore has no embedded options to display or edit movies . if you click on a film file &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use the program to start playback .

&quot; if you change the steps 4 and 5 , which you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustments with the module white balance . &quot;
many tools you need the photo processing are available in &amp; digi@@ pack ; included . your description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , sof@@ tness , noise suppression , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur m@@ w , &amp; etc ; . use a common dialog box that shows the effect in a preview before the filter applies to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture applic@@ ation@@ &apos; ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview field . these modes are :
the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected display area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ licate . the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected display area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , the upper part shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter . &quot;
mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can switch to show over and under exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the picture from which you want to preview the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the properties tab shows the essential information about the selected image and is extensively self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters in shooting the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature . you can drag and move with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to drag a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to select and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the p@@ allet files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can either be applied to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; Settings and hot user @-@ defined color and Zul@@ u used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or search the folders for files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the p@@ allet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the p@@ allet view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; in order to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ urs@@ or is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color board at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check box over@@ write under Bei@@ m C@@ urs@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions of copying , cutting and past@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character , if there are three figures in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; inserted . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color pic@@ ker on the left .
&quot; graph displays are used in science , especially in computer science , graphs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; programs that include graphs ; programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ mo@@ graphy ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ graphy ; is a K@@ DE program to view &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; co@@ graphy ; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; the graph is re@@ comp@@ uted and in &amp; k@@ mo@@ graphy ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ mo@@ graphy ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
other required software : &amp; k@@ mo@@ graphy ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; required for representation of graphs . required in detail :
&quot; the main window displays the open graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ mo@@ graphy ; without an argument , the main window contains only the icon file open and the ( empty ) list includes open files . click the first icon to open the dialog . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; alt ; button ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file is currently edited by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ charged , or whether you want to ignore the change . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a Grap@@ h@@ file outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ mo@@ graphic viewer ; open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ mo@@ litho@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the plot@@ ters to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change them afterwards with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when starting the program , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph is to be split on multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph come into one page to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you retain the aspect ratio , pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
&quot; page preview with one on multiple pages distributed , without head@@ line and with a different font &quot;
&quot; the Renew@@ al Shop page provides the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore changes ) or ask the program every time . &quot;
opening the page opens the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ mo@@ graphy ; specify when a graph opens outside a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
&quot; the page session administration gives you the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ mo@@ graphy ; specify a default behavior ( open or not ) , or decide to be asked at each start . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which normally appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N ; appears , opens up additional possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; graphic layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&quot; &amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for directed graph@@ ene . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representation of directed graphs . the algorithm tables the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge over@@ laps as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the default for un@@ balanced graphs . it produces representations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical over@@ sized sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; -@@ algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model layout for un@@ balanced graphs . it uses the Fru@@ ct@@ man Rein@@ gold he@@ uris@@ tic , and includes a multi @-@ wire trigger for the treatment of large and clust@@ ered graph@@ ene . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module read images provides tools to read new pictures and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . at present two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the S@@ ane project or another source like video streams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and S@@ ane installed .
&quot; if you scan the images in the menu entry , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default duc@@ r@@ he default values to select your image . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the button scanning , you need to wait until the scan is finished and the window for setting the options of the image file appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore created very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; or create it by saving the image . &quot;
&quot; you can create screen shots after selecting in the menu &quot; &quot; Im@@ por@@ ter &gt; Screen photo ... &quot; . &quot; a window appears in which you can set the different screen shots : &quot;
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all of the windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible place of work . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window is read in the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay in high enough to have the time to navigate . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot was made , the dialog provides options for the target image with the options described above . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I Modul Gallery Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I Modul Gallery Export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team mailing list at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ module for geographic location allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF key@@ word of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic location provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and latitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in the g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ One can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ relative . this interface may merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears . in order to load a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
when the file load is loaded an automatic correlation performs the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera time zone here .
&quot; the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you do not have track data from one place for images you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data . if you know that in reality is a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog shows the coordinates from a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set by the displayed map . to do so , select the region and enlarge your si@@ e.@@ guide it again and again until you have reached a sufficient level of accuracy . the card can be changed manually between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Modul Gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums to a gallery of HTML pages compliant to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages , and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you don &apos;t need to select them . the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ zig@@ show &quot;
the tab defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder containing the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures is also stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth you can change the default color depth , which naturally also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nail image allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album Ri@@ der for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or shifting . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is shown in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is increasing , as no compression of color information takes place . for example , you can also find it in PNG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team mail@@ ing@@ list at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently does not have documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look on ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a pre@@ defined length . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can choose a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slides . after that , you can create the module via Tools MPEG @-@ slide . &quot;
&quot; the images you have selected are then listed under picture files in the Portfolio . there , you can also change the images or the contents of the list . &quot;
&quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that shows a picture . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the m@@ peg file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start the production of the movie with the button . depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages via the button settings right below . &quot;
the print job allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened using the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct print@@ out .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes , you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w . &quot;
&quot; first select the raw file to be converted and start the module . the raw image converter window then appears in the mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the essential parameters like G@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG version can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera operates in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect . &quot;
&quot; once you &apos;re satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name stays the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; Tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all the information on your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to process your pictures frequently or later on , you should not select the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in memory format , the metadata contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el to cancel . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write existing file . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce or increase the image : four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 Dimen@@ sions ) : change in size into two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : no proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; print preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is possible to change the size of the pictures to be sent before .
&quot; after you have started the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right side . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and place them there to add you to the list of images to be sent .
with the button pictures remove the selected images from the list of pictures to be sent .
&quot; after you have selected all the images , click OK to open the New Message window to your e @-@ mail client . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . &quot;
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of the emails you send . it may be a good idea to send several e @-@ mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must enter the right path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and added to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the PNG format under the Picture file format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among los@@ s@@ less formats like TIFF . therefore , you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; when you select JPEG image file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ Data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages , in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button Lock you can close this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL transi@@ tions option in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to own a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slide shows will be very slow . &quot;
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the pictures will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option to select pictures by chance ensures that the images are shown in a random order . so it will not be the order of the images in the album .
the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should test it before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly select a different effect in each transition between the pictures .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide . &quot;
&quot; on the left bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;

&quot; in the picture each person has the same icon in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save their own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to locations , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view to use for each category separately . &quot;
&quot; you will need to select the image for each individual . in order to do this , you will need to select the image view window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the appropriate person . in the check box window , you can select the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you open the entry in the main window , a dialog will show you a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once more . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string into the cap@@ tion or description field , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be part of the total date , i.e. e.g. 1971 , or the entire date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user &apos;s Guide for &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but want to try out the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album , and watch the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; start for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then , some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; try . &quot;

next select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created that is to be seen on the overview page . more information about the export files can be found in .
&quot; finally , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed , which is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all images are of a party . note that &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; for example , you can not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically dealt with . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . this allows those to view your website and have a monitor containing the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you have defined . so , you can browse your images with lower resolution , which results at a lower transmission period . if you want to see an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; best select a base folder for all of your HTML files , and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; once you have created your images , you can check if they are all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be started after the pages have been created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them to it . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings that are currently described have all three related to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name will set you in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you may , of course , create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . image properties are exported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ in file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ in file searches the images in two @-@ fold mode . first , you search through the images found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the Export menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
&quot; if you want to copy it to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
copy &amp; paste the images automatically to the .@@ k@@ im file near the .@@ k@@ im file ; the images are automatically for you .
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the option export file . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum size limit . if you send your friends images , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... select , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; export the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the assistant to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are the category persons of the file you imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and which categories these are in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse images and view : if you look at images , you often want to jump within different picture groups . if you want to see pictures of your holiday in Italy and discover a picture with your friend on it , you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) capture the information about your images , via ( 2 ) to browse and view , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can backup to a disk or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , for example , where you want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; remember the folder in which your images are stored and automatically re@@ use it for future starts . if you want to read another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ Photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; in the following section of the user manual , you will see the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; to the left , you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which can be accessed by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also set up your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog , which is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in this section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Dialog Options , you can set up full member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of explaining all groups of a member as explained . &quot;
&quot; in the left window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ ti@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system means K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . more information on this can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most of the modules have a help page that you can access via the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used together by several applications together , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can always test new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications using K@@ IP@@ I modules are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order for some modules , so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ate &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all images showing you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
next to the current album I have to give the modules a list of albums . here &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; as follows :
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you &apos;ve defined in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . for example , if you are using the category person , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; so do , if you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE desktop application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; is the ability to see each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted in the picture , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures simultaneously . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen are included . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; this is a very important part of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album , because you can always use them again and again if you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and you can see the same 5 @-@ 10 persons on all 50 pictures , you can , so that the names used are moved up , finding and assign@@ ing people faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting icon after date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and add these images to your comments . in this case , simply click on the thumb@@ nails before and back buttons , which can be seen below the thumb@@ nail preview . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it may be more convenient to highlight all these images and to use the menu item additional entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you will see a browser window showing the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special icon will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the note dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new title or sub @-@ category . additionally , you can also drag an entry in a category to make it a sub@@ category of this entry . caution , this assumes you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . see this . &quot;
&quot; you can move the single elements of the note dialog by clicking and p@@ anning the boxes , which form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from within a frame by drawing it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted the appearance of the window so to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the options ... that offers you among other things the possibility to store the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a box completely . if you want to see this window later again , use the options ... and here window a / out . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all images in case you do not set filters . you can configure the thumb@@ nail size by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button . just try it . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on an image , this will appear in the picture viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete images in the preview preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and select either the Rem@@ ove button or select the Edit selection menu . now , the window will appear that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; it offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; i.e. , you may have saved the pictures somewhere , so &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can view the view of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; if not all necessary pictures can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; pictures in which the right upper corner is trun@@ cated , are not saved on the hard drive . for example , the images 1 @-@ 9 can be seen . however , for pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the preview images can be displayed . however , you can not view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires that you copy files from the folders and copy them back . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; so it does not support you to insert the respective CD . so , if you want to avoid trouble on how to avoid confusion of your images , please buy a larger disk for storing all the images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the View menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , please filter the pictures in such a way that you can open those that you want to see for others . alternatively , you can also use all pictures that your little sister can see , control and lock the menu entry everything except current view . &quot;
&quot; you have set out which images are to be hidden in case of case . if you want to give your laptop now to your little sister , simply select the menu entry to lock images , thereby removing all images that you have locked . if you want to see the images again , click lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply choose password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are not very familiar with the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can manage all of your pictures with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; for hours and hours to describe it is natural that you want to contem@@ plate them at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album features an image _ and video viewers . this can be started from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in sight . of course it shows the image , but additional all information you have to enter about the image , such as who is in the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the information box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed . all of these options are available after right @-@ click on the viewer . the then appearing context menu can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see the matching entries for this display . so if you click Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; in case you have downloaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slides . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image loads can be controlled by pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; S buttons . &quot;
&quot; a very useful feature of the be@@ holder of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full@@ screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can drag and zoom into the image . you can use the mouse to draw a rect@@ angle with the mouse button . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom in the middle of the image using the Min@@ us button , showing how a zoom angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the dot button , you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the uni@@ formity button sets the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ oming operations that work for videos that are in and out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ play with the plus and minus key .
&quot; with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make notes to the current image using the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at images , it may happen that you will find an image with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can open the look and open configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . however , you might prefer to select only the image and view more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with characteristics while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the appropriate letter . in this picture you see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and especially features can be displayed in thumb@@ nail view . if you can view categories in the thumb@@ nail view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the attribute after the image was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; in order to turn on the painting from the pop @-@ up menu . to exit the painting , just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all accommodation objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu item . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; by del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with error description . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render only a part of the texture ( for example texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cruise locally . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag them with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window .
&quot; each object has a level of visibility as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object , or as an absolute value . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement , or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust them as you like . you can also store multiple windows and switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under a view , drag the starter to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle indicates the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views over one another , drag the starter right in the middle of another view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the map leader at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . in order to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the starter onto the desktop or click on the small left @-@ left arrow in the support bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu you can find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them anywhere . &quot;
&quot; the current window view can be saved with View window arrangement ... Save . a dialog appears , in which you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 is up to date . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dern Symbol Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar or select the Sc@@ ene menu . &quot;
&quot; a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview up to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or in the View Grid View menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but meaningful is a name that lets you see the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card @-@ card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination field quality you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflective lighting . for a detailed description of R@@ ender properties , see the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . &quot;
&quot; these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . in general pictures with this feature better look .
&quot; when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is continuously parti@@ tioned and adap@@ tive because the rec@@ ur@@ sion@@ st@@ ef@@ e depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are monitored individually and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch on j@@ itter , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays by a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for the quality of the rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this feature .
&quot; on this board card , you can set whether the alpha @-@ channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams have not hit any object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray is finished , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; import the scene , select File Im@@ ports ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not want support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you want to import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
copy &amp; paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene rendered . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height data ) in paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used to display the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type plates .
&quot; you can set the object @-@ catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model page@@ views . here , you can set the grid apart for shifts , sc@@ aling and turns . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more precise wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; when you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for advanced projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering . &quot;
&quot; when you cross a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the floor , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the floor is displayed in a check@@ er@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you reci@@ eve edge smoothing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more exact data on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the section window arrangements , you will explain how to create and store window arrangements . &quot;
the combination field standard window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of existing window arrangements displays all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views using the Rem@@ ove button .
&quot; with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with unlimited anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with map view , you get a card view along with the previous view and floating down the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , very popular among beginners : a sphere on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should consider following warnings carefully before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
if you do not insert light sources your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
&quot; if you have installed everything error @-@ free , at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er you will see the following set @-@ up window arrangement : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols right now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the camera view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the racing scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points that you can change the focus of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you press the button or press En@@ ter , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the perspective of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( inser@@ ting final body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as a floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly or En@@ ter . in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wi@@ re@@ model view also shows the plane , even if at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case , you will only find the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its properties . there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog will open where you can choose how the object is to be inserted . please select first sub@@ object . the pig@@ ment will then be displayed in the property view ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the Pre@@ view button see how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pig@@ ment preview only shows a weak black material because you can check the pig@@ ment settings at any time . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on the cu@@ ff and ball in the preview , click on the App@@ ly button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is set right now . if you render your picture now by clicking on the icon , you should receive the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , choose color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
you should already be able to run this step as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball is just as easy to create as the floor :
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input key or the button apply ) , so the ball would float above the floor as you shifted the floor around one unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering now yields a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already at the bottom , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; select first sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click on App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the brightness effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good idea of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully , you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender calcul@@ ates the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the image is just black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a storage space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since last saved are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last reverse command . you can select this menu entry only if you have to do so .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , the short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option pre @-@ set short@@ cuts for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
you can use this option Tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a b@@ ump map is a way to design rough surfaces without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
&quot; basic elements are simple geometric shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look . &quot;
texture map is a way to specify the surface of an object color on pixel basis by using an image file as color chart .
&quot; &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select images for viewing . &quot;
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
using &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can display with click the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or click Return .
&quot; you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . &quot;
&quot; in the Dialog Control &amp; D@@ airy Show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and Mach@@ ining and Slideshow , you can set the mode of work of &amp; ku@@ ff@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short instructions for the browser , you can set the short@@ cuts for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can adjust further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still see the current picture . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
&quot; with this option , saves the name of the last opened folder . at the next startup opens &amp; ku@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can create &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show , so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
determine if the slideshow will start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
change here the short@@ cut for the various modes of operation at &amp; ku@@ ff@@ show ; in the box cards short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser .
with this option switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
show the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo processing based on the digi@@ tization ; picture editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a quick image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and make correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute his part to , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and requests . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers will help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo , then we would like to ask you to answer questions about other users . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . in order to access these settings , you will need to set up the settings show@@ picture in the menu . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color indicated when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the color with what you are supposed to display . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar on the right edge that gives you important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side bar in the image processing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; channels ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes scanning and storing images .
&quot; &amp; channels ; is a simple application to scan images , which no longer power than images to scan and save images . can save a dialog for each image or save images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images before saving . &quot;
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sc@@ roll@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal , if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel will quit &amp; shri@@ mp@@ it ; quit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; channels ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
&quot; to scan an image , the user can only start a pre @-@ scan and then scan the scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to select the picture better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . he can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits in the window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image is displayed in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the Settings button , the same name dialog will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option Before saving you should preview a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type such as &amp; channels ; images save . dialog to save for each image opens the dialog in front of each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; gu@@ err@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; the default value is your home directory , and you can change this using the button ... change . &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for automatically storing images and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is stored each time a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used for storing . this value also changes compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; channels ; manual . the button Über starts the K@@ DE talks for &amp; channels ; . the button settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; output .
&quot; &amp; channels ; is licensed under the GP@@ L , and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; channels , under L@@ GP@@ L . attention : li@@ bs@@ ane is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cut lets you set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select short commands ... select .
you can set up existing multimedia keys so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Sh@@ ort@@ cuts work . this will make your keyboard an &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Control Centre .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which mostly can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , playlist , play@@ lists browsers and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function pause could be &amp; z@@ b ; look like this : &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script , if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run . &quot;
begin require &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialogue - sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . &quot;
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P your script can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; which each K@@ DE installation should be included .
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages permit exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; send noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if it does not have any use . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the setup dialog . to store and load the setup data , every script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder , where all data should be stored . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ Change signals that a new piece is all@@ uded . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information on the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value of 0 to 100 .
&quot; custom@@ Min@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Title are also passed to the menu item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ er@@ Menu Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ er@@ Menu Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed in order for example to perform clean@@ up work . this includes , for example , saving data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar Archive ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be used with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the exhaus@@ tion of amar@@ o script . for this reason you should name your script packages right away .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can click on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org click on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i Scrip@@ ts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; Scrip@@ ts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you just want a certain title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you &apos;ll find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you have already some play@@ lists , you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard to choose , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the correct music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources you have to type the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should have no difficulty when comp@@ iling . if you encounter any problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the configure script to compile with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met to allow them to be used . for details , see System Requirements section . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without trouble using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; if the option is off , only the Play@@ list window is displayed ( sh@@ own@@ .@@ Ju@@ K ) . &quot;
use the mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
&quot; put m@@ oods in the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok , should be started when a browser is needed . &quot;
&quot; use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list . &quot;
&quot; save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when moving &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , based on the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces when changing the piece , it causes the play@@ lists to open / off to keep the running piece always in the visible window area . &quot;
switch to context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is applied .
in the section Ap@@ pear@@ ance you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Ap@@ pear@@ ance . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting O@@ wn Writ@@ ings , you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : play@@ lists window , player window and context browser . press select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of custom color scheme , you yourself have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector enabled for foreg@@ round and background color . &quot;
continue playback when starting out that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start playback automatically continues with the piece at the point where it was stopped at the last stop .
&quot; set up the O@@ SD sub@@ window . if on @-@ screen display is connected , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the ability to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . clicking on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if specified colors are not enabled , the default colors will be used . &quot;
&quot; the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by typ@@ ing plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users , enabling you to set up the O@@ SD on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment . &quot;
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate further settings in this card .
the card card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . in order to include a folder to the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
&quot; search sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok , both the cross@@ linked as well as their sub@@ folders to search for music . &quot;
&quot; monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; import play@@ lists : add that &amp; Amar@@ ok , add all play@@ lists found in your collections folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the play@@ lists that are automatically added will appear later in the play@@ lists browser . &quot;
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : allows you to choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l is necessary . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used for setting the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on machine : will enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use username : and password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the card card last@@ .@@ fm depends on the support for last@@ .@@ fm . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ fm profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one of the last@@ .@@ fm website . &quot;
send un@@ played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting enables it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ fm profile .
&quot; call a similar interpreter : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the each played piece . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ fm profile to be able to use this feature . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including programs included , for example modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some features such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the tag@@ lib developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash . after that you can delete the file and restore the collection again .
most of the time it is because Tag@@ lib crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the tag@@ lib developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a little mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable autom@@ . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use at least 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via email ( the email will automatically open during a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash , and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into met@@ a information , but they are not known as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed using this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are easily forgotten . &quot;
&quot; if you get this error : opt @-@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are most easily resolved by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; bug@@ zilla is not suitable for searching for help . please enter only one error , if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok yourself . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to intui@@ tively keep the interface , the start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you can find it under Extras / Statistics . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the user rating , while the points are automatically calculated . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the review column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column view rating . you can also use the Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; short@@ cuts . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , then press release on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and let them fall there , just as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , next to the Add button , you can save the playlist playlist . click on it . &quot;
probably missing the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config utility . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual ; this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is available in the context menu ( right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which pres@@ et no MP3 deco@@ ders are supplied ( for pat@@ ent@@ ative reasons ) . solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
&quot; if you are using the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device needs to provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time , or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you search for the problem of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide another sink ( e.g. , located ) . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper su@@ id is set : &quot;
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ MO co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . increasing the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ multimedia completely to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes eed &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then drop all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with gst @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . now start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
please report them at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes you can best send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . place an alarm in your calendar program and run this command with the alarm : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will have stopped by the gentle tones of music you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to find out the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles when you are on a different computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : ss@@ h -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user your@@ server name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pl@@ aying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA file .
&quot; the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; windows , pressing d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , variable @-@ size window . &quot;
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece in the queue sequence into the queue . by pressing the input key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; click on the name of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers should be displayed . &quot;
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and there are many error messages on the console . what is now ?
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; insert the CD into the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . instead , drag files from folders mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ o@@ str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , character F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more the play was played , the less influence each individual review has on the total result . &quot;
&quot; you can edit the valuation for a piece by yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the play@@ lists window . then , you can select the valuation of a piece as well as all the other attributes , namely by selecting or pressing F2 . you can also edit the rating in the Edit Metad@@ ata dialog . &quot;
the developers do not want to tell you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publication plan that is not to bring together with the short @-@ run Amar@@ ok plan .
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , but some users can also find annoying . disable the option icon when playing in the General settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click on New Design to install .... &quot;
&quot; the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
Kon@@ quer@@ ors navigation pane allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings ( the top ) and select in the Ad@@ dition Switch menu .
Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces can be played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports . &quot;
probably was &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new configure and install .
&quot; now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; probably use a distribution that distri@@ butes the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you will need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . then you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards you will need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without a p@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : don &apos;t use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; I get the error message &quot; &quot; There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad module is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a @-@ files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad module must also be installed the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module . &quot;
you will receive the error there is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play a MP3 Stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator . then run Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
&quot; setting Amar@@ ok settings ... Audio output specify the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , des@@ elect the tick on sound card support m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not taken care of . if you like , you can get the new so much @-@ needed support for the Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you want to update your collection afterwards , this quick start guide should help you . with your help , you will have set up Amar@@ ok ; in just a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag the mouse entries from the collection browser to the playlist . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the Play@@ list . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have the option to import play@@ lists , you can then click on a playlist to load up different ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please select the audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD tracks in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the Play button . &quot;
the audio CD @-@ feature uses the protocol audio CD : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function also exists in the playlist . just right @-@ click on an entry and follow the burning menu .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ ose the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally some additional packages are listed which make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok can be used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your One @-@ Click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Centre . at the top of the window is a scroll indication displaying the current play , bit@@ rate and sampling rate of the current play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the scroll text display . you can change through the available Analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , larger window . &quot;
&quot; the blo@@ b PL and E@@ Q are also displayed under the scroll indicator , or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used to establish equ@@ ali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window is made of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece position slider . use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume . use playback buttons to start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio operators . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to Tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own preferences . &quot;
&quot; to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you check the Connec@@ tor E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that do not exist in any other player , but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter them , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; in the navigation pane , you can find some of the most excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context @-@ browser . &quot;
&quot; the context @-@ browser features different information regarding the current denom@@ ination . its appearance can be adapted using context @-@ browser designs . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text , and interpre@@ ting . these three sub @-@ windows are later used to detail in detail . &quot;
&quot; if you already have earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , you might notice that the sub@@ window is dropped off . the information presented there is now distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can also see the information collected in the statistics window ( Tools statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window Music shows information about the straight running piece , as well as the interpreter and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first area in this sub @-@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you will see the cover artwork of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to see the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you can find more information about the current play . you see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its valuation .
&quot; the pictures may have any names , but images with the word front in the name are treated preferred . the context browser will also display covers images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Recomm@@ ended items , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on any of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the suggested pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer . this area shows the five highest score pieces of the current artist .
you can set which information to display in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be un@@ folded and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also right @-@ click on it and then choose one of the options to add the play or album to the playlist .
&quot; this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try downloading text for the piece from the internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which one to start . &quot;
&quot; the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database , and no running text script is required . &quot;
the button Find a search on google.com after the lyrics for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing interpreter - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see con@@ stell@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various performers . &quot;
&quot; singer / year - album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the standard 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by one another . the performer will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them after performer .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above , but is sorted according to the album below the interpreter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you have something at the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this could take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly under the tool@@ bar , there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . &quot;
&quot; there are several time frames available , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . &quot;
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection @-@ browser you will receive the following options .
download - This will emp@@ ower the current playlist and insert the selected pieces in the currently valid order .
attach to playlist - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect .
&quot; set pieces in queue - this function will insert the selected pieces into the queue , so you will be played next . &quot;
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you &apos;ll be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer the pieces into the media player to transfer the pieces into the media player . see the section on the Media Player Browser .
&quot; burn all pieces of this performer / burn On CD - In this way the selected pieces are burned to K@@ 3@@ b and either burned as a dat@@ a- or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) Shift the files in the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; as a compilation , select the selected album as a compilation , and it will appear among different performers . &quot;
&quot; up@@ lift up - Change the album marked as a compilation album back into a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be displayed under different performers but again under the respective interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser is easy to use with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ list@@ box contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click on the smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Sub@@ window Media Player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to use for example your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod after performer sort in the top list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list interpreter . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar is a search field where you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z enter and press En@@ ter , you can drag and drop music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping files . in this case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : thereby dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place . once you enter letters , only the pieces that the letters contain are displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty again . &quot;
&quot; when you enter by spaces separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; when you enter between the search terms OR , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found , one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then complete the search term with ge@@ ese feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries , which include Mike Old@@ field , but not by entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
&quot; you can combine these syntax variations as you wish , for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either include Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 , and do not include the comment bad . &quot;
&quot; you can set the sequence sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order click on the entries . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left hand side , you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons follow back and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the center of the tool@@ bar , there is a unique , larger analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you get in the player window through the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and selecting tool@@ bars ... &quot;
&quot; the status for random mode and retri@@ eval , a slider for the playing position and the playing time of the current play is displayed . the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by double clicking with the mouse in the corresponding display area . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the General settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . &quot;
one click on this entry opens the visu@@ alisation plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ alis@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry there is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
cover management is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can launch them by selecting the Cover Management in the collection browser .
cover management includes list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select : &quot;
&quot; the queue management received your big entry in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you still have more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , you will see a number next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as a second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; you can easily add the pieces in the playlist , then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( the details to set up these later ) . &quot;
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds another random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ fm -@@ Recomm@@ end@@ ations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that you already have some pieces in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ fm profile for this dynamic playlist .
&quot; double click on the playlist , drag them to the play@@ lists window or right @-@ click on them and then select loading . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two selected Mo@@ di random@@ ly mix and play@@ lists mix immediately fill up your playlist , and you can add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended tracks will be added at least one piece yourself from your collection , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . this mode can also be disabled again using the same menu entry . &quot;
&quot; the New Player button fills up the current playlist , adding new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit playlist will open the playlist dialog and you can change the settings . &quot;
&quot; by right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you can click Edit . then the dialog will open to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will grow continuously , the setting for upcoming pieces will be b@@ yp@@ assed and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while listening to the playing pieces . &quot;
&quot; pieces played - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each play . if you set more than 1 , then the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random items from each of the checked play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on Set@@ ting .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts by clicking the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please look at the section &quot; &quot; Writ@@ ing Scrip@@ ts &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins are used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start is intended to show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to track the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that when you re @-@ enco@@ ding to MP3 , you can check if an audio CD is created from a los@@ sy format . you can use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can do nothing . please wait until the machine has finished the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start is intended to show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to copy a data @-@ CD in just four steps . to track the steps , you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and the source CD inserted into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data @-@ CD , please select Extras , CD Copy ... from the menu . you can now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have done all the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you can now see a dialog that looks like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the original image is entered into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium on which the data should be burned . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait now until the total rate has reached 100 % .

the Q@@ T @-@ Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; k@@ de ; wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem you start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / k@@ de@@ 3 / plugins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS with your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
&quot; the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org , where you will get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get rid of feedback on community help from the forums and learn about news . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 . &quot;
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in one pass ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a text @-@ like description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ is@@ ofs ; : burn all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; offers , and extends these functions even . therefore , select &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually reached &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; but a higher quality for burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ free and professional audio enco@@ ding technology and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . &quot;
&quot; l@@ ame : a well @-@ developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by MP3 @-@ Enco@@ der module . &quot;
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder and the external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible to de@@ code w@@ ma files to burn them to an audio CD . &quot;
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ x Audio Enco@@ der Module .
Trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : an auth@@ oring featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without Norm@@ alize , the different record levels of the various albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically record all videos in the root folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
&quot; save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue Save is displayed with which you can choose folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
save all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call save for each single project file .
&quot; closes the current project . if a project has changed and has not been saved yet , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then cancel between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will en@@ qu@@ ire for any un@@ stored project , just as if you called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; closes all open projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ stored project , you will be asked what to do with it , as if you had called a file closed . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you view the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files that are added appear in the root folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the dialogue &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the characteristic dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; it causes files from a previous session to import into the current project . this is useful for you to view files from previous session to the current project . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders existing on the medium .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project .
&quot; alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD that you can then burn later . alternatively , you can only create a copy from a CD that will then be able to burn CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD that will then be able to burn a DVD with the help of the copy dialog . therefore , the target medium must be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely er@@ ased . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to choose between the writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c file , which can then be burned simultaneously by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , so you need to use other tools such as Nr@@ G@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of content , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read @-@ in video , enco@@ ding settings , and even ways to change the size and cut black margins . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content is displayed in the Content View . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting of the medium . &quot;
the Content View is also the interface to read audio or video CDs when a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD was selected in the folder view .
&quot; the header is a narrow range that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header line does not have real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard short@@ code further down . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . this allows you to set correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wiz@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on startup . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine adjustment of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de applications , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so your taste and the nature of your task is decisive , which of the included programs give you the default . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then add something like the following to the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , all the &amp; k@@ de ; programs have common , support &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , format DVD and additional functions for generating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Recor@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String Routine ) void ad@@ dur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; thus , it is possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then insert files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Aus@@ les@@ er for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , very simple audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der installed on the machine . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in wa@@ v files on disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that enco@@ ding this WAV files ( compression @-@ free compression ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ free and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed to the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or even in other formats such as the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders are already installed . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ ding / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction to enco@@ der , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to avoid any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , then the daily handling to read a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand for the lean approach of the user interface , about which you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is collected manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the main window commands . step by step , for example , there are more information on how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starting the C@@ DD@@ B request of the CD @-@ data according to the establishment of request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if a enco@@ der is configured in the Code Settings tab in the setup catalogue - enco@@ ding .
a sub @-@ menu opens with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection can be read with a different enco@@ der than the standard . it must be noted that before the enco@@ der in the Code Settings dialog is configured in the setup dialog .
&quot; open the file manager , so that an already selected file will be selected for coding instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ ts ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main editor dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different map cards ( such as Enco@@ der , to configure the enco@@ der ) . here , you must go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can restore these files . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats that lose information by means of data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate differences are less important , since both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + High to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG players is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide for most people and most pieces of music acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a track . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11@@ 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you want absolutely highest quality without regard to file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information collected manually or downloaded by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the enco@@ ding program to generate folder and file names and the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of code settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters you can use ( = button name in the wiz@@ ard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the calcul@@ ator . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , Name of the pieces etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal but I ( note of the translator : this means that the author is meant ) am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from receiving information publicly available on the &amp; CD ; so neither the artist nor the music company can be added any more , so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; can actively choose a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b may be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than the one in the system . in this way of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only know the program@@ mer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator is created for use by fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org supplies a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which output program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the proper distribution , if this is not done yet . &quot;
&quot; on the first opening , pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) can be found on the enco@@ der tab . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the Linux distribution concerned before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ der . more information on Ko@@ di@@ ers can be found in the Ko@@ di@@ ver chapter .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the enco@@ der installed . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , writing and reading real to it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fl@@ ac &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is considered as non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic setting of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is likely to be done once and &quot;
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what each reading &amp; CD needs to be repeated .
here we determine the enco@@ der to use for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change them every time you read a &amp; CD , once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the output program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD / DVD drive is present , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the map general settings . here there is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is as bel@@ low / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of incomplete information , please select , so that you will be informed when information about generating key@@ word ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
&quot; note : the machine must be connected to the Internet during the reading of the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server . &quot;
&quot; the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector is easier , a &amp; CD entry is found , immediately the scanning of the &amp; CD starts . this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; aside from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , then de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , this is over 620 MB big , consider this twice whether this is worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; C@@ DD@@ B is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server via the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
C@@ DD@@ B server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby .
&quot; both work equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls are bo@@ iling the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want any &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so simply try yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; ej@@ ected after reading the last piece : tick this to the CD , to throw at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you cross this folder , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the files are stored in the private folder . do not forget this folder , if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances a little bit has to be brow@@ sed to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting compression ratio is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression ratio is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
&quot; number of wa@@ v files to be enco@@ ded simultaneously : with a dual core or square or even a multi@@ processor machine , attempts to enco@@ ding more than one wa@@ v file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we just have the basic setting up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you &apos;ve chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD is written . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , was first described and set up in the previous section . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data collected for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of retri@@ eving it from the Internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this sample to find . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD has to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a brief moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , please consult the section Ques@@ tions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you will need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist must no longer be entered in the &quot; &quot; Current Title &quot; &quot; input field unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the bottom comment field can be used for each comment ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ally per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful withdrawal of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words with capital letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see Help to the enco@@ der to get more information .
for more information go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example can be found under Rock .
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the CD editor &apos;s window appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply type the entries for the pieces of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear when you download the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the list .
&quot; note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece . only the tracks selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or select the All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at a time . &quot;
&quot; when selecting the selection process by clicking on the selection process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what happens . &quot;
&quot; click on the rider &apos;s orders for switching to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message tells you if you are trying to work with a enco@@ der you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . did you check if you have read access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece .
&quot; the job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the enco@@ ding of piece 1 into MP3 format . so read and code in parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . the machine used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( of however two different pieces ) .
&quot; now the last title is read out while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is placed in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message appears in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. res@@ h respectively 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is maintained today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre@@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . install the package k@@ de@@ multimedia from your distribution . if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at persons who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different programs has many variations of settings . read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different cart@@ on maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hi , still reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked according to the first start of the program , without any cl@@ ue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive is located ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; who reads this , probably has already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot;
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it &apos;s as the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; thought . whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it . and if you read this he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion .
&quot; strange if you have succeeded to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke player by &amp; k@@ de ; beside others , it also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke live displays , also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop that you can drag &amp; drop into &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to pull on k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
&quot; when you finish a song while playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows in the &amp; k@@ mid ; drop windows . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry Ab@@ play from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you pull it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows . ( for several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played afterwards . ) &quot;
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid plays a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the knob . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ Show and thus change the playback speed . to get back to the original tempo , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the piece , so inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . pressing the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ tual events ; others use song events and other both . some pieces have no text : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set up which events are to be displayed , and even better : the event type is automatically detected , which allows you to set nothing manually . so if you select Autom@@ ati@@ te text selection in the Settings menu , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type . &quot;
&quot; in case you want to specify an event type , select the items from the Settings menu and select items from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summ@@ ari@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find them in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize ... Click New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
&quot; you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on the copy , and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . &quot;
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the slider in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when using the application , this collection is not saved . remember when you add a lot of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic adding to the collection .
&quot; when Auto Add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when the collection is not activated , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then add the remaining pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the row after from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the Next song , the next song next song from the menu or press the button arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song back , select the button Previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu items or press the button arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers that are not general MIDI . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map general MIDI events are translated into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that changes all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and can thus sound a trumpet whenever originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound@@ card , you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -@@ KO@@ MP@@ AT@@ IB@@ EL ( incl . A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM machines and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all necessary implement@@ ations for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite is that each occurrence has a different text identi@@ fier ( see below ) . &quot;
define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE key@@ map &quot; Name of key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE key@@ map &quot; A more key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that DE@@ F@@ INE is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be for devices that are not general MIDI @-@ compatible .
this section shows how to map the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) .
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard doesn &apos;t support a gun ( e.g. with note 60 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with note 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shooting . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shooting ) , it removes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the note 60 , no matter which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that this is meant with the word drum patch , where each sound is a different percus@@ sion@@ ist ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 items . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
&quot; the key@@ maps are mainly used to map tones to the percussion channel . for example , take a look at the provided key@@ maps . &quot;
&quot; this section can be used to map out some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply do this in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the percus@@ sions patch on the percus@@ sions channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which ratio pitch @-@ B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value n , this is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM gives a keyboard that gets a pitch @-@ B@@ ender @-@ Event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two notes up to one oc@@ ta@@ ve higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; around . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under Settings , point MIDI settings . &quot;
&quot; the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pian@@ os , you see which sounds are being played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button does not lights more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has two different views ( up to now ) to display the played tones . view the View menu in the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . this allows the same MIDI file to run on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed and etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support , you need to download and install a distribution distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree , that &apos;s why it supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
&quot; before you select Autom@@ atically add to the collection , you will need to add a temporary collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . in order to restore the standard tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD . &quot;
&quot; I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; draw . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn the setting Autom@@ atically add to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first , just want to play the first file . so , set the setting Autom@@ atically add to the collection and open A@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you so much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; laga ( Spain ) written by &amp; Ant@@ oni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard , or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . &quot;
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; written entirely in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anyone for it . I would like to stress that I am only working on it because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - recti@@ fying the bug that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
&quot; my thanks also applies to Jose L@@ u San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ d@@ son , Marc Di@@ ef@@ enb@@ ru@@ ch , Peter Gr@@ itsch , Magn@@ us Pfeffer , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ theim , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error notification or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
&quot; on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and look at images . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , etc . &quot;
&quot; a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ th , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not hear music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections from the Favor@@ ites menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Defin@@ i@@ tive playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you have an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; updated play &apos; , TV and continuous playlist can also be changed through direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to select the ren@@ ame playlist from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes will be lost , when the editing mode is abandoned or another group will be selected to match the playlist . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; the animation of starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ er@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 , if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during start @-@ up does not need to be short , it will automatically termin@@ ate by opening another source . however , this would distur@@ b the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ bound &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet ; / lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; in the source package of &amp; KM@@ Player ; are in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; KM@@ Player ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bug@@ ging is the &apos; console &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player .
&quot; there is no rider for this device in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything has to be configured by editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ er@@ c , just like setting the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ zilla : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even be inserted the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; so that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &quot; flash &quot; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash must be specified in the setup dialog file of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; so always a given back@@ end for a certain ime type is taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manual modifications to ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ er@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should restore all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog is used in the settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DRC &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports ( e.g. it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B contained in it . &quot;
&quot; because the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video file must be supported only on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . therefore , the following should be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally , by KM@@ Player for the sources various names are used . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , source , source , source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ d@@ source . &quot;
are there any hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive more silent when I play from it ( not from V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be executed as a user root after the device is connected . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine only starts off slowly but why does my CPU need to be tested for its performance every time ?
&quot; note : the answer is outdated . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphic user interfaces and network support and is required to compile and compile .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . Unix @-@ like systems will probably rely on the package &amp; tex@@ til ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD / DVD should be used .
the &amp; K@@ ile ; project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; K@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the K@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the K@@ ile ; website should be made . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions or comp@@ iling &amp; K@@ ile , or if you want to add extensions , this should be addressed at the mailing list K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; work area . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; features in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; applications . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management need to be called . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn more about it the manual should be drawn to Kate . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct pron@@ unciation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use can also use a lay@@ ia ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the last name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
&quot; here only a good survey on &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do so . for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the quick @-@ entry wiz@@ ard of &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful feature for rapid creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) offers some options for the creation of the document . it can also be done on the document specific settings .
&quot; document classes : hereby the type of document to be created is selected : article ( article ) , Book &#91; book &#93; , Cover &#91; newsletter &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ Book &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
enco@@ ding : hereby the character enco@@ ding is set . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . at best should UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be chosen ( for correct processing of lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
&quot; this list contains the most frequently used add @-@ packs for lat@@ ex ; for integration , they only need to be selected in the check box . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about themselves . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information on this are given in the section .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; it offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic execution of the settings , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically creates an empty line ( for typ@@ ing the text ) and the corresponding line for setting the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the file ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the document to be sub@@ divided into the following elements ( the most common and sub@@ paragraph is the lowest element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse . &quot;
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very useful for recovery . once a DVI ; file has been created , jumps &amp; K@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ Viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text . &quot;
&quot; a DVI , file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as the font , and is besides PDF the commercial output from &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for various systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the back search , the elements of the DVI file are linked to the editor , and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked , the previous search is the exact opposite of it . the previous search is the exact opposite of it . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project preferences . &quot;
quick @-@ build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is connected to Windows registry and it is not a call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick incorpor@@ ation of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... &quot;
&quot; the sel@@ ector box For further information about items such as tags , entries or references . the options available are : &quot;
&quot; description : with this command a name for a section , an image or other element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files can also be written in &amp; K@@ ile ; by hand .
&quot; the last selection box named size e is used for setting the font size . it can be specified for the main text , the joints , etc . the following font sizes are available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; K@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document may be written by hand . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font size . if the font size is not set at the beginning , this can also be done later in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code needs to be compiled . the simplest way to do this is the use of the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Bauen or Kn@@ op@@ fs quick @-@ installation . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; K@@ ile ; the storage is automatic .
&quot; the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be searched in the logging according to the errors . if this is not the case , the logging should be followed automatically . &quot;
environment ) is a text which is treated differently from the rest of the document .
the changes are only made within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes in an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and usability of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ , or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive print and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be shown with \ \ emp@@ h { word } it@@ ali@@ c .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language was presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; K@@ ile follows now . &quot;
&quot; once a bit of text was entered in the wiz@@ ard , a few adjustments should be made for the better legi@@ bility of the document . for this , a quote , a few passages in fat and ital@@ ics and a poem should be applied to see the differences between these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , editor opinion or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( by the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screen . &quot;
&quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - you can print the document by file printing ( in viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . as soon as the DVI , file has been created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion can begin in woven other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
preliminary search allows direct jump from editor to related position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; K@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . only Modern can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... Tools to build .
&quot; to search for the pre@@ text search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and end up on pre@@ text search . the jump to the corresponding spot in the DVI cable is then carried out . &quot;
with this feature in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Document of &amp; K@@ ile ; open and jump to the corresponding line . this must be set as text editor ( set up ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
&quot; if there is an error , this is displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the logging file causes the source of errors in the source text . in the editor , the no@@ d@@ dle pre@@ he@@ aders La@@ Te@@ X errors and hard@@ est La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumps between errors . to view the error message , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; K@@ ile ; jumps to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; if you select a blank document , you can either re @-@ write a document from scratch or use the wiz@@ ard to quickly create a new document . &quot;
&quot; temporary users of lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using a file New , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in settings file ... Settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are being replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the simplest way to create a template is to use the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps have to be completed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the default ones . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . if an easy way to create a template , it should be searched for an internet connection and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ate ; used as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the ability of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( among them also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be done in the menu directly from &amp; K@@ ile ; out .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to experience his abilities , the hand@@ book should be drawn to Kate . users of &amp; K@@ ile can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a very convenient &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called over the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all the commands in &amp; lat@@ ex ; can be used as well as their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex command . this means that in this way clicking the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text will be copied automatically to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to search the most different kinds of source files and highlight them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many wiz@@ ards can add additional spr@@ ing@@ marks . this is a separate type of bookmark within the text . the menu handles jump marks , or the corresponding push @-@ button handles the jump to the next or last spr@@ int brand . this is also highlighted by this jump mark , so that at the first input of a character it is automatically deleted . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; K@@ ile ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; important functions for their selection . under Edit excer@@ ts , the following commands are included in text selection : &quot;
&quot; select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with mixed lines ( like in other text editors ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with mixed lines ( like in other text editors ) . the only pro@@ ver@@ bial case in &amp; K@@ ile , is that the deposits are separated by two blank lines . &quot;
&quot; select the word below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command is also available with a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to remove any part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; offers the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ate ; offers with own commands for faster results . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is included in the description to Edit For@@ ms paragraph .
it has been clari@@ fied that environments plays a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore offers &amp; K@@ ile ; for more commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted surrounding commands , a quick overview of the surrounding environment can quickly be lost . this command locks the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups defined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that match those from the Edit area .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the shar@@ pen@@ ed bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closed bracket .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the cur@@ ly cl@@ asp of a &amp; tex group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted , welded groups enth@@ eses can quickly get lost sight . this command locks the last modified group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not die . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple reference marks are used as man@@ ners . for the purposes it is used , the character is used in &amp; K@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two simple suits . &quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; knows this case and provides two locks for lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of double suits can be set up in the file ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used with specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and thus German or French reference marks . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; pressing Shift ; En@@ ter &amp; K@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e. g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , it is not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a table environment , t &amp; K@@ ile closes ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments .
some users want to assign columns in tables environments and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other .
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already a good source code completion , it has been added to &amp; K@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for lat@@ ex ; ) , there are three different modes . all these modes can be set up for different working modes under Settings K@@ ile ... can be stopped . &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and will be gr@@ aci@@ ously enlarged . on the other hand , the list may also shrink by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed when selecting a command . alternatively , snap marks can be inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by modi@@ fying br@@ anding marks and the desired parameters can then be inserted . &quot;
&quot; settings K@@ ile ; setup ... K@@ ile ; can be done to make adjustments to these lists . there can be different wi@@ re@@ ader@@ boards for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands , as well as win@@ ches of general language use can be selected . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not useful for execution of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered , and the execution mode calls for a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; K@@ ile ; a special mode for completing environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the execution mode over the manipul@@ ated area or the key / key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically inserted and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the environment can be continued in the easiest way and by pressing the button key . &quot;
&quot; once this has been done , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; K@@ ile ; det@@ ects that it is a list environment , a first \ \ item command will be executed automatically . &quot;
under Settings K@@ ile ; setup ... K@@ ile ; can be done to make adjustments to these lists . this mode uses the order list of the order mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; support custom lists of inter@@ ferences , which can be replaced immediately by longer strings . the lists can be set up in the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word ver@@ acity mode over the menu performs complete abstr@@ action or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt empty key , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large e @-@ mail books are not helpful for automatic retri@@ eval . however , it has been found that many wi@@ pers in a document are written more than once . this provides &amp; K@@ ile ; the comprehen@@ sion for all already written wines . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the file &quot; &quot; K@@ ile &quot; ... &quot; file can be termin@@ ated . here the threshold can also be specified for displaying the execution . &quot;
&quot; the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ ile / complete / mode / the Persian Home folder . it is abbrevi@@ ation ( Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the graphics incorporate images as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and re@@ ordering of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script tools and then converted to ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to be able to examine the results of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed together in the creation comp@@ iling , creating change and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or another conversion can be used by using Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file converted into a PS file and can be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the Quick Finish command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no one @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open every time . &quot;
a new project is planned for the project new project .... here the following information is available for the project :
&quot; when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ e@@ r project file . &quot;
the Script function of &amp; K@@ ile ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed by scripts in the vertical bar .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = K@@ ile ) has the following methods : &quot;
&quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system , in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a lot of different aids to support the user . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ Live ; supplied with many documents . included are a documentation for the included packages and another lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but it is ideal for the search for a certain format@@ ting . as this is a very large document , it is divided in &amp; K@@ ile ; it is divided into three important reads . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; K@@ ile ; only the results will be displayed .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; K@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source editor that can be found on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; K@@ ile ; is also part of the Fink project whereby &amp; K@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; can be found on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X .
&quot; many thanks to those who strive for the continued existence of the &amp; K@@ ile ; and for many hours , we strive for the development of tools that we all can use with regard to the &amp; GNU . &quot;

&quot; &amp; sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different sign@@ atures for e @-@ mails . with the command @-@ line interface , you create random signature or day sign@@ atures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the sign@@ atures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; . &quot;
&quot; for random signature , any signature is selected from the signature file of &amp; w ; by many sign@@ atures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily sign@@ atures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read . for each day you use different sign@@ atures , as with random signature creation you create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you a lt ; blank signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . click on the &amp; lt ; blank signature ; and insert them in the lower section . Sig@@ nature example Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org http : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org http : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org &quot;
&quot; you can create as many sign@@ atures as you like . then you have a list of sign@@ atures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails private or professionally , there are always sufficient sign@@ atures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then in the menu Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red cross removal in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog box . here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the User defined button and enter the new option by pressing the key or key combination . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ ent ; 3.5 required . to attach sign@@ atures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature from the output of a command . &quot;

&quot; this application is expected to have a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the binary working folder , then let the current job folder be attached . if not , then remove the selection of current job folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , anyone who has already worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how useful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the currently opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply let the current job folder be selected . if not , then select the current job folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already checked , it is already checked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then release the current file simply . if not , delete the file in the current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is formed , check the well @-@ formed check option . &quot;
&quot; for using a DT@@ D ; , specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the definition UR@@ I ; specify the definition UR@@ I ; in file selection is required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL , processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then leave the current file simply . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file choos@@ er file . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should have named , on . the file is usually stored in its home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; upload , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this will allow the plugin system to benefit immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the plugin in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . more details see below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or part , we start with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to ad@@ minister all the plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plugins without a location are used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project involves several persons in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports speci@@ fying team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project project properties dialog .
the name and email address are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nickname and serves as a unique identification .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can look for himself from the list of the team members who he is . this happens by looking the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button as pressed . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) appears fat after which you are : text .
nickname and setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for more information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another benefit by recording the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the drawing of the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone is working on it , or a script that plays a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project , etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Settings dialog allows events to be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email is sent to the address data selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
remarks are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note that note is simple . it can either be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ otation key@@ word in a commentary box followed by note text .
&quot; comments can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax is @ ann@@ otation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , where top name is the nickname of the team member . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles are independent of b@@ ump@@ y or lo@@ wer@@ case , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and supported web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are handled , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up using settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over a few pages that are dealt with one another .
&quot; the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags , including auto @-@ completion , can be changed with it . entries are : &quot;
&quot; large / Sm@@ elling of Tags : large / Dep@@ reci@@ ation of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lower case , the tags are inserted as inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / b@@ ump@@ y of attributes : large / b@@ ump@@ y of automatically inserted attributes . normal bulk / lower case means , the attributes are inserted so as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional Tags automatically close : when attached , tags for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; not optional tags automatically include : as above , for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; starting and exp@@ ending day automatically Update : if enabled , the corresponding closing day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
Auto @-@ setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in corresponding enco@@ ding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ at@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . restoring default specifications can be restored using button standard .
standard character enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be b@@ yp@@ assed ) . this setting is separated from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized .
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; create regular backup copies , so that during a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in an own view ( or the documentation in a box ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
set the default window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the UI gets confused by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / dependen@@ cies of views . it corresponds to the --@@ default layout command line parameters .
the warning message area serves the control of the possibility to disable al@@ erts by hooks of non @-@ queries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL . it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the PL@@ - and the source view in shared mode . see the different modes .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be adjusted in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structural tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such in which no element was found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; short@@ cuts are divided into groups , each may be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P &apos;s . abbrevi@@ ations are valid in groups , each may be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ clause canc@@ er@@ ates something different than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plugins are Part @-@ applications of third page , which can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ capable application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following should be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the related folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; load the component in &quot; &quot; read @-@ only &quot; &quot; mode : check whether the plug @-@ in is denied the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the input is correct . selecting this is also possible if the plugin is not available at the moment but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; since version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been developed completely new . the support for the built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept has been implemented , which allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for using &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in@@ serts . &quot;
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; when a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left @-@ hand corner .
&quot; a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
&quot; a view , in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger , appears normally in the lower dock . &quot;
&quot; depending on the de@@ bu@@ gger &apos;s supported functions , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action will connect to de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it divi@@ des the plugin to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action is set by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen Session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the noise according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output view .
&quot; displays Deb@@ ug@@ ger to start exec@@ uting the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently extended line . if this happens while the script is stopped , execution starts . if it happens before a de@@ bug report is started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; displays the de@@ bu@@ gger using the execution of the script , without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution starts when a request is made . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , without going into the functions or includes . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , and if possible into functions and includes it is failing . &quot;
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction and go to the next , as if there were the current ones . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set . &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g to be found at http : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us to your needs and how you can help and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to get better .
&quot; editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as CSS ; they enable and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script language and / CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the script language and / CSS ; . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create tag@@ x@@ ml files , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bar . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ di@@ alog@@ es , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day shows . the file lists enable quick inser@@ ting of tags into a document without any risk of a typ@@ o . &quot;
tag folders are nothing but folders . they only contain the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bear the name of the description language and version that exists . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is wise to use as many as possible so that other users have a better view and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing as a single element type about itself . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 )
only valid for the class class . the base class name for this class . ( family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
&quot; yes , the day has an common Attri@@ bute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only Family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it sets the name and type of attribute . additionally it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
prints the source texts used for filling in the tag editing dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ Name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that groups the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
defines the position of a tag in a dialog . this tag can only occur for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the tag to define . this element is a single element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but watch out &amp; lt ; Note . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tool is dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear with simple instructions to follow . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available yet . currently , the verification takes place only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . &quot;
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt;
&quot; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor for it , available via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited by di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; version = verse 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as a nickname .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; the key symbol assigned to this action . by clicking the User defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the current short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action this text is inserted in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which can change the document or use ( or parts of the document ) , started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; self are the quick start dialog or the various see in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : sh / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; script at the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we are replacing the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script inputs from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the standard input . input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output . it can be specified what to do with the text written on the default output , by setting the value of the output field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create its own tool@@ bar . in any case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
&quot; fill out all necessary fields , and add them to the matching tool bar the day . &quot;
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; Edit day &quot; when available so that an input is possible when using the action . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it , before we have difficulty . &quot;
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Next Programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D ; . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the day start , that is , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least sign@@ alize a message to the user , that clicking on this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it still has to be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the saved icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some common and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the tool@@ bar , or you should set them to a better overview by some separ@@ ators in multiple groups . &quot;
&quot; I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( to the top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the tool@@ bar to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how the separ@@ ator supports group@@ ing . someone , who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by examining all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; secure in the right folder . after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be placed in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their file description ( s ) to be loaded when a file is opened by the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most not@@ orious extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you might check in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for format@@ ting / script / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Official Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html ... &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Cont@@ ext@@ List = func@@ 1 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP documentation ; documentation something like this : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Contents = Langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub @-@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of chess ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
remember that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is shown ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Resources files .
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to display context sensitive help . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help , documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the contex@@ tual list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
&quot; now you can simply save your do@@ cr@@ c file and go to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then , create a folder ( like you stated in your do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation is used at the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the different resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or else to whom . at various points there is an email sending menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resource can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only made available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication , so that the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , the input fields have to be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start the upload . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , up@@ loading tool@@ bar tool@@ bars , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and sign@@ alling . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource correctly signed , a message appears with the statement of the author of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages , which is currently not written by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there &apos;s the easiest way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and the conversion of DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which is to be used . after that , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target Directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defin@@ i@@ tions@@ Line : the string you want in ! Doc@@ type Tag as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , bring &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after the conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; therefore , one must first famili@@ arise oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter temp@@ ts them to bring these concepts close to them without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to back up different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply , this is the most restricted size . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the Edi@@ ting Pan@@ e , the Bau@@ man@@ sions , the Fiel@@ ds of Information and the Tool@@ bars . please suggest , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the box by right @-@ clicking to get a contex@@ tual menu with the current document , like closing the current , other , or all map leaders , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click on the editor area leads to another context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cutting / paste / paste ) , editing the tag under the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editor window , the tool bar of the editor is present . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs . &quot;
&quot; if you want to insert the data for this just inserted tag . if you want to insert the data for this just inserted tag . if you want to insert the data for this just inserted tag . if you want a tag that has several attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in various fields in a dialog . &quot;
&quot; the Bau@@ man@@ page@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open it and strip them . in the presentation with file managers are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation constructions . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website , etc . all possibilities are open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used . the category depends on the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate users and templates in projects can only be used in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the scrip@@ ting languages available . clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is set to the position of the element in the document . clicking on an element opens a list of commands related to navigation and refres@@ h of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other construction views . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can be changed . the entry system that is aligned to the content enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation of the web @-@ technology for your development . it can be downloaded pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder to a project can be added , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two kart@@ ing leaders at the bottom end of the window , can be reached using useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this controller shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all modifications to the DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this controller shows all errors in the up @-@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts executed , give all error messages ( such as there are ) in this window . &quot;
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command displayed . the cho@@ ise side of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar by e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they get a tool@@ bar in an email they can store them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other and load them !
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why design what someone else has developed ? it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted promotions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can increase almost every task . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for rapid web development , and has been quickly expanded to a well @-@ engineered editor with many powerful features . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;

&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , where the oldest entry is removed . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters for &amp; HTML ; description , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board into &amp; URL ; description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anch@@ oring tag . &quot;
switches the block selection to / off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; key .
go directly to a line number . this is very useful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages are issued !
search a string or regular expression in the selected folder . a sort gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
&quot; displays the message window or not . this is the window , where you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot;
training and switching of the problem repor@@ ter at the lower edge of the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you switch to the structural tree .
display the tool@@ bar to the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu sorted by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ spr@@ j .
displays a dialogue for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
search for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded another input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only stored in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
&quot; a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local , or project . &quot;
&quot; opening a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved by setting actions ... , or you will be asked while asking if you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this doesn &apos;t delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do so . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where anyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
load a DT@@ D ; that you or anybody else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
&quot; loading / refres@@ h the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no enti@@ t@@ lement in the global K@@ DE folder , the loading fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu item in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ref@@ using by means of tool@@ bar , if this day does not contra@@ dict the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plugins menu , the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on them . click the activated plug @-@ in to disable it . &quot;
select the syntax of the current file . the list of available translation schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of line ending identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate change@@ over between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes require time or un@@ coun@@ table graphics . recommended is the card @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
switches on the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog influence each application using the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser . &quot;
&quot; judge the behavior of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate , you will find details . &quot;
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar or add them and change sequences .
&quot; this should generate a help according to the m@@ aus@@ age environment , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and licensed , but as with every open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , since , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be set up with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties later . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to be entered , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ spr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ illustr@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol are used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if a project is started from scratch , it is impossible to hook up . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an accurate selection according to the good man@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that make your work easier .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to top , including files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; this can be selected by the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the options button . in this case , troubleshooting is described . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading profiles can be set up in the sub@@ window profiles ( see in ) , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by drag@@ ging your own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the team configuration window configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; event actions are executed when a previously certain event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details . &quot;
by default opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was open .
to open another project select project ... from the Menu Project or the Symbol Project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ spr@@ j as extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will automatically be saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , but the entries are missing open and open with ... in the right @-@ click context menu : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be blind@@ ed to prevent removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to programming . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary , and the rather un@@ secure password on disk storage option is not in question . &quot;
&quot; this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog , if you change your mind before up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many high loader profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the server &apos;s name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; ft@@ p ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it can not be easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . in a project there can be many views , i.e. by simply changing the view diverse files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved in the menu project or project tool@@ bar , can be saved , opened or deleted using the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar . &quot;
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own way of working .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best can be st@@ age@@ able via the tool@@ bar menu . usage and addition vary . adding tool bar is dealt with below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
&quot; the tool@@ bar and the symbols can be set either using context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the tool@@ bar ) , where you can remove other actions such as tool@@ bar , ren@@ ame tool bar , or set tool@@ bars , where you can specify which actions on this or other tool@@ bars are to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and set settings actions .. set .
&quot; templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code escal@@ es and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; templates are basically like a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . &quot;
some templates equipped with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use .
&quot; binary templates are usually inserted in documents by links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . more information on the template tree is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be written by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . &quot;
&quot; these templates are useful when not a new document based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File Add As template save as a template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at project templates under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click file As template store selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drag@@ ged with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; creating binary templates is simple : just copy the file into a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder to the right of the file tree or in the project files , select a name for the template and back up . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can present he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or link dynam@@ ically to &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or associate with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files submitted in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , click the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a sel@@ ector box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection will be blind@@ ed as soon as el@@ iter@@ ate attribute is inherited . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default , and fits all except the regular folders in the template . if a regular folder is configured , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you &apos;ll probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
allows leading or post text templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers by copying contents templates in a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
the V@@ PL editor works as follows : it downloads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ Page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
&quot; working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document , which &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the V@@ oh@@ and@@ rot of &amp; PHP ; source text . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL editor . to edit , it is still necessary to edit the source text editor . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except that at the same time the changes in both the source text editor and the V@@ PL editor are visible and the cur@@ sor is active in the source text editor and the V@@ PL editor . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL and the source text editor is configur@@ able via settings Qu@@ anta . depending on the choice of V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is : a small chip for fast hosts and a big chip for slow . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select the document properties . thus , the processing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL editor is possible . the document properties dialog will also be called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL editor . this can be changed : &quot;
met@@ a tags allow storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below .
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change to the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to insert an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button , selecting the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the cur@@ sor is possible , like in a word processor , by moving with arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted using the button or the removal key . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ ting of tags is done in the same way via the tool bar , as in the source text editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed e.g. if an anchor tag , enclosed with text , must be removed each other surrounding anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars like the tables Assistant or the Listen Wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will later work in the V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists need to be used . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for study style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the performance of the style template can be tr@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile it except &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db , compati@@ bil@@ ity@@ mode , orph@@ aned holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated . &quot;
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path@@ name . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded sty@@ list file name with relative path to the work@@ folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l is possible : &quot;
&quot; this command will be checked for a partial or total agreement with a name called my@@ QNA@@ P@@ cloud or a specified mode name . &amp; eg ; template agrees with any QNAP ME , which includes the template template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will be extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a desired stop point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically performed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stop points are re @-@ checked briefly after the start of each pass .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; the merger was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the ind@@ entation at many points . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was a lot of conflicts with mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed exactly within these lines . and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
&quot; also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful if two persons work independently of each other in a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and den@@ ies the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble when somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can simplify the typ@@ ing work by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 -@@ o Target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 -@@ o target folder
&quot; open dialog will enable manual typ@@ ing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; on the Fol@@ der folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders will be introduced . if a file is selected for A , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when mer@@ ging , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not essential to immediately set a output file . you can do this step later when saving . &quot;
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the same / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in open dialog , you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you only need to create two suitable files , load them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and compare the relevant sections . &quot;
note : currently you can do nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only drop the text into a comparison window .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Any Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse a while over the line . then a small help window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three spring fingers are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed using the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful , if you compare three files . this is good in the next section ( Merg@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. white characters are relevant only in strings and comments , for pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no rows . when the line break is activated , the line is scored in broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Change &#93; when you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually . &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the line will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed .
&quot; this is just a wild@@ card for the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text appears not in the final stored file , nor in any marker you may copy and paste it elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; conf@@ lic@@ ting , but appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . carefully proceed with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if the sources ignore the options or ignore Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ating is mainly used with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys on the left , right , high , down , side up , end , end , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ B as you can also be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the auction window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using the Insert button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the Merg@@ ing section and explained the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l image up@@ side / C@@ tr@@ l image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts can be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the cli@@ p@@ board to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . &quot;
the options and the list of most recently used files will be automatically saved during the end and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences will be displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen type@@ face does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , the respective number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab button . otherwise , a tab character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press input or return , the return of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is checked , each selection will be copied automatically to the cli@@ p@@ board . manually copy to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
&quot; the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are ignored . in this step , white characters will not be ignored . even when mer@@ ging , white characters will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart track \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others only save a line delay ; however , if this option is checked , this option must be disabled . during mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still indicated , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic res@@ h@@ aping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before jump to the next un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
automatically tri@@ ggers all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important .
&quot; these options are dealt with in the chapter on the scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . see for details , see documentation for the comparison and merge . &quot;
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended to Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original . if you already have such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original , it will be deleted without any further backup . &quot;
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not concern the current running program . you must stop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart so that the change is active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally over the control centre . )
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; a short reference appears on the selection fields for coding , which is the local enco@@ ding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust file enco@@ ding for source files . this affects how special characters are handled and interpreted . since coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different enco@@ ding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding should be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be handled with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the code of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may only see the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you &apos;d prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just send out the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you see the differences and then decide ab@@ rup@@ tly to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as pres@@ et names for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that fits exactly your needs . you can use this function , for example , to cut distur@@ bing parts or correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first handed over to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is only used during the line interval . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . any input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program that themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this command line for line devi@@ ations to convert capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ul@@ ary expression that refers to the found text in the first quarter note . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line balancing . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted . &quot;
sometimes you may want to perform several sub@@ stitu@@ tions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions . example :
&quot; instead of sed you can use something else such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever are some details unlike sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the leading &apos; \ \ &apos; example : &quot;
&quot; the data according to the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for viewing and mer@@ ging , and the further operations only change the data that the new@@ spr@@ inkl@@ er al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m looks . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you are using a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ balancing pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal Pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes lyrics or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroying important data . &quot;
often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting
... can simul@@ ate the merge and display simulated changes without actually carrying out them ;
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog .
&quot; when three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as a base . if no target folder is specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start the merge , select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files will be listed that have been compared until then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is completed , showing &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left ... &quot;
&quot; each file and folder , found during the scan , is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is normally shown folded . you can double @-@ click a folder by double @-@ clicking on + / - , or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right . &quot;
&quot; if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed of problems of this type again . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot;
&quot; for identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color .
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red becomes red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. when A is a folder and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. when A is a folder and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the Synchron@@ ization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder are specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized active . then , select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for output file only B ; copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B by A. )
&quot; when two folders are merged and select the new file instead of mer@@ ging ( unsure ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical . &quot;
&quot; when mer@@ ging , a file is processed after the other . you status column shows ready when mer@@ ging was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and check if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will show further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts only appears when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odd ) , or all entries at a time . if you have selected all the merge actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not have a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ folder merge mode , C will be used as the target , and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries in the destination folder should also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
&quot; to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current item , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if due to conf@@ lic@@ ting file types still invalid merge actions , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options , simul@@ ating and Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see what would happen without the real changes , you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select / continue the directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , an appropriate dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; continue its work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to try to skip the cause of the problem . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been combined individually , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them once again . even if the merger has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered to be dealt with . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 settings menu ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders won &apos;t have to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many auto @-@ generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this can be set folder @-@ specific with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a leading point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to folders : if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare big folders using a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the chan@@ ges@@ et and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you some degree of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; similar to the date of change , no real comparison takes place . the files are considered identical if they are equal . for example , this can be useful when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging will be selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also , the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , copying the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because the knowledge is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced by another , then the original version will be renamed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ original extension , it will also be deleted without any additional backup . this option is enabled by default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder @-@ merge view remains visible to the merge of individual files ; you can switch to the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch to the main window in the window menu and switch between directory and text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you can also merge a single file directly without having to run the folder merge . once you save the result , the status will be set directly and the file will not be merged again when you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be considered :
&quot; a path can be relative and . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spac@@ e- &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . there is a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished , if a link is pointing to a file or folder . then a file is always accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit permission or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ als of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part view from the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
&quot; normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch will restart the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ el ac@@ compli@@ ces ) exist already . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not told the configure script to K@@ DE . in the default configure , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE may not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this subject . &quot;
&quot; if similar lines appear next to each other , this story is more often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor notes every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file , and it is too much effort to design a separate file format that could save this information . &quot;
&quot; so far , the effort was too great . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger amounts of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c lin@@ ated ; and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using , and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ DE on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the latest changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; um &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; because &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should not have trouble while comp@@ iling . if you still encounter difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of them . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) to the cli@@ p@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marking .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you have to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries are displayed , the differences show . this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines already exist , they will be removed when clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a thumb@@ nail of all virtual desktop environments . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , finish it or move them . this works both inside a working area and in several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual desktop environments as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to the other .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a working area and on other desktop environments . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only has the two entries p@@ ager . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , you can move windows within the warehouse ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktop environments . &quot;
&quot; when this field is enabled , the name of the virtual desktop is displayed . &quot;
&quot; this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of the virtual desktop . if it is shown together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st Desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the warehouse ; otherwise only empty work@@ tops are displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classic leaves &amp; p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , all virtual desktop applications appear in a horizontal row , which is very good for the display side on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ ature program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , view and move the windows as icons or with its contents . in addition , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select Switch to set Switch ... lets you set the dialog settings .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have write permission for the file , you must login as user root and assign it to your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for various users : artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ments are interesting : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ments . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly extended with new functions . it is optimized for use on performance @-@ weak machines . &quot;
&quot; when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . &quot;
&quot; the default setting increases &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a movable magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can display a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( select window mode ) or the mouse @-@ display area at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard node ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mou@@ se@@ poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the Shift , push or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the drop @-@ down window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is moved . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , store it into a file , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops updating of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short@@ cuts to save files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document once again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Lo@@ op@@ ers &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use a magni@@ fier , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people from use : from research or artist to web designer or visual impair@@ ments . &quot;
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / K@@ mag ( enter either this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / K@@ mag ) .
&amp; magni@@ fier ; was developed by Olaf Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ midt @ k@@ de@@ .org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are sar@@ ang @ user@@ s.@@ s@@ f@@ .net and Michael For@@ ster for@@ ester @ f@@ mi@@ .@@ uni @-@ pass@@ au@@ .de .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the cur@@ sor squ@@ ires for a while on the same spot . it &apos;s meant to help people suffering from the R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which every mouse click brings pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is at the same place . it &apos;s meant to help people suffering from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and can em@@ ulate pain every mouse click . however , this requires a bit of practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that arises when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can also consult a doctor if this is not done yet . &quot;
&quot; to clear it once again : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain that is caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement briefly .
&quot; move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . moving now the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; this residence time must be logged after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; execute a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if Intel@@ ligent shifting is switched on , the rotation speed shift time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here , the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , before it release the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse is carried out . &quot;
&quot; this moves are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt which will be started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a slider release sound buffer , which you can tune to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , it will start &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; start . this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation on G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , to find out how to launch a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the button , the settings are reset to the level after the last push of the user . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should leave you switched off . if you get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later take the smart shift . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse @-@ ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse @-@ ball . &quot;
&quot; first you need to take out the mouse @-@ ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear soon if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rollers . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily scr@@ ape with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart for@@ warding , that means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can execute yourself a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cur@@ sor to another . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to where you want it . however , you can &apos;t park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to have a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart p@@ anning is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . but it will probably only cause problems . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart shift when you just start using &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select text instead : execute a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while clicking the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will be played every time , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button hits a sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the intelligent shift without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; must be installed . this should be the case for most of the system . &quot;
&quot; the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available , if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up . &quot;
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activate the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is short . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and are causing pain .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a drag operation begins before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop with the mouse can also be performed . &quot;

&quot; &amp; mouth ; is a program , with which silent users can let their computer speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose phrases that should be spoken again from a list with the conversation history . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen photo ) , enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details see the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text@@ book . from the text passages , you can often choose text passages without having to type them . of course , the passages can be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right @-@ screen photo ) you specify the dictionary for the word tran@@ script . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can settle the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be recorded in the words of words . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially includes an input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the bottom white field in the screen photo ) and a circul@@ ating memory of the already spoken pro@@ positions ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth ; properly set , you can enter the sets you want to hear in the input field . each spoken phrase is attached to the flow memory . you can select phrases that should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , page wor@@ ding as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card card voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , specify the character enco@@ ding , with the text transmitted to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text forward . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on as default input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if this is successful , the other settings on this page are ignored . kt@@ ts@@ d Voice Service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in SV@@ N . selecting this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the menu of the text pass@@ book book or in the bar for text fitting books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of instant words , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and inserted in addition to the circul@@ ating memory . the chosen text passage will first be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second sel@@ ector box closing the editing window for text pass@@ age@@ book , you can specify if the text pass@@ age@@ book should be automatically stored when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; save the book . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book book will not be saved . &quot;
&quot; the page wor@@ ding contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word tran@@ script . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; using buttons to the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the drop @-@ down field . &quot;
&quot; select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply as@@ cer@@ tained by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , in order to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; this option lets you merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are brought together , and how they should be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you set up a new , empty dictionary without any entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary through time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two parts . in the upper part , the text @-@ pass@@ age@@ books are presented as a tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage or the associated keyboard . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new text passages , or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text segment is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected portions of the processor . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text segment is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected portions of the processor . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the circul@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; if this item is crossed , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is provided by default above the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and drag@@ ging , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar in the bottom part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text @-@ pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays is displayed with entries . the tool@@ bar is provided by default via the editing pane directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; you probably don &apos;t have the command for the voice output correctly or not fully entered . open Pre@@ ferences k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the card card . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge and without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently it supports only the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ eware folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ e@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to remove the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text to phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / ji@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / ji@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data must be enabled as default input .
the Voice Output D@@ äm@@ on von &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
&quot; because the setting of the language generator only takes place in the TT@@ SD , you just need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; adjust . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the &amp; k@@ mouth installation dialog ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , output text through the machine . a list of already spoken phrases is stored , which allows the user to spend over and over again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not include speech synthes@@ izer . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .

&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ zilla database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ats ; in the k@@ de @-@ accessibility mail@@ ing@@ list . you can also subscribe to the list via https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you need to install the speech disp@@ at@@ cher program and adjust properly . see also &quot;
&quot; for the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the board card is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card chart is displayed . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that vary in volume or speed . you should at least set up a speaker before you use it , since the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the default speaker . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the board leader in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the board card will be displayed . it will appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
&quot; all already established actors appear in this list . the preferred speaker will appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output , if an application does not present a speaker . &quot;
&quot; with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list to the bottom . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
&quot; on one of these buttons , click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; Desktop . &quot;
&quot; choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls &apos; voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ t . go back to the card list General and check if the voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de is started . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ t ; use to read text messages . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map leader tab to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; check this check box to activate the K@@ DE T@@ TS Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card will be displayed and you can read text messages and read . see . remove the marking , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and disable the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr termin@@ ates , runs &amp; kt@@ ats ; onwards , if the field is checked for voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears when reading automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the preview is complete . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can start , stop , pause , pause , pause and res@@ ume . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders are only shown when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map leader tab and tick the voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text which is to be read before . after a short time , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the text of a web page . you can skip this step too , but then many &amp; HTML ; header lines and other invisible stamps are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that is to be read , and select the text in the main menu . then , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fies you about events defined by you . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts ; read .
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . you can set up a message in which your nickname happens . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ notification differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it removes the tags br and b from the messages that send@@ mail sends , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is edited before it is sent to the speech disp@@ at@@ cher program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation in order to replace mis@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain lack of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ vers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of screen readers is read , the jobs stopped will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of warning .
&quot; News have the next highest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a web page , you can chat with &amp; k@@ mouth ; anyone who has just entered the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also messages . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text messages . every order you want from the card card is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text messages . text messages are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ats ; just one such reads , this output is stopped and stopped . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters work the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; strings replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ t ; is provided with pre@@ defined strings , such as : - ) by text or for re @-@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversations ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ duc@@ ers use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) around &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included are some X@@ S@@ LT file for translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML included .
&quot; with voice selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ t . if you have a female voice , for example , you can read about K@@ DE messages from K@@ DE . read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules are not applicable , it continues to pass the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the bottom . the processing by the filters is in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs are displayed . &quot;
&quot; for setting character tapes , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions than comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to be different from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text to the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ ase . the list is processed in the order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are app@@ ended to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here a language is entered , the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here . you can also select multiple languages when you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key pressed . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application id running programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers you have to leave . if for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copied . &quot;
&quot; if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string inser@@ tion filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . therefore , the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package ambig@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reached via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker that is set up on the board speaker , or to a speaker with certain features . you can , for example , specify that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ats ; there is a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression . ist on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can access this with a click on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the above filter conditions , the speaker will be selected that matches the desired requirements . click the button on the right to view dialog . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings , or delete all settings . &quot;
the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply to an entry in the Di@@ esen Filter case if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with the program@@ mer can give their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice @-@ output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice disp@@ at@@ chers via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d via the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; text of the text to read and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you can use .
&quot; open two &amp; console ; -@@ windows . just start kt@@ ts@@ d in one window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my speech . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my speech ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ forming filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone , so that SA@@ BLE will work at all . also , make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and found on the PAT@@ H environment variable . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors during the synthes@@ izer , so that whole pro@@ positions are ski@@ pped or only cow@@ or@@ ish . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the character enco@@ ding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a drawing filter filter . see . &quot;

&quot; speech Synthes@@ iz@@ ers , used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license that you find in the related documentation or on the web pages . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the k@@ de@@ byte pack@@ et with &amp; kt@@ t ; you can also find the source code from k@@ de@@ byte at ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page http : / / espe@@ ak@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es@@ .html . &quot;
&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
&quot; KT@@ TS works with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a console . &quot;
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or outdated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . see also on the site of kt@@ ats ; for information that is not yet included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend &amp; kt@@ t ; to use another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the XML conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; configure , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs package and the development files for the speech disp@@ at@@ cher program . &quot;
&quot; if you download the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts , purchase from the source archive for k@@ de@@ byte or download the currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before using &amp; kt@@ t ; first check if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer , and you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ t used . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed so that the application of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can go back , repeat the output , or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be chosen . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , look in . &quot;
&quot; when you click on adding or@@ ator to add a speaker to the list , or click Edit , the card reader facility will be displayed . for example , in the following the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PAT@@ H , you just have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character enco@@ ding for text that is handed over to Festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ats ; known , this setting is made automatically . generally , Western languages are ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and display this gray , the voice chosen by you does not allow these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or to click on App@@ ly ) . see . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed at kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as the K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the possibility to read or otherwise control the read . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders placed in the queue , along with the application which has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the straight edited sentence . the spokes@@ person ID corresponds to the column ID on the card board speaker . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can set the order in the list selected in the list below , pre@@ - or back . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) . &quot;
clicking on OK will take all changes to the settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; screen messages , warnings and messages will not be displayed . for more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts , see here . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled or kt@@ ops ; either without support for the corresponding audio module or kt@@ ops ; cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the speech speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % equ@@ als about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about the double normal talk speed . to enable these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; Desktop .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , choose Standard . &quot;
&quot; on this tab , you can set up special promotions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted from a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ t ; processes four types of speech contracts : &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ vers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the Screen Reader has been read , the orders received will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning will keep the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you can read a long text on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless welcome someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this board are only valid for regular text messages . for messages , warnings , and screen re@@ a@@ vers , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click on noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; check this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; disable noti@@ fications . if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and des@@ kt@@ t ; do not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , al@@ erts for which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nickname in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
use this drop @-@ down sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event happens . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . default select the speaker that will appear in the list on the board of the board as the top entry . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if for a particular event of a particular application an action is set , this will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the Event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can set the noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the button to load stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Er@@ ase . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains marks for controlling voice , speech speed , volume , gender , voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and bor@@ der@@ line recognition filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . thus , you can start or skip or pause the whole text on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer is not directly supported . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the set @-@ border recognition filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ t , a set @-@ border recognition filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add other set @-@ line recognition filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; in the simplest way , you will learn how to set up the microphone selection by trying out . switch off the subscri@@ ber selection and select text to read . if you choose to select the speaker , change some features and check how the speaker is selected . you must naturally have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; you can stop or cancel text messages on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set @-@ edge recognition filter is automatically set up if you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
character recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional boundaries ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set @-@ type recognition filter maintains the character set .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never used on &amp; k@@ de ; messages , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filter , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ t . &quot;
&quot; on the board of the card , you can over@@ write the voice settings for the application . the card card will be displayed if &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card board speaker ) . in other words : no subscri@@ ber features are defined .
&quot; if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ t . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ t ; the speaker that most likely matches the originally set features . &quot;
&quot; select the method to enter the subscri@@ ber properties , by clicking on one of the buttons . &quot;
&quot; if this property doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t give anything . &quot;
tick this check box if the property should have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set multiple mark@@ ings here .
&quot; because the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case in which you may want to specify the attribute language is before , if you know a particular application text is sent in a different language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the properties in the field speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default speaker and then use the speakers who are most likely to follow the following . &quot;
in this case 0 represents the last word order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it starts . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I do not get a tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and des@@ kt@@ ops ; it was stopped . probably you will need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved by this , you may need to install G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I stop using a text order , it freezes &amp; kt@@ ats ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message appears : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , please visit the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .@@ or@@ g. &quot;
&quot; I have downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I have installed them and can use them in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ s. / voices the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL , on which you found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be found via the PAT@@ H environment variable . some Synthes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive can offer a setting for speed even on the card card . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; default . ( this is because HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are quite courage@@ ous , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML converter filters , and set up the speech speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know that web pages are read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ats ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SA@@ BLE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . thus , the x@@ s@@ l file to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber die GEN@@ DER Tags . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a separate drawing filter and now I can go back or forth in &amp; kt@@ t ; no more sub@@ stitution will be displayed , the order is only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter . instead , use a filter for set @-@ edge recognition instead . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : check that the Stre@@ amer modules are registered by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts ; call the command line regi@@ sters . ( http : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; some users are experiencing conflicts with the audio output in connection with AL@@ SA . if your system is also part of it , you can &apos;t play music at the same time , and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set is still read . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the speech speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Debian users can install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; have &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar packed archive ) downloaded , log in as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
&quot; the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default , some of which have a run@@ time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; default is &amp; kt@@ t ; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination option . for example &quot;

&quot; before you use the synthes@@ izer , check first if your speech synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code from the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions in passing on . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you have to set the voice MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select a Cyr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) enco@@ ding like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . so choose the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option code must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option code must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ il@@ lic like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes on lex@@ ical Analysis and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates additional software to create this Di@@ phone . Festival produces this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; needed di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; in this process additional wr@@ apper code is added to Festival , to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA file files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA file , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found at &quot;

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for users :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; started . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting the network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed when installing and installing FreeBSD . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network setup module is loaded when the option network settings are selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this attempt to automatically detect the system used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is possible to select the platform from the list , which is best suited to distribution and ease of delivery . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system administration mode . before , all options are displayed gray , which means settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in system administration mode , you can enter the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the whole functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders : &quot;
the network interfaces are used to manage the system &apos;s network devices . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces :
&quot; the settings of the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device , in the list and clicking on the button ... in the Di@@ alogue System . &quot;
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings dialog to display the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are configured by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all the required TCP / IP settings at any system start . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected . &quot;
&quot; with the choice Manu@@ ell , without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP you can set the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field Network mask the sub@@ net mask is set . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; network devices can be enabled or disabled , depending on your needs . switching on a switched network device is activated by selecting the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; network devices can be enabled or disabled , depending on your needs . disable a enabled network device by selecting the list and clicking on the interface ... &quot;
&quot; determines the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which provides the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if more than one network interface is present on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain fee by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine calls http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS resol@@ ves this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 15.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; this list can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be sorted by selecting an entry and up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons Hin@@ ts or Her@@ below in priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ ing solution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ ing resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... &quot;
&quot; the list of known calcul@@ ators describes computer name to IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used during bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , completed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; usually , the list contains known hosts some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should be replaced in future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known calcul@@ ator and click Add ... Add new alias dialog .
&quot; enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known machine has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit ... The dialog of the named calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set . &quot;
&quot; the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code . &quot;
&quot; for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; install rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages with libraries and other things are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , and in the second section , all configuration files are discussed . &quot;
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about integrating the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently running with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found a wide distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to see it in the near future . this description is currently concentrated on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on the eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is able to use a valid IP address or , if available , DH@@ CP can be used . &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a reserved area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , so their use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , accessing the internet for such machines can be made possible by setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are usually used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own host ) . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed loop . &quot;
this part contains the configuration files affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes changed dynam@@ ically with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections you can find another content as defined there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is dropped by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape . the first thing was to create a surface for tar that offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing . the second goal was to answer a question my wife posed : how much longer does it take if you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; trains the tape back and reads the pr@@ elo@@ ad information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; do not recognize the pre @-@ tension@@ er on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ er , search for the right index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the Band@@ index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot;
everything went smoothly changing the symbol for the tape drive to indicate that the tape was included . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape .
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat ; by changing the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar , and the band can now be ej@@ ected without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band from &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; tape types must be form@@ atted before you can be used for storing data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting in &amp; k@@ dat ; this is done before you can format a tape before use . flo@@ ppy drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , but DAT drives do not need to be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , the volume continues , with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before hitting the backup process , you need to select the files to be si@@ ghted . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files entered in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the files and / or sub @-@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Sich@@ ern menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been introduced , the dialog will open for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings , the dialog appears backup . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
tick the files in one of the archives in the record for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the working folder for verification . &quot;
&quot; if you confirm the settings for verification , the dialog appears validation . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process and the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
&quot; before you can restore the restore , the files to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive , only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored . &quot;
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the files and / or sub@@ folders are restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the Rest@@ ore menu .
&quot; once the recovery process has started , the dialog will display settings for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you confirm the settings for recovery , the dialog will restart . this dialog shows the progress of restore process and data throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the tape inhal@@ er . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index in two ways from the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
&quot; the current working folder , where the backup should take place , automatically updates the list of files to be secured according to the currently selected working folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files that are located on the same file system are stored , such as the folder . &quot;
&quot; exec@@ uting an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used , only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
&quot; delet@@ es the snap@@ shot file before using tar . this causes all files to be saved , and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup . &quot;
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the K@@ D@@ at menu item ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ winding -@@ variant of the tape .
&quot; this setting is active , communicated &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is involved the command is loading to the drive . on some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the ej@@ ection from the tape drive . possibly this setting will not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , when releasing the release of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically dis@@ car@@ ded the tape . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy streaming . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware block size for tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must communicate the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where your name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the period when the tape has been form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are tar archive that can be managed directly with &amp; GNU , tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system logs . the program is designed for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system provides the various protocol files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is designed for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system re@@ stores the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users allow quick access to information about problems occurring on their server . therefore , try to provide some advanced features , which can be filtered and evaluated for certain programs using the protocol files . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 features &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen@@ shot , it provides &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , it attempts to open and k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open . if you don &apos;t have a small message window , you usually do not have access to system management privileges . the protocol files usually do not have permission to read for the normal user . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criteri@@ on or after entered strings . the list of log lines will now be automatically modified , so that only protocol lines will be displayed next to the filter . then , a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns . &quot;
&quot; you can , of course , select another entry at this point . the key@@ chain of the filter search term is then only matched to the entries selected in the corresponding column . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous colour as protocol lines of the level indicator . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off .
&quot; if you want to display only certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can disable the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can enable the Add new lines to pop up in the main window context menu to show all the new log lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. There you can find more information about the source code from &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling the program boot when running the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( for example because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to convert a machine to System V In@@ it , without a new installation and re@@ format . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also different from BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; system services do not include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; you can also use r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches in various places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one to find .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can manually edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and then fix it manually by re@@ boot the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
&quot; how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop , so you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line : &quot;
&quot; this would stop htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a run@@ level server running only htt@@ p@@ d , S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network etc . &quot;
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it shouldn &apos;t be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not speak tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to launch it on this level ( or stop it ) .
&quot; you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n , or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new area . to just copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and enter the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to add the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator key to activate the different work@@ spaces ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board with cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the required run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of DAT@@ EN@@ TR@@ US@@ TS , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
&quot; all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; I experim@@ ented with standard Run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine continually starts new . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; at the LI@@ LO prompt , enter lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in stand@@ alone mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) . &quot;
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to run under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , you must edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way system services in these distri@@ butions are launched , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary software programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution : please check if all configuration files are present , which are needed by the respective system ( and whether they are in the right folder ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) just exit without notice if their configuration files are not present or mis@@ configured . &quot;
&quot; the importance of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even vary from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user ; . &quot;
&quot; after you have made any changes , you need to save it . either you can use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or save the entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user group list . to edit select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings . only if you have set up space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings . additional card cards appear , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the password management board file appears , if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d , are installed like in BSD UNIX . &quot;
&quot; this card card will only appear if for at least one incorporated fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the restrictions in the space are given in KB : &quot;
&quot; these parameters can be individually set for each file system . the current file system is selected using the File System File System , with space limitation &quot;
&quot; the board card groups inform about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group , which belongs to the user , can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the Group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analog@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO System to add , remove and modify the boot password , remove and change the time to the boot of the standard operating system , remove , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more . &quot;
