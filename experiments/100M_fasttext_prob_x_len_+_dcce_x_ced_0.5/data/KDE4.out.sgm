<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera is then used as a disk drive. the camera can also be used via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivates. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">"& digijoined; uses the gphoto2 program to communicate with digital cameras. gphoto2 is also a free, redistributable software collection for digital cameras that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows to transfer images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use serial ports for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve the image in most cases, so use it before trying any further manual processing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions Normalize, settle, Automatic adjustment and contrast extend from the Corrigation Automatic correction menu attempt automatically to make your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminaire values across the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shading. this function is often a magical correction for images which are dark or well-washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it only produces trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destroying it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic balance: this method maximizes the color area in the red, green and blue channel."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast enhancements: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a restart of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">White balance from & digijoined; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"in case you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can do the white balance in rough mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm of the copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochbal. they launch it via the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side, both the original image and the preview of the target picture can be seen. the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original white balance again, it is enough to click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"the histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button, you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminous."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview, to use the selected color to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result displayed in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"the buttons save as and load exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set, you can store it in a text file and load them later."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences panel resets all filter values to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can adjust the coding depth per colour channel of the edited image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time, and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool can be found in the menu under color grading correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several colour channels to the same time, so you can use it for multiple photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner always need the same error and you will always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the gradation tool that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digitised; mold colour effects include four colour effects, a solar-ization effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, solar radiation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that resulted in a partially developed pressure of a short flash. the result was a partial negative image. the result was a partial negative image. this tool allows you to fine-tune this interesting effect."</seg>
<seg id="412">"intensity controlled by the solar ionization. at about 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliantly and glowing. try it simply; it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level Level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the thickness of the neon light.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be seen in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo in bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too great saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to increase saturation instead of raising it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool Toner correction is located to improve the exposure. even if the dialogue on this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of slider for the purpose explained here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, active channel or selected area. under the graphene, three sliders are clicked into into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">"the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the knob, and take care of how the picture changes."</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview is updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left hand side, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">"scaling: this selection box can be set to display the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear Histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic arrangement is more useful."</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the upper one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the middle tones, often called gamemones."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pinks can be used in previewing the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and light tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic alignment."</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and load: with these buttons, the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later. in addition, the Gimp Levels format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the Overexposure Indicator option controls all colour channels to view overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you will only see the effect only in preview, and there is no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left hand side, half of the original and the target picture is displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:"</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">"in addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images captured with a digital camera, linear mode produces a broad beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps."</seg>
<seg id="435">"for example, if you move a curvature to the right, for example, the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the associated image pixels become darker."</seg>
<seg id="436">"to preview the original photos, a red marker is visible. if you move this marker on the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste."</seg>
<seg id="437">"save as and load: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. each curve you created can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format is the Gimp curve format."</seg>
<seg id="438">"if you have this method and the three color pette buttons automatically generate the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curves."</seg>
<seg id="439">"the Overexposure Indicator option controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel you will see the combined result, i.e. you will see the effect only shown in preview and there is no effect on the final result."</seg>

<seg id="441">"the channel mixer of the & digitized; editing is a tool to improve colour channels, or change colour shades of the photos."</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">"with the channel selection box, you can select the colour for histogram: this gives you a first hint as you can correct the canals by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with one's own rider."</seg>
<seg id="444">"the preview of the target picture has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value."</seg>
<seg id="445">"controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels."</seg>
<seg id="446">"sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a colour leads to a visible roughness that does not appear in the colour channel. if that's the case, you can improve your Monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the colour space first."</seg>
<seg id="447">"save as and load buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later, and then load. the file format used is the gimp channel mixer format."</seg>

<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates, especially in dark areas, granular images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blurring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper look. actually, it doesn't sharpen it, it works rather psychologically. it works rather psychologically. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and it is protected by copyright by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">"the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more detrimental sharpness than normal cameras for home users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG images, a camera is often used for internal sharpening. images in the raw format have to be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a sharpening filter while reading the image. if you disable it, you will get the control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with sharpening sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="487">"in general, the most suitable technique for sharpening an image increases the sharpness of the edges. in general, the most suitable technique for sharpening an image is to refocus the tool. in general, you can focus more information and a comparison of all techniques to focus."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: one image is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool for softening using the menu entry Corrigation softening and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in radius or amount increases the effect."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore you should best sharpen pictures in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blotted image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swellvalue is a fracture from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference-sum. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference for a edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempt from sharpened and therefore plastic defects in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image is the (2). blurred was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitized; tool refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted extraction filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening pictures is the use of a blur mask. refocus mostly achieves better results than blurred. you can launch it from the menu by selecting colors in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular folding works much better than the Gauß 'sche Faltung. the Gauß' sche Faltung has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixules, which are far from the original pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures, the default value 1 should result in good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close 1, and eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful."</seg>
<seg id="502">"gauge's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß 's sharpness. if you use a value unequal, you should also increase this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal zero, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in matrib size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauge. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"the Save As and File Buttons will be used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set, will be saved for later and can then be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all the trimming, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations do not immediately visible changes that are not immediately visible, but which later leave inconvenient artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you click and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally blurred masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">"in theory, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better than the sharpness mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in handling small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original blended colour image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information about the methods of sharpening the image in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothness controls the blurring of the range that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can set it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool malfunction correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail Positioning p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a smooth smoothness over the image."</seg>
<seg id="520">"alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly into all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film grading or CCD noise, a high value is generated by a high value of wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothness factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothness. therefore set this value matching to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns higher structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going to run. usually here 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-increments da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be selected small. so be sure that small angles make a long runtime. so you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integrated step width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only small, but it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to let it out."</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and load exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"correction of image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and take a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation anytime with the Cancel button."</seg>

<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel is needed and can wipe the image."</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing to see luminance changes. if the value is too high the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubricate occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value enhances the filter response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or smoother tips may occur. if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts with no details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance density: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve one image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you change color or luminance to improve one image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gamma tolerances of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically smoother, but also contaminate the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"absorption: controls the alignment of phase jitter absorption. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of luminance. when it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high."</seg>
<seg id="542">"save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for noise reduction, which you have set, can be saved into the filesystem and loaded later."</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is tagged with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction was applied to the default settings.</seg>

<seg id="651">"golden mean: the golden center is a division divided into different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a nautilus shell or the petting leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we feel beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden pitch is the irrational number 1.618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks, which used to create your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>

<seg id="654">The golden center provides more flowlines when you put a picture together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third bar, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads to the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow on this way."</seg>
<seg id="656">"a further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to guide the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects. this can be just there without guiding the eye, it will fulfill its task."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the gold triangles are also derived from the above-mentioned golden spiral. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equivalent triangles. diagonal to place diagonals at these lines can allow a static object to appear more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"when you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles."</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal Flip and Vertical Options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the button color you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be rendered invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>

<seg id="853">"with this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM."</seg>
<seg id="854">"the conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original quotation from Him is: expect from dcraw not to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes, you get better results with dcraw."</seg>
<seg id="855">"first select the raw file to be converted and start the module. the raw image converter window then appears in the mode for a single image. with the button preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture."</seg>
<seg id="856">"you can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance. the essential parameters like Gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later."</seg>
<seg id="857">"a four-colour RGBG version can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera operates in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect."</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you're satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name stays the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes."</seg>
<seg id="859">"Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information on your image and uses the lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you plan to process your pictures frequently or later on, you should not select the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you select JPEG in memory format, the metadata contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adjusted your settings, you can start conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel to cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which is the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to automatically overwrite existing file. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>

<seg id="1044">"when you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling is adaptive-recursively; recursively, because each pixel is continuously partitioned and adaptive because the recursionstefe depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are monitored individually and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you switch on jitter, change & Povray; the rays by a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of the rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>

<seg id="1527">"in connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of code settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>

<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters you can use (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the calculator. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal but I (note of the translator: this means that the author is meant) am not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from receiving information publicly available on the & CD; so neither the artist nor the music company can be added any more, so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt."</seg>

<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127).</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard doesn't support a gun (e.g. with note 60), you can use a drum (e.g. with note 60), which sounds similar to a gun shooting. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shooting), it removes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the note 60, no matter which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that this is meant with the word drum patch, where each sound is a different percussionist (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 items."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">"the keymaps are mainly used to map tones to the percussion channel. for example, take a look at the provided keymaps."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map out some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, simply do this in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates, in which ratio pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, this is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM gives a keyboard that gets a pitch-Bender-Event with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two notes up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; around."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI-Map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under Settings, point MIDI settings."</seg>
<seg id="1678">"the channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos, you see which sounds are being played."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button does not lights more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views (up to now) to display the played tones. view the View menu in the Settings menu under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. this allows the same MIDI file to run on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can't force anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed and etc; you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2217">"working with the VPL; editor in a document, which & PHP; contains, a small green symbol shows the Vohandrot of & PHP; source text. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL editor. to edit, it is still necessary to edit the source text editor. there are no plans to change this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"the second mode works just like the first one, except that at the same time the changes in both the source text editor and the VPL editor are visible and the cursor is active in the source text editor and the VPL editor."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"the synchronization distance between the VPL and the source text editor is configurable via settings Quanta. depending on the choice of VPL, you can choose between synchronisation after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation is: a small chip for fast hosts and a big chip for slow."</seg>
<seg id="2220">"assuming you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select the document properties. thus, the processing of invisible tags at work with the VPL editor is possible. the document properties dialog will also be called when a new document is created with the VPL editor. this can be changed:"</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merger was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the indentation at many points. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was a lot of conflicts with merging."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed exactly within these lines. and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added."</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">"also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful if two persons work independently of each other in a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screen shot shows three source files when merging:"</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>

<seg id="2290">"differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble when somebody changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can simplify the typing work by writing only the filename of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Ordner2 kdiff3 Ordner2 kdiff3 Ordner2 -o Target folder kdiff3 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner3 -o target folder</seg>

<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in open dialog, you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you only need to create two suitable files, load them into & kdiff3, then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can do nothing from & kdiff3; only drop the text into a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.)

<seg id="2511">"first, you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again."</seg>
<seg id="2512">"when your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse-ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse-ball."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"first you need to take out the mouse-ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear soon if you look at the underside of the mouse."</seg>

<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"the solution for this problem is that you can execute yourself a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another."</seg>
<seg id="2519">"solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it. however, you can't park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to have a keyboard input. secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows."</seg>
<seg id="2520">"I try to work with the smart move, but I don't manage to edit text."</seg>
<seg id="2521">"the smart panning is an advanced function of & kmousetool, and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very well possible to copy it to the clipboard and execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. but it will probably only cause problems. here are some advice:"</seg>
<seg id="2522">"do not use the smart shift when you just start using & kmousetool; instead, select text instead: execute a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while clicking the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again."</seg>
<seg id="2523">"use the audible mouse click. this will be played every time, when & kmousetool; the mouse button hits a sound like a mouse click. later, you can use the intelligent shift without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"to use & kmousetool; to be able to use, the XTest extension for & X Window; must be installed. this should be the case for most of the system."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"the functionality of the audible mouse click is only available, if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up."</seg>

<seg id="2622">"to understand how filters work, it is important to know how the" speech dispatcher "program works with a text. & ktts; differentiates four types of texts."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"the output of Screen-Reavers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. if the output of screen readers is read, the jobs stopped will be resumed."</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will be continued after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">"News have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you can read a long text on a web page, you can chat with & kmouth; anyone who has just entered the room. & kde; notifications are also messages."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the rest are simple text messages. every order you want from the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text messages. text messages are intended for the output of longer texts, which do not have any special urgency."</seg>
<seg id="2627">"all four order types are processed in queues, except for the output of Screen-Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktats; just one such reads, this output is stopped and stopped."</seg>
<seg id="2628">"first, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen-Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text messages as well as on & kde; messages."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters work the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"strings replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktt; is provided with predefined strings, such as: -) by text or for re-formatting messages from & conversations; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form."</seg>

<seg id="2634">"each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter determines that its rules are not applicable, it continues to pass the text to the next filter."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"when a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the bottom. the processing by the filters is in the order in the list from top to bottom."</seg>

<seg id="2940">"& ksystemlog; is a & kde; -viewer for system logs. the program is designed for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system, or where the system provides the various protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is designed for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system, or where the system restores the different protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users allow quick access to information about problems occurring on their server. therefore, try to provide some advanced features, which can be filtered and evaluated for certain programs using the protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 features & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you see in the following screenshot, it provides & ksystemlog; functions available, with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, it attempts to open and ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open. if you don't have a small message window, you usually do not have access to system management privileges. the protocol files usually do not have permission to read for the normal user."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or after entered strings. the list of log lines will now be automatically modified, so that only protocol lines will be displayed next to the filter. then, a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can, of course, select another entry at this point. the keychain of the filter search term is then only matched to the entries selected in the corresponding column."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a more conspicuous colour as protocol lines of the level indicator. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only certain process (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can disable the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use the filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can enable the Add new lines to pop up in the main window context menu to show all the new log lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. There you can find more information about the source code from & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in the & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named) as & ksysv; This section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling the program boot when running the system in the & Linux; world. and this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (for example because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to convert a machine to System V Init, without a new installation and reformat. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init is also different from BSD Init, that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail; system services do not include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"you can also use rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in various places after the program init and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can manually edit / etc / inittab by hand and then fix it manually by reboot the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how does and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop, so you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a runlevel server running only httpd, Sendmail;, Network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it shouldn't be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not speak trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to launch it on this level (or stop it).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move scripts between Runleveln, or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new area. to just copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and enter the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to add the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently, there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tabulator key to activate the different workspaces (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runlevel, move it into the clipboard with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the required runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of DATENTRUSTS, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"all settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I experimented with standard Runleveln, and now the machine continually starts new. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"at the LILO prompt, enter linux single and press the input key to start in standalone mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; to run under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you must edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services in these distributions are launched, simplifies configuration for the proprietary software programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution: please check if all configuration files are present, which are needed by the respective system (and whether they are in the right folder). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) just exit without notice if their configuration files are not present or misconfigured."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of the & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even vary from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & kuser; to start, it is sufficient to read the chapter customization of & kuser;."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made any changes, you need to save it. either you can use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user group list. to edit select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings. only if you have set up space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings. additional card cards appear, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD-Unixes."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the password management board file appears, if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd, are installed like in BSD UNIX."</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this card card will only appear if for at least one incorporated filesystem space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, whereby the restrictions in the space are given in KB:"</seg>
<seg id="2996">"these parameters can be individually set for each file system. the current file system is selected using the File System File System, with space limitation"</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the board card groups inform about the group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group, which belongs to the user, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the Group's dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or group, select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analogously."</seg>
<seg id="3000">"with this module, you can install the LILO System to add, remove and modify the boot password, remove and change the time to the boot of the standard operating system, remove, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more."</seg>
