&quot; although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Brief , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who wanted to occupy the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges , who were interested in his interest . &quot;
I was imprisoned .
&quot; free after Method Man , &quot; I was as if it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the United States had only increased . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are , and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very secre@@ tive love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me how to deal with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain as one says so nicely . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks of , as a former colleague expressed it , and publicly explains his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted in favor for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won during the Repub@@ lican election , was the highest number ever reached by the party nominated by the party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not tune Tr@@ ump and his voters to the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme that takes people from all over the world , a deeply believing man with whom I talked about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; also , the l@@ umps of the world view did not correspond with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Suns &quot; at play .
&quot; m@@ umps In@@ tolerance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced with Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who lived for the environment for her lifetime , and Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still adap@@ ts to the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with lots of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise advice helped me much in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love toward America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump made his way to the nominated repub@@ lican candidate candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , pres@@ ided over a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
the debate with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared his racism and fan@@ atic@@ ism or because they were willing to over@@ look those things broke me almost the heart .
perhaps it &apos;s unfair to call the tr@@ ump voters as rac@@ ists .
&quot; to arrange people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and indicates a in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes are not taken into account in their congreg@@ ations .
&quot; could it be that those voters , most of whom know , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m. d . Ü ) : as much as &quot; &quot; White against All Other Eth@@ ni@@ cs &quot; &quot; ; word play from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , as much as the great Van Jones means , has killed exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nonetheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have , America is welcome to everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ ney , his story as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps there is a huge part of the White Americas on this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , had my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd replied with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ ared the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ umps Country , said the news . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find any place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love of music by rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; the Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra from Cat@@ adv@@ a , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC . &quot;

&quot; what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the O@@ ax@@ aca province , together with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of Cat@@ eur@@ a ? &quot;
&quot; the music played at both venues not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists , but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now the La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community that is located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces is known for its abuse and the violence of gangs .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and offered youth such a rare hop@@ el@@ essness .
&quot; the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laugh@@ ing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the h@@ ust@@ le you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , wood@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from waste
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays Capital , on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ generated instruments , composed of local solid waste materials , is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and drums , all made out of rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of Cat@@ adv@@ a , rec@@ alls the early days : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach in the same place where parents worked in the garbage . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
that changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin @-@ made violin .
today there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments of recycled material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic land@@ fill sites ) records the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tonnes of waste every year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in Cat@@ adv@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring drama of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played music even before Pope Francis :
these eastern afri@@ can countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing

&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for joint use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was then known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it looked at the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal off@@ ense of this kind on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to take one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it did not succeed in catching fish there .
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million in Liberia due to lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crossed criminal proceedings and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the NGO stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( underground fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister out of their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; with this , we have eight countries who are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust , En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers technical support F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate ab@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once imp@@ eded by bureaucratic obstacles and also by the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries circul@@ ated , the actions now happen in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there the individual countries can exchange existing licenses for example , news about suspic@@ ious activity or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i closely monitors the activities of ships , when they move on the open sea , via satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas , such as suspic@@ ious cru@@ ising routes , such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such tests can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a pen@@ fre@@ ader . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , on the basis of this information , may refuse to accept such ships in their ports . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pun@@ ishments , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to reg@@ ain estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue , which will lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to illegal fishermen entering Eastern African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also illegal fishermen .
&quot; their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit licensing , indication of fanta@@ sies , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately util@@ ise the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ brid@@ led control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; You dar@@ ed not run my port &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the closed front is working . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspic@@ ious vessels . &quot;
it has un@@ covered criminal networks that had shared fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found refuge ships .
&quot; due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to accurately detect suspic@@ ious vessels .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and we try to cross this , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tr@@ acking , an NGO , which also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers technical support F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find criminal acting vessels with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team can indeed influence the global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , together with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana marine protection organization , Sky@@ Truth has launched the Global Fishing Tour platform : a platform that offers satellite data , and the position of every single tr@@ ack@@ able ship worldwide can be displayed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; join our neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what they are doing - this simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project where a global system permits the pursuit of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
ships which used to be fishing earlier without a license and hardly had to deal with consequences now know that they are observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since fishing boats have purchased more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found the inspec@@ tors on board tow nets where they were forbidden . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars will disappear every year by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; six countries have joined forces in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . . &quot; &quot; security is the goal of leaving even more such initiatives and structures even in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia could report his first big triumph : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was travelling under false flag . &quot;
&quot; the ship has also entered into forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the conduct of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works across the entire world sea .

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the Venezu@@ el@@ as government rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on the issue of office , Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness , by hanging on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : Venezuela &apos;s return order ) , images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country , among others in the flat land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des @-@ Regions Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , located in the central part of the federal state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a , on Is@@ la Margar@@ ita . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deterior@@ ating , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute shortage of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition faced a fundamental change in the resum@@ ption of the current president , Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but in the end the re@@ election of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ ari@@ zes the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and profit margins are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine is the only way to rec@@ ap@@ ture the country &apos;s institutional structures and to adopt a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( e.g. : round Table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together , urged the demonstr@@ ators to continue their campaign against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . &quot;
&quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among others , as follows : &quot;
&quot; it is so far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nation @-@ wide civil strike and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores palace . &quot;

&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time are witn@@ essing among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also con@@ front@@ ations with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures that talk about con@@ front@@ ations , as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
especially large waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves , according to their own statements , against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ State of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise one could see something that many national gar@@ den@@ ds do not have ! &quot;
meanwhile an info@@ graphic is already making the turn that forms the scale of oppression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a ten@@ ure issue - this has now been proven in the eyes of many people by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ ek Media Labs found :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the sign@@ atures are fake .
here is your removal !
on the road !
&quot; others regard these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government , which , from its point of view , has taken a little against the devastating economic crisis and is rather busy paraly@@ sing critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are increasingly taking on frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to take part in a strike instead of working or shopping .

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was written on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to visit the atro@@ cities of La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera Process in the province of Córdoba , against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not look for his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept the secret of family secret .
&quot; in the situation back then , I believed that was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and killer . &quot;
&quot; Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the Order &apos;s intelligence department in La Per@@ la from 1976 to 1978 . &quot;

&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who spoke before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power has a parent in his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have friend with one of the ERP systems . &quot;
&quot; pass just that they do not ent@@ ail you one day , and I have to save you . &quot;
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , a Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the sports hall again . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
he told me I would become a secret agent .
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation , I thought that would be fine . &quot;
on the military base I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ Here the prisoners are tor@@ tured
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in which cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - were all possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver in it . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen items were put off and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I se@@ wed in and saw a couch that people were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the person &apos;s body that was just tied there .
&quot; they often bind a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ threw him with water and ch@@ ased him cargo from 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty win@@ del .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget that smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much pain to another ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with cu@@ ffs and were brought to eye band@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i , Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying face down - all were tied at hands and feet .
&quot; near the entrance , people squ@@ atted quietly on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why did you get me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero made a man there and killed a man .
&quot; according to the survivors of the civil society Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted at the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina were indic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of La Per@@ la Memorial , by the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way to which the kidn@@ apped come here .
&quot; if you look at the map , you will see that they took this road and were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ izing .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war @-@ prey &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war prey &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was at the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war yield was a bay@@ on@@ et , or perhaps military points , that one took off an enemy that was fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the fridge , the record player , clothing , painting , money ... then that is not war prey , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the head of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered : and you , who st@@ ole the cars on the road ? &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you personally . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do so !
so my father was .
I have not a single good memory of him .
&quot; as I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll collar shirt from wool . both my father from La Per@@ la had both . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothing back home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence of me accused me of being a conspir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay my burden on what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; when you first have children , one realis@@ es the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I went even so far to say :
&quot; well , so , during the dictatorship , you executed people . but why did the cor@@ p@@ ses leave ? &quot;
why children kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself again and again : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have simply put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was just decided to kill these people , but why their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not have families to whom one could pass their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that can be done to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re @-@ established , they fet@@ ched machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were cr@@ acked and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people !
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot;
the thought of showing my father was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him alleg@@ ations of all the atro@@ cities I had to witness .
then he said suddenly : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly gra@@ ded and asked myself , for which all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something about me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed horrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
he answered only &quot; Na then show me . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I got the first advertisement . &quot;
finally I realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can repro@@ ach me that I &apos;m bi@@ ased . I have finally said against my own father .
&quot; Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest , standing still at the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , torture in 98 particularly serious cases , torture followed by subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old . &quot;

the jud@@ gments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence in Spanish .
&quot; after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; in 28 cases , the Court suspended life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of the original 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gement : murder , tor@@ turing and rape by officers . # Es@@ War@@ State terrorism &quot;
&quot; all def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian personnel . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the court judgment is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization founded in 1995 , H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , representing the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research was carried out for 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial , which is now led by human rights organisations . &quot;

a translation error makes older people go to &quot; fear@@ some drivers &quot; in Kyoto
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto in which one can extend its driver &apos;s license .
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long their driving license , last month witnessed a very mis@@ used translation . &quot;
&quot; in a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; means that &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; means wrong@@ ly - but perhaps also with evil h@@ amm@@ ers &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads from 1 to 20 September in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; adaptation of Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos , which was widely shared in social media . &quot;
&quot; the error was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also the one who atten@@ ds the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n Daily Newspaper wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , though gram@@ m@@ atically not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture exc@@ used for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt off@@ ended by the inadequate correction ( the translation ) for our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News continued to deal with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan , and wrote : &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an inadequate description of older drivers . according to the police , the percentage of older drivers , who are involved in accidents throughout the country , is a cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents of sen@@ iors were caused in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors had 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period . &quot;
&quot; the repor@@ ter named in particular brought comments on the light published in the Yahoo release of the article , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seemingly s@@ way against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo on the translation error has among other things the following comments :
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible motor@@ ist &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot;
&quot; ( users View@@ ing this Forum : 2 ) 3,@@ 8@@ 64 6@@ 19 Happy Birth@@ day New@@ by ! ! ! &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to translate it , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and to transmit active language skills in order to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that trans@@ lators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ English as their mother tongue , who could translate the translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; however , some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations themselves internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ ding and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences , which are produced by mechanical translations , show that this technique can &apos;t replace any human trans@@ lators for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling over@@ prints , which often ad@@ orn t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery or at least harmless . however , by large companies or by the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto is hoping to use a reliable source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ orship on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
later other users wrote that the Internet pages of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
&quot; other online broad@@ cast@@ ers contributed recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups that contra@@ dict Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s government . &quot;
&quot; the protests started at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a trac@@ er@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was c@@ apped , and advised the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to gain access to the Internet . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an Provider are once again locked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
&quot; offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been reluc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations as the Commission saw it as a &quot; call to force . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I have registered to @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again . &quot;
it is astonishing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ in@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions . &quot;
&quot; earlier research conducted by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server requests certain domains correctly . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds correctly or ref@@ uses to request such a website . &quot;
&quot; we acknowledge a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third sealed channel , was suspended on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transferred the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was det@@ ained . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans more and more difficult to access multi @-@ media coverage of current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other crimes , just as they have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the shor@@ tened version of a short report by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que CA@@ EN &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , Lost Schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family she lived there .
&quot; shortly before gradu@@ ating from the university , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was proud of her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one that has become somewhat , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , one design@@ ates the more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this in the context of a contract that cannot be lifted . &quot;
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
&quot; after finishing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testimony , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the Cri@@ adi@@ ta guarantees in general silence . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who has their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , can improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who receives the girl with her and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education , and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience it only a few years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the so far unknown phenomenon , which takes place in sec@@ rec@@ y in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of severe blows . shortly thereafter she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the budget of the former military family Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who worked as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small place with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra hit a pole on Mar@@ ín until she suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they emphasized that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNIC@@ EF and Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela laid down the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and called for &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained . &quot;
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children un@@ punished .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations requested a prompt investigation into the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta to 30 years imprisonment .
&quot; when the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín will be directional - for the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ays a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes before court . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when her father worked with her father and her father lost his job .
&quot; their brothers now had to work all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market , in order to make money . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time in such a way that you still have time to learn . &quot;
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
&quot; for instance , she clean@@ sed the fridge , plast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to go hungry , but didn &apos;t get food in@@ definitely . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the house library as food out of the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a Liber@@ al Party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read articles from op@@ positions like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith to the official media reports about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not ref@@ rain with her . &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family often because they thought I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; there again . &quot;
&quot; their Lord fear@@ ing that they would lose the education they had enabled her to lose , she explains . &quot;
&quot; but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that almost never talked about is mo@@ b@@ bing and the sham@@ ans who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to come home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships originate , I particularly felt that I was not one group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
society endor@@ ses Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share advertisements for cleaning staff and orph@@ ans in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s administrators is P@@ epa Cos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little girl for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .

please log in .
starting from Monday if possible .
the ad got five &quot; likes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a fine @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; a girl from the heart@@ land that wants to work &quot; &quot; was written . &quot;
then the check @-@ in of the display turned again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I check if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was completed .

bill is writing Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
Pix@@ ab@@ ay &apos;s image changes from global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; regul@@ ating regulation on use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law a place would be set up , which is commissioned to give citizens a permit to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the site with their correct names and identity numbers in order to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if this fails to do so , it could take a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ es of money . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six parag@@ rap@@ hs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs and used across the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video messages and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how the Egyptian authorities are able to impose their registration on how the Egyptian authorities are not able to register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation at the level of Social Media . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and a password to get through the fire@@ wall connecting Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to make a fire@@ wall around Facebook on a national level . because of those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network . &quot;
but it has not been known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist from the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ) , &quot; commented Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I am deeply involved in technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just like they have for@@ ci@@ bly control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter people who seek approval or not . and that is a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to supply them to a trial . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt all is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislature and the constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military thought in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and should be ensured that no diver@@ ging nar@@ ration is present on the scene , &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those intended to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq the animal conserv@@ ation@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq wish to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards w@@ anders through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . &quot;
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza pic@@ ks up in the video , the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem , and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem will also depend on a large predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard actually in the free game is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza passion@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
&quot; since 2013 , it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to ensuring protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for the Nor@@ theast of Japan , documented the progress achieved over the last six years in order to restore the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima occurred . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a major pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had let whole coastal towns disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture Fu@@ kus@@ hima still experienced a nuclear accident , alone because alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; from a local perspective , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o report shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
&quot; apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( &quot; Sign@@ aling &quot; , &quot; sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to achieve the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 per cent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hima makes its final light at 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ unter@@ fei@@ ts ( &quot; &quot; Sun , &quot; &quot; kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) still endeav@@ our to reloc@@ ate into final replac@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; after the triple disaster , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , still 36@@ 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation in@@ filtr@@ ated after the disaster in mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led in final homes . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure here is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by accident , opened its doors by December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial re@@ building in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land , have suffered enorm@@ ously in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recovered 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of arable land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hima are located in the &quot; nuclear wave zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains far away . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level , as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to obtain an overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and how her feeling changed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
&quot; the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
how it is about those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its issue for the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to witness not only the tremendous earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 stand , 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated ones who are still living in temporary shel@@ ters are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people come across from other countries that speak another language , the differences appear to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recognizes that one more links than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat subjects that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment , in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders . &quot;
&quot; Veron@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ita explains how the love of music has led her aff@@ ection to the Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa considers the time she worked with people from all over the world , and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has gathered in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

Brazilian activ@@ ist in an artificial coma after being crushed by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 came into the intensive care unit this week : last Friday a police officer had attacked him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a strike against the head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a march against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on this Saturday and now transferred him into an artificial coma .
its condition is deemed to be critical .
&quot; the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures , the police officer &apos;s face can also be seen , which attacked with a strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian State of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from the active service until the end of the investigation . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer how he beats in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer sm@@ ug@@ gled by a demonstr@@ ator and would land on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and split several param@@ ours shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users now have 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;

police cor@@ ps
&quot; it was not the only state in Brazil , in which last Friday there was brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; police officers deployed at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber floors and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and peace party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to give up violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have covered road protests by directing the focus to another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a wind@@ screen . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo deliberately reported on a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their cover pages illustr@@ atively .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a set alight . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window of window than the protests of thousands of thousands of people serving the defence of a special thing .
this must also be recognised if you are strictly against any kind of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ serves a absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on a confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Vill@@ ages of For@@ gotten Vill@@ ages in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso law , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba opened doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the popular Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill , not@@ withstanding the fact that there is no significant sugar harvesting on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar cane factories .
&quot; the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the skel@@ eton of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
other res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who is standing up every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , does not ro@@ b his sleep in the sugar cane industry . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period , because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene reminds himself exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news . &quot;
why was the cub@@ an sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the church saw even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated , and scar@@ cely competitive it became unbe@@ arable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production goal was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
&quot; they left only the factories , which could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) . &quot;
the solution for unemployment ?
&quot; the motives , which led to such measures , were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantation and the sugar crisis on the global market . &quot;
&quot; however , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s will remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the Report &quot; Agricultural Growth &quot; by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization . &quot;
&quot; if the current production reached the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate circa 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro , during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training . &quot;
the same happened at the Su@@ gar @-@ cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the close of the factory , is the word he repeated most , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; these were officially included documents which would be distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
from then on the responsibility was over and the letters were becoming more and more frequent .
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories , &quot; he insur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was opposed to his will at the de@@ commissioning of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work set was extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services that were generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during M@@ amm@@ ut &apos;s speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president looked into the eyes of the people who were present when he guaranteed that for the regions whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding since 2004 .

&quot; after two years the popular church Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to bul@@ ge it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ing the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other companies . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to pick up other factories . &quot;
they became spare parts .
&quot; without the prospects for the future , many young people even abandoned the region . &quot;
&quot; a food factory was created in the area , whose production is not even used for the care of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working . &quot;
forty @-@ forty harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month to spend the years reti@@ ring in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a contribut@@ or , but he does not forgive the lies you told him . &quot;
they have been tor@@ menting it for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene is going to reti@@ re at age 65 , not because he lacks power , but because he is em@@ bit@@ tered . &quot;

&quot; since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop managers have brought mobile studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
the original workshops were conducted by educ@@ ators David Hod@@ ges who lives in Montreal and worked together in Northern Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ stars .
&quot; the workshop thus increases that young participants in talks like &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in western Canada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were mostly not explained .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences caused by globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs have been published in indigenous languages , although the young people don &apos;t always know the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young@@ sters involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ star Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English , translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in myself
but I try to keep my days on Earth
this is the day you will take our scre@@ am .
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and also advance our youth
&quot; so they can do so , where@@ of they have appointed the Creator . &quot;
&quot; in the comment section , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ent of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and adds the verse to Sil@@ ben@@ schrift ( which is also published on his blog and re @-@ published here with permission ) : &quot;
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; plastic dishes ( &quot; &quot; lost &quot; &quot; ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

in Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , will be exhibited close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings &apos; , &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tics Models of the Cour@@ ts &quot; ) , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see themselves in these plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a large number of these small companies that produce those sculp@@ tural dishes , which the German filmm@@ aker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented more than 20 years ago in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they don &apos;t even see them anymore . however , a new trend turns them into show@@ y mobile phone accessories and other gad@@ gets nowadays . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new vinyl w@@ rist@@ bands decorated with plastic bags , as shown at the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tokyo department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collec@@ ti@@ bles , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fri@@ dges mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food trends is becoming increasingly complex .
&quot; in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile @-@ stand . &quot;
&quot; for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) , we found a good use as a mobile @-@ stand . &quot;
also this part was made for the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple containing your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design . &quot;
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
&quot; some mobile and mobile designers allow you to produce your own work of art . in this case ik@@ ura or salmon have been used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice . &quot;
some users had their doubts on Twitter :
&quot; there is someone who would say , &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with laugh@@ ing che@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic bags can also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasantly . &quot;
our latest phone stand has the form of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ belts made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; you can view more sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug tra@@ ff@@ ick@@ ers , &quot;

&quot; in reports in- and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed workers regularly appear in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looking at the mour@@ ners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learning with the drug trade &quot; ) , which tells these victims a voice and nar@@ rates stories of people involved in the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug traders and therefore whole communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the Pain of the Vic@@ tims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear changed life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on only one day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta said : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not pay it off because they demand a certificate of death . &quot;
where should we get here ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the Federal State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what shape it occurs : &quot;
I have known sickness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; I am coming to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from experts of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug tra@@ der ) , if he &apos;s big . and it &apos;s also not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me this is as if they mo@@ ck those that have lost someone , and those who are afraid that something happens to them . &quot;
&quot; I see our weakness , if stories become mere figures in a statistic . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of men is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town can be justified &quot; that they were &quot; gil@@ ded . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to convince themselves that they remain spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , if they are not touched and quiet . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family was spo@@ ilt for month money from their business , until they destroyed not only the business , but also tore their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything that you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain on it never fails , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes again high if you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , telephone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the far@@ ther we are apart from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report in the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because they don &apos;t know when they are kidn@@ apped or killed . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days I wondered whether crying would dis@@ solve my deeply rooted feelings , but the response is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he says that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , warm tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells about the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
&quot; however , they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years earlier , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; born in Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence through organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Prosec@@ ution had 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to average 8.5 mur@@ ders per day . &quot;
&quot; these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico , which penet@@ rates into the soul of the country . &quot;
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 created the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to illustrate the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades . &quot;
if one picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strö@@ ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which he links contain images on which violence is depicted .
&quot; the check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or , or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; but what about the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to be@@ fall trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
this false link@@ age of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not den@@ ies the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank car tra@@ vers@@ ed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated it . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes , which were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the tank car fell victim to the victim . &quot;
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses envel@@ op@@ ed , including a movie nearby which was full of people who watched the World Cup . &quot;
houses ro@@ uted and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burnt to ignorance .
&quot; an image with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident will form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
there are rows of char@@ red bodies that are lined up on the floor while individuals are watching them .
but here history does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was raised several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 comb@@ at@@ ants from B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ p@@ ses were in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count the cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said one of the inhabitants of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were crushed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the following time could be portra@@ yed figur@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo emerged again when it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the potential scale of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
you are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the picture from DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ de@@ preci@@ ation ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the image was brought forward as a proof for mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments , such as this example , fal@@ sely link the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments . &quot;
the picture of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a bl@@ itz , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee blows , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this image comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , which in 2012 claimed , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein reported that monks and politicians had taken part in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from DR Congo to picture this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , who called AF@@ P as their source , had mistakenly attribute Th@@ ein to this statement , but had not associated with the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo . &quot;
the global reach of false information
traces of these false dec@@ eption range back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using an &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross boundaries . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ eye was found in 18,@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixture of private pages , platforms of social media and common as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have for@@ warded false reports and some have tried to expose the for@@ geri@@ es .
&quot; we have narrow@@ ed examples of mis@@ use usage and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of which page they were published . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than by language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also linked ) , several examples may be used for mis@@ use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be fully felt ( on the card in orange ) :

&quot; this correction , which is exclusively published in English , also includes references to counter@@ f@@ eit images of sc@@ ents that H@@ ate Speech can operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to explain that Muslims are killing Budd@@ hi@@ sts and elsewhere ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , addressed to the members of the Orthodox Church , clearly states that the picture of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims to kill the Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein occurred in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and the picture is still included in this publication .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article by 2014 about students who have been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news site An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar d@@ ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;

&quot; the picture was t@@ wit@@ ched as a receipt for the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre ( and saved more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the objective was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that was allegedly written by an &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussions forums like this in Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to counter@@ fei@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; from the message contained in the picture from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos stood dis@@ soci@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; in other accounts , generators and sites in the following countries ( on the paper@@ board in grey ) , Tin@@ eye also points , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and sometimes have image file names associated with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and frames
there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) that carry through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussion about silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians through Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how pictures can be used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are dozens of people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggest this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and har@@ den the real horror of what has actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the distribution of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that ref@@ using images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that for@@ ci@@ ble images des@@ ensi@@ tise readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study which investigated how violent media seem to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about for@@ ci@@ ble depic@@ tions in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be detached from the context or completely ab@@ usive way . &quot;
&quot; however , each investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
Andy S@@ imm@@ ons photo is used according to CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 .
&quot; a blog called un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
&quot; these words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
&quot; some of these conf@@ using words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others , deeply rooted in a special culture ( e.g. Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) . &quot;
but all resist@@ ently resist any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog , for example , you can find words from the V@@ ap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Imag@@ ine your parents in recognition of how you have tried to keep you in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ al@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after having heated up in the sun in cold days .
in Birds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; conf@@ lic@@ able &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; which are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

Sri Lanka is moving with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ fill disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally uses end of May , rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after a statement from the Sri L@@ ank@@ an disaster area of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly 100 people were missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud wave winds . &quot;
&quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and about 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe locations . &quot;
&quot; rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene levels of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :

the Air Force provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are being completed for the transport of emergency shipments for the inhabitants enclosed in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also been able to help .
fac@@ ebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .

&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ ophone Center informs . &quot;
&quot; last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which enabled users to call a vehicle for retri@@ eving help and donations . they were then transferred to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free . &quot;
&quot; they also led a &quot; SO@@ S &quot; button , which resulted in more than 1000 requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ds and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the efforts made by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully util@@ ised , bring residents in need of security and help aid measures . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka being the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;
Muslims that cannot be seen
the Women &apos;s March 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust in her my four years old daughter , she trust@@ s me with her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
in the one minute we call still slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; in the next election , we are making rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , others are gu@@ essing slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; these things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; that has built up in their conception . &quot;
they mus@@ li@@ fy me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look the same .
we practise our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit into , are ab@@ used . &quot;
to be counter@@ mus@@ li@@ zed
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures do you have in mind when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
&quot; another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ istic images of Muslims , which have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries . &quot;
this entic@@ ing image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ assembled the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures rise further today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to betra@@ y them . &quot;
&quot; I have been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years , and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous sc@@ ars dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative is over@@ shad@@ owed by the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries during the last three decades , while the US did not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ rowing fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying out their head@@ scarf in public buildings , and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group ex@@ erts his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
&quot; it be@@ holds that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , who had been brought here with slave ships . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of Qu@@ eer @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and flaw@@ lessly , that Sik@@ h @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Catholic attacks and chic@@ an@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
among the 1,7 billion include :
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives who help us to understand the world .
and my industry failure failed to capture the sc@@ ars of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed to see where seven million Muslims represent the highest degree &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; religious groups in America . &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ fought Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue , and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrap@@ ers of New York . sky@@ scrap@@ ers were made possible by the Bangladesh American St@@ ati@@ ker , named Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan had re@@ invented the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were too many Muslims and Americans . &quot;
&quot; but am I now a sore , Muslim and American ? &quot;
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of catching up my mus@@ li@@ m recipes or my handy pocket @-@ grain that all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; &quot; out of respect for pe@@ pp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I hear , we don &apos;t wear all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be a &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be picked up for extra security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of emin@@ ent Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists seeking to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the running volume by a well @-@ ta@@ sted Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia lies in more than just a stranger who breaks the head@@ scarf to a woman . &quot;
&quot; or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the US , see below . &quot;
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our belonging .
&quot; it attacks our identity , which is so expan@@ sive , so versatile and complex that it can &apos;t fit into a drawer . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim was born only then in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they return to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my neighbour , my rock in the surf see that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a , if it could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I saw her in my arms , and her the Arabic verses to protect the Koran , which are called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the author &apos;s grandmother , when she wins an I@@ k@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , pos@@ ing with her sisters sometime in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
belonging to me is the image of my grandmother on my part with her sisters ; as she had decades ago a competition of the art of arran@@ ging flowers in Kar@@ achi .
&quot; it is the image of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted by Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; to be Mus@@ lim@@ a means speaking the prayers that she told me to speak , if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; to be Mus@@ lim@@ a is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a nation that has been colon@@ ized through a &quot; empire &quot; for centuries , which a company established with the name of Ven@@ erable British colon@@ ists , it has a profound meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging to me means growing up and hearing that men do not we@@ ep , but at the same time to see that my beloved grandfather is crying . &quot;
&quot; while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ a , N@@ ana J@@ aan we@@ pt for his family in India , which he could not close to his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at risk . &quot;
&quot; to be Mus@@ lim@@ a means knowing that over the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; &quot; all the way to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected by a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , ash@@ mir@@ ish sub@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time when he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to belong to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ mind@@ ful history .
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over every continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , went into Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Muslim is to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy escap@@ es the US and bears a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel as people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani woman , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , is the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of the 1,7 billion holds more possibilities than a cube of magic , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble two &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals on this duality establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is made up of Muslim registri@@ es that began with President Bush and wi@@ dened under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of immigration officers who take a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that ex@@ cludes its borders towards people from just the countries that are being bombar@@ ded .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list , &quot; which mostly takes Arabs and Muslims into sight . &quot;
it is the wars that we lead and the bombs we reject in Muslim countries .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University showed a scientifically wrong image and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with regard to evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the lowest score .
the conversations we have to lead
we are too deep to enth@@ r@@ act the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we are going back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the bad and dangerous expression , which we ste@@ ad@@ fast@@ ly in our news editors . &quot;
&quot; at least , there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast Sea Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the American video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IST@@ AN@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global timing in which we are .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ or@@ ists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , they had not yet existed ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I have not been aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who have made me a Muslim today . &quot;
things I left here like a bread roll in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity makes , a story may lie where someone is made to a &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the Berkeley Bridge Con@@ vers@@ ations take place at the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred acade@@ mics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools or read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be led and people affected by creating the &quot; other &quot; in public perception , was even more academic of Stan@@ ford four decades ago . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , deliberately and un@@ consciously strengthening the &quot; other . &quot; as my girlfriend and I do in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake comes out , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for story@@ telling aims to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to this . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the feasi@@ bility of the project :
mass extinction of the world &apos;s languages can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; while often associated with it , &quot; &quot; these events &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; offer these events &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , feel , soci@@ alize . &quot;
&quot; in this format , story@@ t@@ ellers imagine their story in their own language and translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not professional story@@ t@@ ellers , their dedication and representation will lead to re@@ adership . &quot;
they call laughter and emotion as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ men@@ ou preser@@ ves the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara tells the f@@ able of the h@@ are and the b@@ abo@@ on in the Sh@@ ona language from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara asks : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to extend this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ t@@ ellers . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the US re @-@ fixing the state debt
&quot; on 3 April 2017 , several religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place on April 3 , 2017 in the capital city of the capital city , and went to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;

&quot; the people Puerto Rico asks that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt are held accoun@@ table for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and an executive committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed remun@@ eration that acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be deter@@ red with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the con@@ fession of an integrated sovereign territory - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens , measures imposed on the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed by the people . &quot;
the demonstration wore the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web@@ entwick@@ ler Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on the digital culture that is held in Berlin , dedicated itself to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book S@@ prints , published books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is freely available here , contains a number of papers dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it is said : &quot;
this book aims to discuss how Mov@@ ements for Free Knowledge can be built and what is the real cost associated with .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to find out about the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was cancelled out of the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , immediately . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for its participation in a free culture , many of us have started thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of time @-@ wise extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in detention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police b@@ ass@@ el on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court took part in his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that they were contacted by people on November 12 , 2015 , who themselves presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against their husband . &quot;
&quot; however , its place of residence and condition remains unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a key role in extending the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototypes was more forward @-@ looking than the work that he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations , and here the Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bass@@ el couldn &apos;t know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything on this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria , but the world . &quot;
&quot; this journey into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent all my life in dre@@ aming of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in jail .
&quot; I have learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he taught me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a Pro@@ sab@@ uch that she wrote to her husband in 2012 @-@ 2015 when he was in jail . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a spent a year on the book together .
&quot; she sm@@ ug@@ gled the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English . &quot;
the book is freely available .

here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
&quot; it happens every time you visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink into the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the senses in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the prison of prison
&quot; and I enter into every detail of your voice and words , &quot;
&quot; with passion with me , &quot;
when your eyes bid farewell
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my sol@@ itude , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and about your absence and to cry and smile .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; one year passed , my soul &quot;
during the course of the week
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ sels history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; until 2016 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans died in detention . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; today , we repeat our call in the hope that we have to do for the last time . &quot;
Mozambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted director after release again at previous post
&quot; after half of his sentence , a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus at which the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 due to a good lead and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office of the Republic who rejected the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ b@@ aza to reg@@ ain his old posts , since the company did not conduct disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not call the action good . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Safety ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in view of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company would also have to initiate a disciplinary procedure against the contradic@@ ting ones .
&quot; the company apparently was silent , however , and did not initiate appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had been left . &quot;
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches and he could advise and polish his image .
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped inf@@ lict damage . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will love to be paid for his silence . &quot;
reluc@@ tant !
&quot; bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ an and student of political science in Brazil says , the director has no moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state because he s@@ wore it , I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza lacks the return of morality and serving the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served himself in the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as being an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself is tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president forever as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , cutting @-@ edge and - by the way - proph@@ etic speeches . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of selling also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not the case . he does not change tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also notable : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and was free . &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
&quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting b@@ asses . &quot;
photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely dissi@@ p@@ ative con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims that represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of useful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with racism today , but the word in itself does not automatically call to hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about his use , were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( altern@@ ator ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ B@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; but he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way , if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain , making a p@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; &quot; cure &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook has to be more analy@@ tic before releasing all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on a fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words side by side .
&quot; for example , &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ ect@@ ins &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; ( altern@@ ating balls ) . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech have received a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to cur@@ tail their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all who spread hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts , when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was aware of this new Facebook policy , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to delete posts and parts of content for 24 hours because the mail &quot; did not meet the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech away from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his views on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will bring even more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they started this without a local context or technical support and banned words such as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not attempt to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they would have more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
Chrom@@ ebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate speech but were still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook removes the post that contains the word Kal@@ ar .
screen@@ shot using permission .
&quot; post : &quot; &quot; if you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot using permission .
&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally involve violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
Facebook was critic@@ ised for its failure to bring up the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
&quot; but instead of just cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better in context than focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is finished with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 . &quot;
the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament voted unanim@@ ously a law to prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the marriage @-@ capable age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this change of the marriage network , some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities adher@@ ed to practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , because the age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened not@@ withstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; every person under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the UN statistics for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago amounted to 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married to 19 from 1997 to 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements that stri@@ ved to abol@@ ish laws to inf@@ use , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . no doubt they helped to bring about this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to say to the cri@@ tiques of the chil@@ dr@@ ens , they should , to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this type of religious opposition ensured tension in this un@@ complicated situation , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against child@@ birth - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , who could be discussed so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook which re@@ posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
&quot; Mr Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the birth of the child was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives , with 35 votes for it , and no one against them . &quot;
&quot; having previously been decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who dressed up a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which disgu@@ ises the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now and it is worth almost any price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : &quot;
the marriage network has been decided .

&quot; the draft on the change of the marriage network was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;

&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed and he seems to be able to fulfil his ple@@ dge . &quot;
&quot; during the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris , Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj had wanted to act against the law , most social media users would like to approach the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , instead of talking so generally , instead of talking so broad@@ ly , instead of talking about the problem , if we , instead of talking about the problem , we would say that the state , our daughters from it , would protect you that they may be mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are opposed to them , &quot; would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child@@ birth is legal or still the norm in different gra@@ d@@ ations , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them . &quot;

&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform cleared all Turkish Wikipedia @-@ pages on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer computer @-@ links ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; in spite of the legal ban , the content is available . &quot;
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after listening to the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the contents in a de@@ centralized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia sites , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ or@@ g. &quot;
IP@@ FS was also admitted that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation and it is only Screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror @-@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors if Wikipedia is banned in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ny reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices as well as collabor@@ ators at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
you access a different URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; in essence , the server re@@ direc@@ ts the query to the correct Wikipedia Site , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself then if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for conservation .

photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him , they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poor@@ ly positioned motifs and full @-@ washed colors . &quot;
this motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to straigh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nepal stri@@ ves to bring Nepal to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese animals . &quot;
&quot; he described on Facebook , how this first @-@ class situation helps in his work : &quot;
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
&quot; when suddenly Navar@@ aj was calling me ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) , he had received a call from my father that was a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river . &quot;
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I started off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to take pictures ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar aims to co @-@ operate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature , and would like to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he should know it , for he was standing before face to face to Tig@@ ers : &quot;
a tiger cannot be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ ggy appeared . he sat down right away , we look at and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to shoot in the Bar@@ dia National Park shots of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist arri@@ vals .
see some of these pictures below .

&quot; years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time . &quot;

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ mp@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women are avoided with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of the social pressure and the fear of the consequences they should respect the norm , maintain this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a fake court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also does not call their names , is also widespread among men . however , they have far fewer re@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if at all which , they should not meet this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ er in P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel , and house@@ wives , became a unique club and thus quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign that is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and guides these clubs . &quot;
she reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion session was women who did not call her hus@@ bands by name .
she decided on this subject because she wanted to talk about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women could identify easily .
&quot; to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands out loud , is a custom that they all enti@@ t@@ antly maintain and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not keep this , is considered as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without mor@@ als . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round .
&quot; at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who has never been named her husband by name , wanted to try at home at home as it is going on . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , aff@@ ection@@ ate and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; If we can &apos;t say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; said Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of an age @-@ old tradition , in which married women can never speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise she was just ahead of herself ; another decided to let the whole host of fru@@ stration come out against him and his family by cur@@ sing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in the adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an age @-@ old custom , the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini has received a lot of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another member of the club decided to do it for dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got scar@@ ed and said it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports on how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zinc @-@ red dot on the forehead that shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do women just have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the interest @-@ red dot if he did it as well .
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women have not ceased entirely , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip to each discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the past few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their life ; they d@@ anced and sang and spoke about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things such as our identi@@ ties tied to our hus@@ bands .
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ oon short , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , mor@@ als connected with the sar@@ is and much more , the Roh@@ ini sm@@ ug@@ gled their own pair of Cur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) in a discussion round so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it . &quot;
&quot; the question , whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed somewhat , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into the roll : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tested it a few times but then stopped telling the name of their husband .
&quot; some , including me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like sli@@ pping around more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult navig@@ ating river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells people about what we &apos;re talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

bald men are drag@@ ged and killed in Mozambique
Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia &apos;s police warned the population that bald men could be the target of attacks in Mozambique .
&quot; photo : An@@ ders Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of ab@@ duction of ordinary people for the organ trade , presum@@ ably for super@@ sti@@ tion purposes , prov@@ okes the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and some of the organs were removed .
&quot; two men were arrested and subsequently , they were admitted that the bodies of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used . &quot;
&quot; according to the local super@@ sti@@ tions , that the head of a man @-@ headed man could contain gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia received the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the aim of assass@@ ination for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the UN 2016 in the South African country to carry out a mission to investigate this practice .
&quot; persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are target of ritual attacks , warned the Muslim police after the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ burg in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police have already followed the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ avia , Province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims existed in mind , the riches of wealth . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men have been killed with hair loss problems in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Mozambique faces : &quot;
&quot; I would like to ask E@@ IN MO@@ SA@@ BI@@ K , THE S@@ ICH , a country in which people would have shame to pay sex against good grades , or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald men are hun@@ ted for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not escape the opportunity for imp@@ ec@@ cable humor . &quot;
&quot; Mr Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ted that both the chief of the Mor@@ aro@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange , as well as the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both of them are : &quot;

a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that was probably just recently made .
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , in the international community , attracted attention in the international community after having announced his lawyer at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end of June . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State of State ) , having participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China has called Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man told that he did not consider it as &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or allow him treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out of the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Mr. R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Li@@ u a treatment abroad . &quot;
Norway - Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us Frei@@ sen .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell into shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government stated that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume salmon trips to China , as the exports were largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
the European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us , as stated in an explanation on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to lift all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits that they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States
&quot; ambassador Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad told the Americans that he would have the possibility to treat abroad , in so far as he helped him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person for U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy needs to release the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the US Embassy promp@@ ts a fur@@ ious answer from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible statements about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley informed that China should offer the following to the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot;
&quot; U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing the news agency Reuters , that China had big concerns about whether the land@@ owner could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u an appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to care for his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not permitted to talk with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um says :
&quot; Canada invites China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and release them for exercising these rights . &quot;
France : France
France &apos;s foreign ministry demanded that China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons on 29 June :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments he needs , regardless of where , . furthermore , his wife and family are to have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information whether France will ultimately accept it . &quot;
Taiwan and Taiwan
&quot; the Council of land@@ ings in Taiwan called on China to release Li@@ u on June 27 , to show a greater tolerance towards those who advoc@@ ate peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called on China to allow the ill @-@ intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on June 28 around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for which he had been severely punished , had led to a more harmon@@ ic , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally troubled and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed Charter 08 that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , Singapore should be regarded as a city . &quot;
this remark triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister noticed that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one asked whether New York was a democracy ...
this is where most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian regime of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Shan@@ mu@@ iden were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal states &apos; in the face of that , he appeared inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ itarian rulers appear again , who pret@@ end to be democr@@ ats , leave the distor@@ ted logic because it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam gave answers to his American guests with regard to our press , our judicial , our political system , really no answers . &quot;
he disgu@@ sted such questions with non @-@ responses of rational nature .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Shan@@ u@@ gam to clarify his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country is our city belongs ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Shan@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point , provided he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out on the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shan@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam as Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ) .
&quot; when he said to Singapore , &quot; &quot; No country , &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ iden , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
&quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice has said of Singapore , ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it , associates and is aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ integr@@ ates the weak points of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos; arguments :
has Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam &quot; made a mistake &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian advoc@@ ate ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country do the sovereign rights of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally country and city .
&quot; since it plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ ise are of serious significance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do they not defend their city ? &quot;
who must pay back our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; journey of a Dec@@ ade tends to be Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city : &quot;
I didn &apos;t say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many Singap@@ ur@@ ans ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; the defence of the country especially &quot; &quot; etc . , but that is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Can@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect about your home or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series that rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world will be revealed and another fac@@ et shall be shown .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is most put to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I will answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I have been living in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in its inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication often follows the standard response : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans are perhaps cooking in@@ war@@ dly with anger when they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little difference between Americans and Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
American on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex mar@@ riages are legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
apparently we say very often &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends I admire very much . &quot;
it wouldn &apos;t mind me if you would switch me to Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; first , to be called &quot; nice , &quot; basically means to be fun - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders of &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has an own Canadian dup@@ lic@@ ator ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no edges and edges , nothing that you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means being in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
&quot; that can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go so far , to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; might just be cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with their neighbours .
&quot; we miss the warm , open kindness which I have meanwhile joined with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; our Prime Minister made Canada ou@@ tri@@ ght sexy . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ ing Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
&quot; a popular pop band released in Thailand has published a music video that par@@ o@@ dic@@ ates the jun@@ ta , which in 2014 seized the power and in spite of its promise to restore the civil government , continues the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band &quot; Colour describes a young man , who tells the rules his girlfriend wants . &quot;
&quot; although not explicit politically , the music video refers indirectly to the ongoing military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a great success .
&quot; in the first three days alone , the video was shared on Facebook 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 re@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
take a look at these videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which grants the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute discretion on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your mind@@ set , &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; &quot; change of settings &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit in the army was also established , the online content supervis@@ es and persons accused of having lost the monarchy , prosec@@ uting . &quot;
Thailand sets a strict law against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ ority &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Product ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the martial law was declared in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security professionals warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black v@@ amp@@ er before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band that im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society is slowly reco@@ vers in East @-@ West Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has been over 20 years since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ ch@@ astic war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ ean are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ sch@@ asia , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the Soviet area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the biggest part of Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10,000 people here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely climbed over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60 &apos;s , which are called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ uch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why do you talk ? &quot;
&quot; ( users View@@ ing this Forum : 1 ) 1,@@ 50@@ 6 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
&quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot;
&quot; there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded mag@@ nific@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ry@@ osh@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still house one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they withdraw immediately . &quot;
&quot; our mother was forbidden to photograph us , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence farming ( farming of agricultural products for personal use ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable growing . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration supplies candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , Chi@@ ap@@ as State , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
&quot; this article by A@@ my Br@@ acken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula and is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink frame and gold coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear . &quot;
&quot; she is , Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 Dollars per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come to full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying out : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you m@@ um Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; currently it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have slept on cart@@ ons even outside . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse .
&quot; she helps them and brings her to the hospital if they are sick , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they cannot pay , she massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he replies with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston , to find her husband and the three children there . &quot;
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans are often travelling along the way and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before working as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for several months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he replies , smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian belief is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have picked up migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are being sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them to get an appropriate price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking area outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have seen what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States following a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown , single trav@@ eller , offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
&quot; in the courses , the travelers consult quietly their phones . &quot;
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests ; a large part of Somalia .
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grandmother she bl@@ ends in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ stain@@ s she has made her a female , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly while she introduces her to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; she repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users , &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the West of China , are forced to install an spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10th , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi City were receiving a mobile phone notification in which they reported the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app is intended to prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a security service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ackers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in the region .
&quot; while reports about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often dim for those who live in remote , oppressed ethnic regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , authorities often associate extreme cens@@ or@@ ings and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet searches . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet for Twitter based media outlet &quot; Images from In China &quot; ( &quot; Gre@@ etings in China &quot; ) , which cens@@ ored the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point at which polic@@ emen checked the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ano ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use appliances intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the use technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from &quot; &quot; China &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Comp@@ any@@ ard &quot; &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which indicates that the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system , thus receiving un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after the J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang installation , computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the city council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and affiliated institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office while operating their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of Ur@@ um@@ qi &apos;s regional capital to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; this action , however , viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is , three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or death ; Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and find that you are alone in a place where everything has disappeared . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissi@@ p@@ ated and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable , both from inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes all honor to her name .
&quot; one that has kno@@ cked down into a list of feelings and expressions , which do not allow metaph@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; but when reality comes back and you look behind the scenes - beyond acting , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters transformed into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth moves on the axis of the evil . it becomes clear that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone by stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn away from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like dar@@ nel .
&quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all quarters preferred , but my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , it was quiet , mot@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; I interrupted the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot;
I heard my voice re@@ bu@@ ked by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , real friends joined me ; we joined us to a glorious picture that filled my expectations with full satisfaction . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you release the ghost from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice back , after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of security service out of the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an starts speaking , &quot; &quot; Let me also hear how you cry &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you &apos;re only brave enough to scre@@ am when we &apos;re not nearby . &quot;
his hate @-@ filled eyes were directed toward me .
and you really mo@@ urn what to look into the eyes and not on the ground !
what I then did has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity , perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure about my thing when I replied , &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father equal with it . &quot;
&quot; his father , just like that . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed proposition is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture , which I was suspended for months . &quot;
I crossed the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
&quot; then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I remember all the details before I enter the room .
&quot; unlike anything else , they have now assigned to me a larger cell . &quot;
&quot; I have to share them with only one single prisoner , and I must immediately put myself without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell and I got back to an old tried and tested communication method : hitting the wall with the fist . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; self @-@ help &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me in the end .
&quot; apparently there was none of the surrounding cells a resp@@ ectable middle @-@ aged man , who looks like me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , there are no apparent fac@@ tions in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all numbers only . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like my voice ? &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will be inter@@ rog@@ ated immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I stay . &quot;
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to drive out all these crow@@ s that cling to the fruits in my head &apos;s garden .
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them cry &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the cri@@ es appear every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light presented to us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to 13 Sur@@ a the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be li@@ stens .
&quot; thus , the secret was revealed : to protect the state security from us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Algeri@@ an dial@@ ect - and they betra@@ yed their sec@@ t@@ arian black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow viewpoint of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a land here ; it is a curse they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the audi@@ torium and meet in Abu I@@ mad , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes before me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will eventually come to an end . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I got used to it not to respond .
I can really no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and blows have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
on punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the clo@@ ac@@ ons .
your exec@@ ution@@ er fast@@ ens to your cry .
&quot; give him pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him , and you cannot hold your cri@@ es back . &quot;
my scre@@ ams were not yet enough for him so they exchanged the tube through a cable .
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector , or whether this belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us the , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no delight at all , which is why he picked up next to an electri@@ cally charged staff . &quot;
&quot; electricity f@@ lowed all my body , enough to supply my entire district . &quot;
my half @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; a few hours passed , which came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens , and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ass@@ fu@@ cian . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young@@ ster : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must worry terri@@ bly . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and leave you , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he goes to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stain@@ ed with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has been part of them since 1967 ; the year when Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ted ( about : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their old @-@ proven views on gender roles , sexu@@ ality , and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the heart of the whole Arab world . all these topics are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man relev@@ ancy but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking , and he can feel with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he won a special dis@@ like against US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; stresses H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a human being , &quot; as the Nes@@ café dissolved in water . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . at this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a sen@@ sing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the pieces speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ ders of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you have a look into neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to avoid basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan said a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ hip ham@@ ed Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert evening . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the members and former spokes@@ persons of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said that the concert was &quot; straight &quot; cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free speech in the Arab world is a dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the proven legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights , &quot; who continue to use intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement should probably not be simply a rhet@@ or@@ ical rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alizing reality in Jordan that clearly appears in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b returned to traditional sex men , by completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently stom@@ ped unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women , who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , the number of &quot; honor@@ ary kill@@ ings &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honor@@ ary kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still more difficult to support the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence , in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on comb@@ ating crime in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence are often held in prison for an in@@ definite period of time , and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucracy as well as the guarantee provided by the family that nothing will happen . &quot;
&quot; also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known to not shy away from topics , which are long as tab@@ oos in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but adm@@ its that he is not able to separate his music , which is full of explicit reference to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics was denied to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the kernel can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which you can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noted that hardly anyone talks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were cens@@ ored in 2014 until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to later point out that his comments were torn , twi@@ sted and cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not ent@@ ail Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ i , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why cannot Jordan be this ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , Jord@@ anian Intelligence recorded several former government dep@@ u@@ ties and members of the teacher &apos;s association with the reason they had critical comments in social media critical to the problems rooted deeply in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs concert is report@@ edly only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant gr@@ asp@@ ing and taking . Jordan has prevented M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s how it sees H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , thank@@ ful and inner changes . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is approaching a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , sc@@ attering and artificial democr@@ acies . &quot;
&quot; until the time has come , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to act and therefore resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big and extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one suppos@@ es that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fe@@ asts , the drums and dancing come from a period of time , in the armies of the West of Japan to the northeast , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the disciples , to their knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
it is hard to imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I have been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two v@@ ans are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and yet a breathtaking way to spend its summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ tall car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

external appearance and body care have rarely been as important as in this story because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
&quot; Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoking and illegal drug trafficking are common . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of the region did not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , experiences rising demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go to the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these intri@@ cate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
experts play against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos about current competitions can be found on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their arms against hair@@ dressing tools and receive training in hair@@ dres@@ sers , which enables them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district we are very proud because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : declaration of love to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

the following article is the edited version of &quot; Love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important , people who feel pushed out , aff@@ ection aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; this is precisely the question of the young Colom@@ bian milit@@ ants Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a donated by the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired her to campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la recon@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write err@@ illa fighters letters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa war F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the sign@@ atory of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; before the Colom@@ bian people there is still a long way , until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ac@@ ists , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to war rhet@@ oric and were carrying their arms around the clock , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; in turn , Colom@@ bian society , who has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now record them in their ranks and support them in building up a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans would join together and help in the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illas to welcome them back in society . &quot;
the goal of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter - who are to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for reconciliation emerged at the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he explained that we write to the people we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s day thousands of love letters , but those who need them much more need@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people , who needed the most urgent appeal this year . &quot;
&quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia including Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
&apos;@@ I never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN stock@@ pil@@ es in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ art Foundation traveled to the camp to convey the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC were up as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; explained the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a staff member of the governor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we had passed the letters , a former war@@ rior led me by the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a sort of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illas live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter , who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down because beside him on the bed lay a M@@ GL @-@ gren@@ ade , a le@@ thal weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; I spoke to him anyway and asked , &quot; &quot; Hi , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never before in my life somebody wrote something so nice , so I answer it . &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him completely and sat down beside the gren@@ ades .
&quot; perhaps he was suffering the war too , was sorry to be all the years of loyal companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
&quot; at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were joined to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already a war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC announced the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the state worked towards the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party , we can help shape society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worth overcoming all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never heard a hearing and had no voting rights , and to realize that people I often had seen as a monster and even hated people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - even those who have been killed and have done so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; for example , Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the camp &apos;s commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of Cal@@ i , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i : &quot;
Colombia has been prophes@@ ied that after the dis@@ armament there would be peace .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to take up arms , raise themselves and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now putting peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who uph@@ old life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs over the LGB@@ T@@ Q community over the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community has not only emerged overnight .
&quot; OC media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman of Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what has happened in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports published that addressed the deportation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ az@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspic@@ ious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world , &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned of the sex equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
&quot; out of fear for their lives , they ultimately moved to the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a Trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents passed the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was going to show a few shopping bags from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you are de@@ fle@@ xing ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I know only that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and eventually wo@@ ke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had got everything along and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two st@@ ings in my right lung wing . &quot;
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , my male name is still on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful to him for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time on his office door , I got it to do with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has been respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I received threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
&quot; they asked absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running through the streets on the top of the street ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gros@@ ny , and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex , that all was only bad talk , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for her .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You brought a monster to the world not only your family but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we can &apos;t touch you because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother was too much , and she laid a sn@@ are around her neck . &quot;
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with 95 on it .
&quot; after it had happened for the third time , I realized that there was a little la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights friends reviewed the number signs - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you escape ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without regi@@ stering , without notice , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I plug@@ ged the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I asked my mother to call on W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine it ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; but we don &apos;t talk about the gender equ@@ ation , this is a t@@ abo@@ o subject . &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements are still in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , this spiritual barrier cannot be overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with the camera , I really try to see how the person looks at which she rec@@ alls from her past - that is , to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have remained dor@@ man@@ t ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington last week .
&quot; for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who has imprisoned one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan no man was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave . &quot;
they will most likely concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; so I mean , they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are there still gay men held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine said , there were not many . &quot;
&quot; if , then above all , those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to settle Gaddafi &apos;s court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there , so that they can be presented as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply van@@ ishing , but specifically sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alize themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard has grown .
&quot; since then , there has been nothing new about them . &quot;
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken away . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to so @-@ called &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think that before 2003 I was already known in Gros@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; originally , but finally dump@@ ed us back into the stone age . &quot;
OC Media : what is possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had dy@@ ed eyel@@ ashes , wearing both jeans and short Tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never hurt me even a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we were never off@@ ended .
&quot; in Ch@@ echn@@ ya language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ ma ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
they often say to children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so , did they just keep their eyes closed before you because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they have never har@@ med me , never hun@@ ted and never struck . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began speaking on television about morality . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but above all about the behavior of women . &quot;
nevertheless - you could sense how people in the city started to change .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you at once with suspic@@ ion .
&quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic was steadily worse . &quot;
OC Media : what action do you do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organise te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to c@@ ents for it for a long time .
I discovered these people themselves when I r@@ att@@ led the type of refuge .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you have a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
&quot; so nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ ens , who want to prophes@@ y to you with foam in front of your mouth that there are no gay men . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the cab@@ ard@@ ins have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims going into the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know many think about transi@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling , to be exact , different attitudes towards life . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry , I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot;
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 met the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that in@@ capacity for his family could arise , so Ah@@ mad human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he ign@@ ited himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ ade hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Jama@@ hi@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have imposed this month . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family patri@@ cians who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families , and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which a large part of the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arabian Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ monarchy had taken power and in 1925 attempts to end ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z Region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population receives little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime is systematically denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of tribes , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian lands where provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused in the region , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general manager for co @-@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , announced that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are seeking a job , completed the primary school , completed 55 % a secondary school and 45 % had a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
Do@@ hi@@ him@@ i said that unemployment has become more recently worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of new ethnic Persian and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
&quot; since officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will be deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance by young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living from their home Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their pro@@ s and sur@@ names to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i and so be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the speech of Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to endure , human rights activ@@ ist alert the alert before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alen &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ists * .
&quot; for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men nowadays . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms continue to cause women to face a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and discrimination based on gender is still going through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
&quot; I am convinced , and I suffer double and triple among them . &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , if I come to speak on skin color , on racism , black C@@ is women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used under racial seg@@ reg@@ ation and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless , everyone agrees that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift up their voices &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold nature .
or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and countries earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background more often be referred to the school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women are exposed to higher risk in black spheres and women with a migration background , domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t associate myself as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to take injus@@ tices in her mind , which involve both the gender and the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women again and again .
&quot; so@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is a sham@@ eful and margin@@ alised entity in the historic sense . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which , moreover , by cultural appropri@@ ation absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to expose white women the importance of over@@ lap of skin color and gender . for some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to reward them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still is in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which is so persistent for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ em , the author of the book &quot; Afri@@ cana His@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we ourselves reg@@ ain ourselves ) speaks of how we can defend ourselves in this way , where they are completely safe and can be rever@@ ed by the cultural , mental , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements that make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures because within this paradigm I exist .
&quot; because of my dark skin and on account of my existence as a woman , I am acknowledged as a part of this paradigm . &quot;
&quot; I , a black woman , can blossom in an environment where my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed , nor ignored or rejected . &quot;
pad@@ dle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a repeatedly travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; explains Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who uses and works to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq and to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was filmed and published in Er@@ bil by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary filmm@@ aker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on neglected , little notable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques with which help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays Women and their difficult fight against violence

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Conc@@ eption . the article is part of the # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er series , which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names were changed to protect the persons involved .
&quot; a Police Commissioner said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ partner who had become violent towards her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the apparent announcement of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez didn &apos;t help . &quot;
a few days later the second wife returned her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women make an announcement at all , they generally do not receive support from the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit to be victims of violence , are in general contact with the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ay@@ an j@@ ig@@ saw and statistics 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that has nothing to do with Paragu@@ ays &apos;s laws : good approach , flaw@@ ed implementation impacts and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to see how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; there are several indications and reports , but they do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney filed a total of 9@@ 600 ads because of domestic violence . 70 % of it was about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the advertisements in the police came from women .
&quot; there were over 5,000 ads of domestic violence in the courts of peace . 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here too . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ardi will actually appear only a few of these crimes . &quot; &quot; on each woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for mental mal@@ treatment , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on any woman who is ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , there are two women who do not do so , &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; as women commit suicide in Paraguay , the prosecution authorities cannot document appropriately how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence through men . &quot;

&quot; conce@@ aled abuse and a legal system , which does not under@@ mine &quot;
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do it , but then gave up . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she bore mental violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious : &quot;
I would never have thought that I would once become a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women would be sub@@ missive , because they dec@@ eive themselves by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the ill @-@ treatment of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing her name , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had dropped so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
&quot; it seemed almost like they wanted to say that , at least , victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in it . &quot;
&quot; Victoria Santos , who was not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was ill @-@ treated . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a process against her former partner , who developed into an im@@ min@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , insufficient implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the announcement of mal@@ treatment is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament discussing the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # für@@ st ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ on@@ e@@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law proposes to explain fem@@ ici@@ des to an independent criminal off@@ ense and to pun@@ ish harder as it is already in the neighboring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the legislative text has been altered in a number of points in order to also win the MPs in favour of the law that may be p@@ aving the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are generally banned in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill envis@@ aged the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which must bear the victims of violence themselves , if they just want to refund and receive safe accommodation to the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective , if the legislature does not provide sufficient funding for it : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in view of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the offen@@ ders get away . &quot;
we have to make such a long announcement until ill @-@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been amended . &quot;
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media released in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a decision taken by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; to be read on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Alb@@ anian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , serving a one @-@ year jail sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and brought to court , but later released . &quot;
&quot; since 1970 , Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sul@@ t@@ ans rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic secret services , public freedoms , including press freedom , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists to persec@@ ute , inti@@ mid@@ ate and incar@@ n@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically limit and prevent citizens , also activists , to freely express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year , is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper since it was founded in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 an article entitled &quot; High ranking parties bind hands of justice . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in a quar@@ rel conflict . &quot;
&quot; issue of the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands to justice . &quot; &quot;
date : 06 / 13 / 2009 Size :
&quot; on 3 August 2016 , he was charged with Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the Legal Committee , from ISS before the Special Department and arrested upon his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS recorded Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as Chief Editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed for an in@@ definite period after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper in any way , including online , is prohibited from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , before the Court of Mas@@ k@@ at , the first trial took place in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted , among other things , for disturb@@ ance of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot; &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a ban on publication and s@@ lander . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison sentences and fin@@ es of 3,000 m ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a security deposit of 5000 om@@ bian ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ oun@@ cement of the Jud@@ gment . &quot;
al @-@ Abr@@ i pronounced the Appe@@ als Court in a hearing on 26 December 2016 but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 for serving his six months sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he is serving his imprisonment .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to leave Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Cuban government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of Az@@ am@@ n by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and thus the Minister presented himself once more against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ als to re@@ strain the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently injured press freedom .
&quot; further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atine and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to susp@@ end its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ bian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Korean authorities to : &quot;
1 . allow Al @-@ Ha@@ j to release immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
&quot; 2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ; &quot;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their ri@@ ghtful human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit , non @-@ governmental organization , human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and the right to assemble , support and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent &quot;
it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site : firstly , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious ram@@ i@@ fications in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment in resear@@ ching these diseases by phar@@ ma companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious impacts on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Louis@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Sam@@ ba health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( dis@@ claimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ arian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot;
&quot; GM : what , in your opinion , are the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ? &quot;
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers instead of being makers themselves . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are being promoted differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
read the rest of this entry &quot;
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special academic education , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social Sciences , Computer Science , Big Data , Study of Space , Health ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : it is often the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges challenges here . &quot;
the system that magazines can only make available against payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ wall ) also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : like &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers changing global food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ gland , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was only set limits due to his own imagination and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents do not only apply to individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or ru@@ ff@@ led leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ on varieties . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a m@@ illen@@ nia @-@ old tradition Mor@@ ton is still breeding let@@ tu@@ ce , but in the meantime he needs longer because his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions . &quot;
it &apos;s like lying in a river a b@@ oul@@ der to whom I must thread .
&quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; I think these patents go too far on salads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of salad because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red ro@@ asting salad of the type Out@@ red@@ gland in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is not by chance that this name sounds more like the move from the IT department and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; Se@@ eds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot;
&quot; it was created in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , thus permanently usable for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US breeders may commit themselves to free use of seeds grown by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others to breed their seeds , to breed their own varieties , and not immediately opt out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the aged professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; it is said that seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot;
food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible .
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit to keep their seeds available free of charge . in contrast , their approach is to patent seeds and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant materials , which is thus becoming increasingly limited , shrink un@@ ce@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ SS@@ I , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all map features are protected as intellectual property , making it suitable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult . &quot;
&quot; such estimates do not exist for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that massive crops such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than salads or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are grown so that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those that improve their taste or color to those , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for gro@@ wers is decreasing with more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are far worse predictable . &quot;
&quot; in an email , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts that intellectual property belongs to other breeders because &quot; patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovations . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees this differently : 20 years to wait until a patent takes place , certainly does not promote innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight already . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want to make farmers work easier .
&quot; this is what motiv@@ ates us , and it is made impossible for us to continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ ed with the concept of using plant characteristics : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants form it themselves and as breeders , we ultimately have no idea how the plants do it . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ arol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US State Oregon and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety , also breeds his own values into it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed , is breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
&quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , they can survive most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they keep it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for salads in his breeding garden .

&quot; Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders would be more innovative through the avo@@ idance of plant patents : &quot; &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know my ri@@ vals sell my grades in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , making it easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide response &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , is working together with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also helps to get to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to experience something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend toward pat@@ enting seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for Open Source &quot; seed systems , declares that the organization is currently building a global alliance for Open Source &quot; seed systems , for which the official starting signal should be scheduled next year . &quot;
&quot; a combination of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world in order to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report published by the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that more people will soon see it . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has paid particular attention to where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we now try to make clear to the people that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

all winners received certificates as a reminder and other prizes such as souven@@ irs with the competition logo or cou@@ p@@ ons for online shops .
&quot; the authors of the 11 photos with the highest jury and competition participants , who were able to collect most of the objects and collect the most points in the overall score , were honoured with the prizes . &quot;
other awards were awarded by other organizations that joined the competition .
&quot; for example , the members of the Hol@@ osi@@ iv@@ sky@@ i Natural Park , located in the Kiev metropol@@ itan area , selected the three best photos taken in the park and submitted for competition . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there were also some special categories in the national competition : &quot; the Other Discovery , &quot; docum@@ enting the destruction of natural habitats , initiated by NGOs from the environmental sector , an overview of the topics , with the photos on Wikipedia missing best wildlife photos and best Kiev photo &quot;

human rights organisations and blog are the latest cens@@ orship &apos;s goals in Egypt
still the Egyptian authorities ban content on the Internet .
this time the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend around the 5th of August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook where it sharply critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; in spite of this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , the Arabic network for Human Rights remains true of defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first licensed website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , for example , the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web@@ pages blocks to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic : https : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no longer available in Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of articles and articles he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog , which he erected to b@@ ypass the Egyptian government cens@@ orship , was even the aim of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the supplier of which is also home to Canada &apos;s blog , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he talked about the student protests and watched a video on how the police trained physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; blocking blogs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and although the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It is possible for them to convey the feeling of a si@@ ege , an arrest , an attempt to murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post items to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; however , after having locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave are going the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities closed on 24 May to 06@@ th August 133 web pages . this gave technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers , through which Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing were possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ PN@@ s offer began . &quot;
such practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content to which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; the situation is compo@@ unded by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis to act against these acts in court . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants dispute .

&quot; day after day newspapers all over Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot at school , &quot; &quot; At the second day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is assass@@ inated , &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es ro@@ aming chem@@ ist with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers from the army , navy and air travel to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio was the highest in Rio for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; on 16 August , the newspaper &quot; Extra , &quot; published on August 16 , published the editorial &quot; Extra , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision were explained by the newspaper as follows :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens in Rio will be published in the category &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , explained that this decision is not a cause for pride but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
an extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ruin in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist tells the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , when it is distor@@ ted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions to cover . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not civilians , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it does ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal , The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ acent neg@@ lect of public service . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital . &quot;

calling Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; is wrong according to Cec@@ í@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is No. 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , acc@@ entu@@ ates the importance of the country &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; this security policy was also included in the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit imposed by the Federal State of Rio in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually resulted in a decrease of violent death cases . however , after several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of chic@@ anes and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles in 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also attracts serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this includes entry into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ touch@@ able point in the landscape and becomes the object of &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost glob@@ es . &quot; &quot;
the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
it is now a week that the police co@@ oned the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : revi@@ ved Syri@@ ans to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories World@@ watch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , there are currently approximately one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib . &quot;
&quot; the East G@@ hou@@ ta region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition , based on studies by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , have been committed to exercising the massacre of Assad &apos;s regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have been under si@@ ege , which led to local residents or tunnels and control points that are sm@@ ug@@ gled through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and acade@@ mics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the diver@@ t of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now gaining more and more awareness . &quot;
&quot; in order to gather money for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da , use the humanitarian crowd funding platform cand@@ o . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to teach 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , as Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of some 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to cand@@ o by Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of fuel scar@@ city , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with &quot; &quot; production of seeds from the regions &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small fung@@ al farm in a tub . as this , they used a larger bathtub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the start of the project and after another 3 months , they have spread fung@@ i everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; break the si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc ) to produce new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women working at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities attached to their home .
he said : &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege become visible .
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for victims of 2017
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested in Portugal on October 21st in many regional capitals and called for justice for the victims of the fires , which were r@@ amp@@ ant in the week before in the north of Portugal . &quot;
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this caused the government to call for a state mour@@ ning last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 frac@@ tures that spread in the northern and central regions of the country , and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite imag@@ ery , approximately 500,000 acres of forest burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter users shared images :

numerous videos are spread on the web and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the predictable tragedy
the aim of the Saturday &apos;s protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as much as possible
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ ally of the Bund der Farm@@ ers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday , they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads that were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the woods of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the form of wood , introduced by the government for serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was sought by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val carries on in the same article published by the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environment organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of readily combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , are spreading to fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems are added to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , seeking information or trying to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it took advantage of its own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time via the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was so crucial that the server was not able to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; in one night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan by the Taliban began . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , was in the Province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say it so , she knew she would no longer see her son - maybe never again . &quot;
in the morning the boy was supposed to break .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ g .
the city of G@@ haz@@ ni in Afghanistan .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ bollah @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt un@@ fail@@ ingly . &quot;
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came ever near@@ er . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country toward Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ qi found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
he worked in a coal mine for a few years . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his modest salary , and went to Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged bags with mort@@ ars , which were heavier than himself , to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; at that time , like today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; commented A@@ shar@@ ep in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked . &quot;
there was no service there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we were not frozen at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran and was preparing for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous passage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church which twice daily distributed food to help need@@ y . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high levels of protection , but it is also true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in more than 3,000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which may apply for months after registration of asylum applications . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ k .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined way of life helped A@@ shar@@ ep to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions .
&quot; after spending several years in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af stuck his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , some of Afgh@@ ans have been created , including shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant is nar@@ rated by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their journey to Italy . &quot;
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s objectives extend far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade and aim to return to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af , with a smile . &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forgot my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces in the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent the half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else .
&quot; he is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development to the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey of uncertainty and doubt , but at the end is stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this trip himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; ne@@ tizen &apos;s report : alleg@@ ations from Egypt allow dis@@ connection of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in jail . &quot;
&quot; he reported about the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el Ada@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the overthrow of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ar Report is an international snap@@ shot of challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian parliament reviewed a draft bill , which fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after regi@@ stering with a government authority . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use social networks , users must register within six months following successful legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website , indicating their full name and ID number . &quot;
anyone who missed this step could be sentenced to six months in prison or to be sentenced to a penalty payment .
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty MPs , is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another MP represented a legislative proposal to introduce the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ults of the President or a high civil servant . &quot;
&quot; under the law proposition , such a deed would , however , be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts from Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this can mean to three years in prison for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would reinforce a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been at risk for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested for the same incident , four years in jail for a trial . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison leadership failed , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , false charges of i.@@ a. weapon possession , illegal assembly , murder and murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the aforementioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian milit@@ ants inter@@ rog@@ ated on sk@@ ill@@ ful documents
&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who co @-@ founded the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly inter@@ rog@@ ated with a negotiated action plan . a deliber@@ ate plan was given by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly endor@@ sed a controversial bill of legislation , which would guarantee the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they all return un@@ law@@ fully preserved funds . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , sheds light on how the presidential agenda will look for the support of the bill . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia dismissed the nom@@ ination of his sources stating the article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he entered the district court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness in the case . &quot;
does China want to force users of social media to demonstrate their identity ?
&quot; according to new rules of the National Council of People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need a permit before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , registration with the full real name will be required in the provisions . &quot;
analysts believe that by this way elimin@@ ates anonymous comments in conversations inside social networks . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only sel@@ ectively en@@ force these regulations in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot;
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia closed up access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat should register with the provincial government as &quot; Organis@@ er of Information Dis@@ sem@@ ination . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a law dating back to 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services that allow the government to be responsible for removing contents and forcing them on request for the removal of user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently web sites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ str@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish dish features Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered the liberation of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to clear two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supported the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry for Transport , maritime affairs and communication gave up that the site had been closed because it was a source of information that collabor@@ ated with groups to address a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked its website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world , where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
great Britain can &apos;t stop to sni@@ ff around
&quot; after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance capabilities that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs , encryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has dismissed other technology companies and the civilian population on the outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until the 19th of May . reactions and proposals from the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of Interior . &quot;
