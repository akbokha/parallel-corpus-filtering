<seg id="1">"although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Brief, a fearless reporter who wanted to occupy the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges, who were interested in his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after Method Man," I was as if it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the United States had only increased."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are, and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very secretive love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how to deal with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain as one says so nicely."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks of, as a former colleague expressed it, and publicly explains his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African American and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted in favor for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he won during the Republican election, was the highest number ever reached by the party nominated by the party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not tune Trump and his voters to the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme that takes people from all over the world, a deeply believing man with whom I talked about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also, the lumps of the world view did not correspond with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at play.</seg>
<seg id="25">"mumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced with Sandy Bahr, who lived for the environment for her lifetime, and Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still adapts to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with lots of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise advice helped me much in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love toward America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump made his way to the nominated republican candidate candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, presided over a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook those things broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it's unfair to call the trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates a inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes are not taken into account in their congregations.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that those voters, most of whom know, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(Anm. d. Ü): as much as" "White against All Other Ethnics" "; word play from white in reference to the whites and Whiplash, as much as the great Van Jones means, has killed exactly what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nonetheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have, America is welcome to everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as his president, twice the son of a Kenney, his story as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the choice of Donald Trumps there is a huge part of the White Americas on this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, had my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd replied with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roared the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "no!" "they answered."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices were louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son fell, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Country, said the news."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find any place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="70">"the music played at both venues not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists, but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now the La banda de música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community that is located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces is known for its abuse and the violence of gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and offered youth such a rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca nvi:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, woodhorn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from waste</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays Capital, on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with regenerated instruments, composed of local solid waste materials, is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all made out of rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician of the children of Catadva, recalls the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach in the same place where parents worked in the garbage. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin-made violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (harmonic landfill sites) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tonnes of waste every year.</seg>

<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="96">These eastern african countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practised solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was then known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it looked at the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal offense of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to take one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority."</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it did not succeed in catching fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay $2 million in Liberia due to looting the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crossed criminal proceedings and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 from the NGO stop Illegal Fishing (underground fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister out of their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this, we have eight countries who are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trust, Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers technical support FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate abempt of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once impeded by bureaucratic obstacles and also by the snail empo, with the information between individual countries circulated, the actions now happen in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there the individual countries can exchange existing licenses for example, news about suspicious activity or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i closely monitors the activities of ships, when they move on the open sea, via satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas, such as suspicious cruising routes, such as those suggesting that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such tests can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a penfreader."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, on the basis of this information, may refuse to accept such ships in their ports. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay punishments, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of Nfds Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to regain estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue, which will lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to illegal fishermen entering Eastern African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, counterfeit licensing, indication of fantasies, fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately utilise the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an unbridled control system," "says Long." "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say 'You dared not run my port'."</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">"up to now, the closed front is working."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspicious vessels."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had shared fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found refuge ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency to fight crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to accurately detect suspicious vessels.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and we try to cross this, "says Duncan Copeland, head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and offers technical support FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"for this reason, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i will help to find criminal acting vessels with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team can indeed influence the global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, together with Google and the Oceana marine protection organization, SkyTruth has launched the Global Fishing Tour platform: a platform that offers satellite data, and the position of every single trackable ship worldwide can be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join our neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what they are doing - this simply makes sense," "he says." "here's a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project where a global system permits the pursuit of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also frighten them."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which used to be fishing earlier without a license and hardly had to deal with consequences now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats have purchased more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found the inspectors on board tow nets where they were forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars will disappear every year by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"six countries have joined forces in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i.." "security is the goal of leaving even more such initiatives and structures even in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia could report his first big triumph: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship that was travelling under false flag."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship has also entered into forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the conduct of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works across the entire world sea. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes about the environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he commanded me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in which cars, furniture, TV, fridges - were all possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and commanded me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great lump of silver in it."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were put off and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sewed in and saw a couch that people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the person's body that was just tied there.</seg>

<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>

<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much pain to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed</seg>

<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi, Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra. "</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying face down - all were tied at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people squatted quietly on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you look like, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why did you get me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, there were some rooms designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero made a man there and killed a man.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanizing.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came that they should be laid."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'war-prey'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought home all sorts of stolen things.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time I had no idea what the "war prey" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was at the military later, - I was in the gendarmerie - I realized that war yield was a bayonet, or perhaps military points, that one took off an enemy that was fought."</seg>

<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my dad could do that.</seg>

<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>

<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought clothing back home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defence of me accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay my burden on what they wanted."</seg>

<seg id="296">Why children kidnap?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day my father brought a girl home, whose mother was killed."</seg>

<seg id="299">"I asked myself again and again: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">They could have simply put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was just decided to kill these people, but why their bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not have families to whom one could pass their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abominable act that can be done to a man.</seg>

<seg id="307">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to clarify: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">"I just said the truth about 20 criminals, including my father."</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought of showing my father was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the widespread dissemination of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to translate it, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and to transmit active language skills in order to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ English as their mother tongue, who could translate the translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"however, some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations themselves internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the wording and enigmatic sentences, which are produced by mechanical translations, show that this technique can't replace any human translators for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling overprints, which often adorn t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery or at least harmless. however, by large companies or by the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians recently agreed to draft legislation on "regulating regulation on use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if it is accepted by Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "on the basis of the law a place would be set up, which is commissioned to give citizens a permit to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with the adoption of the law, users must register on the site with their correct names and identity numbers in order to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if this fails to do so, it could take a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fines of money."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, consisting of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" jedwede application that runs and used across the Internet to communicate with others by voice, video messages and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how the Egyptian authorities are able to impose their registration on how the Egyptian authorities are not able to register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation at the level of Social Media."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Member of Parliament and supporter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and a password to get through the firewall connecting Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt plans to make a firewall around Facebook on a national level. because of those, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not been known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>

<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just like they have forcibly control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter people who seek approval or not. and that is a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to supply them to a trial."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt all is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament's legislature and the constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military thought in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximised and should be ensured that no diverging narration is present on the scene," "says Raoof."</seg>

<seg id="526">"a subtype of the larger family of leopards wanders through Africa and Asia, belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor)."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza picks up in the video, the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem, and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem will also depend on a large predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard actually in the free game is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>

<seg id="544">"at the beginning of March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for the Northeast of Japan, documented the progress achieved over the last six years in order to restore the lives of those affected by the" triple disaster "of March 2011. a massive earthquake, tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima occurred."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a major prefectures in Japan's Northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring prefectures of Fukushima and Iwate were forced, because the tsunami had let whole coastal towns disappear from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the prefecture Fukushima still experienced a nuclear accident, alone because alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"from a local perspective, the Kahoku Shimpo report shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (" Signaling "," saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate. "</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to achieve the greatest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 per cent of such houses, while Fukushima makes its final light at 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"at the same time, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behelfsunterfeits (" "Sun," "kasetsu juutaku) still endeavour to relocate into final replacements."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple disaster, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, still 36000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 percent of the evacuation from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 percent of the evacuation infiltrated after the disaster in makeshift shelters were resettled in final homes."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the figure here is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by accident, opened its doors by December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial rebuilding in the three prefectures is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 per cent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the atomic accident, in the three prefectures of agrarian land, have suffered enormously in the three prefectures of agrarian land."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi recovered 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of arable land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farmland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima are located in the" nuclear wave zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima still remains far away."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level, as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to obtain an overall picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and under the evacuation. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and how her feeling changed vis-à-vis the tsunami jeopardy."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures taken to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its issue for the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to witness not only the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the 2017 stand, 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuated ones who are still living in temporary shelters are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020."</seg>

<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were paralyzed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">"the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the skeleton of steel and concrete remained."</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are concerned with themes that are important to them. they do so by hip-hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop managers have brought mobile studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song writing, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by educators David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked together in Northern Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop thus increases that young participants in talks like" cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a road section in western Canada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not explained.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences caused by globalisation."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs have been published in indigenous languages, although the young people don't always know the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the youngsters involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar Hip-Hop group, who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcript, as well a translation into English, translated into German here:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in myself</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, will be exhibited close to the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (" "Greetings'," "Plastics Models of the Courts"), which is served in this restaurant. "</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see themselves in these plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a large number of these small companies that produce those sculptural dishes, which the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented more than 20 years ago in his film Tokyo-Ga."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they don't even see them anymore. however, a new trend turns them into showy mobile phone accessories and other gadgets nowadays."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">"now in special sale: new vinyl wristbands decorated with plastic bags, as shown at the Kichijoji Tokyo department store."</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods were turned into kitschy collectibles, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridges magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food trends is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">"in this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile-stand."</seg>
<seg id="730">"for this triangular bowl (lol), we found a good use as a mobile-stand."</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part was made for the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple containing your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile and mobile designers allow you to produce your own work of art. in this case ikura or salmon have been used, a popular topping served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">Some users had their doubts on Twitter:</seg>
<seg id="737">"there is someone who would say," "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with laughing cheers?" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic bags can also take a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasantly."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handybelts made of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you can view more skurrile plastic dishes at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #,"</seg>
<seg id="743">"if you want to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports in- and foreign media about the notorious" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the missing and killed workers regularly appear in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looking at the mourners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"for this reason, the Mexican news portal animal Político has launched the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" learning with the drug trade "), which tells these victims a voice and narrates stories of people involved in the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, if businesses close because they are threatened by drug traders and therefore whole communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of the Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear changed life") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on only one day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves, according to the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric business in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th, he should be back again, but he never came back." Emma Veleta said: "it is very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but she does not pay it off because they demand a certificate of death."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get here? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the Federal State of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what shape it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known sickness and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I am coming to newspaper kiosks every day and see the cover pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from experts of specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug trader), if he's big. and it's also not normal that people listen to songs about the" "heroic deeds" "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me this is as if they mock those that have lost someone, and those who are afraid that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">"I see our weakness, if stories become mere figures in a statistic."</seg>
<seg id="788">"the insomnia of men is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town can be justified" that they were "gilded." "</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to convince themselves that they remain spared by such tragedies, if they are not touched and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months blackmail in the main city district: how a family was spoilt for month money from their business, until they destroyed not only the business, but also tore their family apart. "</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything that you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain on it never fails, the trauma remains, the fear comes again high if you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, telephone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are apart from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report in the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because they don't know when they are kidnapped or killed."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these terrible days I wondered whether crying would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings, but the response is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is an orphan and he says that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, warm tortillas warm and" "chichi" "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells about the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">"however, they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it."</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was over two years earlier, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"born in Bryan, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence through organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Prosecution had 3103 murders. this corresponds to average 8.5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">"these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico, which penetrates into the soul of the country."</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político 2015 created the data journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is to illustrate the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country in the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank car traversed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated it. the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes, which were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank car fell victim to the victim."</seg>
<seg id="828">"officials described a fireball, the dozens of houses enveloped, including a movie nearby which was full of people who watched the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses routed and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burnt to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">"an image with the title" That is Nigeria. "from the Imgur-User Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident will form the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">There are rows of charred bodies that are lined up on the floor while individuals are watching them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was raised several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015 combatants from Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and corpses were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "no one stayed behind to count the corpses," "said one of the inhabitants of Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were crushed, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the following time could be portrayed figuratively."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo emerged again when it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and the potential scale of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">You are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the picture from DR Congo is only one in a number of misdepreciation; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the image was brought forward as a proof for mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments, such as this example, falsely link the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a blitz, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee blows, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this image comes from an Saudi Arabian news site, which in 2012 claimed, the President Myanmars Thein Sein reported that monks and politicians had taken part in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the picture from DR Congo to picture this information."</seg>

<seg id="936">"one argument is that refusing images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that forcible images desensitise readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study which investigated how violent media seem to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about forcible depictions in the news media, it is fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>

<seg id="1143">"while often associated with it," "these events" "instead" "offer these events" "listening to appreciate, feel, socialize."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers imagine their story in their own language and translate or explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their dedication and representation will lead to readership."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotion as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows, for example, a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which is told in Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassimenou preserves the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"on 3 April 2017, several religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration with the aim of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took place on April 3, 2017 in the capital city of the capital city, and went to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">"it was proclaimed by the grouping" "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" "(Citizen's Front for Neurorisation of Debt) and the Roman Church Convention Puerto Ricos."</seg>
<seg id="1157">The intercessors of the refixing of the debt also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their requirement:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people Puerto Rico asks that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debt are held accountable for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial audit and an executive committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed remuneration that acts in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Rico refuses to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be deterred with declining pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not in the confession of an integrated sovereign territory - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"hence the so-called" Centre for New Economy, "an independent non-profit organisation without party affiliation with a focus on socio-economic development, proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to existing state supervision."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"without the participation and conviction of citizens, measures imposed on the outside will be jeopardized by the people."</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is freely available here, contains a number of papers dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"in the introduction, it is said:"</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book aims to discuss how Movements for Free Knowledge can be built and what is the real cost associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to find out about the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">"his name was cancelled out of the directory of the Adra prison, in which he sat on 3 October 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, immediately."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture, many of us have started thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of time-wise extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in detention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military institution."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police bassel on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military court took part in his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that they were contacted by people on November 12, 2015, who themselves presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, its place of residence and condition remains unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a key role in extending the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes was more forward-looking than the work that he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations, and here the Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time Bassel couldn't know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything on this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria, but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this journey into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent all my life in dreaming of freedom, and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I have learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners as they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a Prosabuch that she wrote to her husband in 2012-2015 when he was in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura spent a year on the book together.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"she smuggled the lyrics to him, when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English."</seg>

<seg id="1255">"after half of his sentence, a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus at which the corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 due to a good lead and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General's Office of the Republic who rejected the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to regain his old posts, since the company did not conduct disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not call the action good."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Safety (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in view of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company would also have to initiate a disciplinary procedure against the contradicting ones.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company apparently was silent, however, and did not initiate appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "disgusting" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had been left."</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid lectures and motivating speeches and he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent he has consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza will love to be paid for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Reluctant!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"bitone Viage, young Mosambian and student of political science in Brazil says, the director has no moral:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he swore it, I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks the return of morality and serving the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has only served himself in the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as being an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself is tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term."</seg>

<seg id="1287">"the Burmese word" "Kalar pae" "means chickpeas or splitting basses."</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported "</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censuses the word" "Kalar" "or" "and" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely dissipative connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims that represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of useful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"'Kalar' may be associated with racism today, but the word in itself does not automatically call to hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about his use, were censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"moreover, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair on Burmese is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (alternator), 'Kalar OAT' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The FacebooButzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"but he asked his friends in a witty way, if they knew how to alleviate his back pain, making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" "cure" "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech radical nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook has to be more analytic before releasing all posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on a facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words side by side.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," "Kalar Hectins" "(chair) and" "Kalar pae" "(alternating balls)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech have received a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to curtail their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all who spread hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts, when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was aware of this new Facebook policy, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to delete posts and parts of content for 24 hours because the mail" did not meet the Facebook Community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech away from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his views on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will bring even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they started this without a local context or technical support and banned words such as" "chair" "or" "peas curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not attempt to correct the wrongly deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they would have more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Chromebook's automatic censorship provided a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which contained no hate speech but were still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>

<seg id="1336">"in the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally involve violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticised for its failure to bring up the proliferating hate speech on his Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of just censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better in context than focused initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1345">"prior to this change of the marriage network, some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities adhered to practice, and in May 2016, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere, because the age does not determine maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"this happened notwithstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN Children's Rights Convention, the minors as," every person under the age of 18. ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">"the UN statistics for 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago amounted to 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the country's statistical central office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married to 19 from 1997 to 2007."</seg>

<seg id="1352">"this type of religious opposition ensured tension in this uncomplicated situation, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against childbirth - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, who could be discussed so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>

<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV-series fight against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use bypass tools for blocked websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking article by Wikipedia since 2008, as recently posted in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (No. 5651) has been adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"after China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (sites that mirror the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform cleared all Turkish Wikipedia-pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer computer-links), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"in spite of the legal ban, the content is available."</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after listening to the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we set everything to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the contents in a decentralized and distributed way."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia sites, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org."</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also admitted that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation and it is only Screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror-page from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors if Wikipedia is banned in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>

<seg id="1411">"in essence, the server redirects the query to the correct Wikipedia Site, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself then if they are locked in Turkey."</seg>

<seg id="1417">"Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him, they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and full-washed colors."</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Nepal strives to bring Nepal to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Nepalese animals."</seg>
<seg id="1422">"he described on Facebook, how this first-class situation helps in his work:"</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">"when suddenly Navaraj was calling me (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge), he had received a call from my father that was a leopard on the banks of the Rapti river."</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I started off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to take pictures!!"</seg>
<seg id="1428">"Sagar aims to co-operate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature, and would like to deepen understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look."</seg>

<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" "I click for conservation" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to shoot in the Bardia National Park shots of Otters. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women are avoided with the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of the social pressure and the fear of the consequences they should respect the norm, maintain this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced from the Indian state of Odisha by a fake court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives also does not call their names, is also widespread among men. however, they have far fewer remittances to fear, if at all which, they should not meet this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Waler in Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel, and housewives, became a unique club and thus quickly became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign that is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Paine has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and guides these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion session was women who did not call her husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to talk about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women could identify easily.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"to pronounce the name of their husbands out loud, is a custom that they all entitantly maintain and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not keep this, is considered as deceitful, as a woman without morals."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning Rohini, who has never been named her husband by name, wanted to try at home at home as it is going on."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, affectionate and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked everyone," If we can't say the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that mean they don't respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands over their lips," said Rohini Paist of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of an age-old tradition, in which married women can never speak the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy, that during the whole exercise she was just ahead of herself; another decided to let the whole host of frustration come out against him and his family by cursing him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in the adrenaline rush about having broken with an age-old custom, the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini has received a lot of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another member of the club decided to do it for dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she got scared and said it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports on how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinc-red dot on the forehead that shows the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women just have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the interest-red dot if he did it as well.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not ceased entirely, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip to each discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women to worry about who could hear what," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the past few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and spoke about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things such as our identities tied to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most people this is okay, but some wanted to wear a Saloon short, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, morals connected with the saris and much more, the Rohini smuggled their own pair of Curtas (upper shirts) in a discussion round so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"the question, whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed somewhat, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into the roll:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tested it a few times but then stopped telling the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like slipping around more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells people about what we're talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" Subversion "(State of State), having participated in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the State Department in China has called Lius case as an" "internal affair" "and a spokesman told that he did not consider it as" "not required to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nonetheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or allow him treatment abroad."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmuamalgam, Singapore should be regarded as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the Minister noticed that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one asked whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "twist the logic" "in order to defend the existing authoritarian regime of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, one hears that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmuiden were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal states' in the face of that, he appeared inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old lyre of the authoritarian rulers appear again, who pretend to be democrats, leave the distorted logic because it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end the last week of Shanmuamalgam gave answers to his American guests with regard to our press, our judicial, our political system, really no answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disgusted such questions with non-responses of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng calls on Shanugam to clarify his opinion, since she did not understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country is our city belongs..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmuamalgam would take the effort to clarify this point, provided he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his comment on the blog, he points out on the critics that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmuamalgam as Singapore is a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore is rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said to Singapore," "No country," "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmuiden, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice has said of Singapore,..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmuamalgam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it, associates and is aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review disintegrates the weak points of Shanmugams' arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Has Mr. Shanmuamalgam "made a mistake" or was it a Freudian advocate?</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, what country do the sovereign rights of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since it plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmuise are of serious significance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but do they not defend their city?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our prime minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>

<seg id="1729">I didn't say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many Singapurans...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>

<seg id="1745">"my clarification often follows the standard response:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians are perhaps cooking inwardly with anger when they are kept for Americans, but I don't mind that."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know himself, there is little difference between Americans and Americans."</seg>

<seg id="1894">In Mexico "Mama Africa" hosts migrants on their long journey</seg>
<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez runs a small hotel in Tapachula, Chiapas State, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"this article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with kind permission."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula and is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals-pink frame and gold coloured earrings in teddy bear."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is, Concepción González Ramírez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 Dollars per night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, the people come to full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying out:" "Mama Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mum Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"currently it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have slept on cartons even outside."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she helps them and brings her to the hospital if they are sick, she buys them drugs that they cannot pay, she massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui who has a yoghurtbart) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he replies with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her, because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston, to find her husband and the three children there."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move northwards."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa." "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans are often travelling along the way and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil before working as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for several months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he replies, smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian belief is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have picked up migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are being sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them to get an appropriate price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking area outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have seen what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States following a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown, single traveller, offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the courses, the travelers consult quietly their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests; a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she blends in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair-stains she has made her a female, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she introduces her to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats it every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users,"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in the West of China, are forced to install an spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10th, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi City were receiving a mobile phone notification in which they reported the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" Web cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app is intended to prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group shortly after they had installed the app."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police said that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a security service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reports about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often dim for those who live in remote, oppressed ethnic regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, authorities often associate extreme censorings and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet searches."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlet for Twitter based media outlet" Images from In China "(" Greetings in China "), which censored the censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint at which policemen checked the residents indiscriminately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiano ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use appliances intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the use technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from" "China" "(" "Companyard" ") also published a Jingwang product description, which indicates that the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system, thus receiving unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after the Jingwang installation, computers and cell phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the city council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and affiliated institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office while operating their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of Urumqi's regional capital to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards "at the local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist videos. "this action, however, violates the personality rights of Urumquis, three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="2059">I didn't answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to it not to respond.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can really no longer say exactly when insults and blows have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>

<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which has been part of them since 1967; the year when Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine, where they lived as felted (about: farmers)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their old-proven views on gender roles, sexuality, and freedom of expression through art and rapture."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the heart of the whole Arab world. all these topics are not only relevant in his hometown Amman relevancy but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking, and he can feel with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he won a special dislike against US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," "stresses Hdaib."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a human being, "as the Nescafé dissolved in water. it is the holy month of Ramadan. at this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a sensing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the pieces speak lukewarm coffee and the waders of the Kent-cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if you have a look into neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to avoid basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan said a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontship hamed Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert evening."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"in an interview with CNN, the members and former spokespersons of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said that the concert was" straight "cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free speech in the Arab world is a dangerous activism, which poses the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as a" progressive supporter of human rights, "who continue to use intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should probably not be simply a rhetorical rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly clear-crystalizing reality in Jordan that clearly appears in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returned to traditional sex men, by completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently stomped unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women, who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, the number of" honorary killings "has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still more difficult to support the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence, in an appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on combating crime in 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence are often held in prison for an indefinite period of time, and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucracy as well as the guarantee provided by the family that nothing will happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known to not shy away from topics, which are long as taboos in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he is not able to separate his music, which is full of explicit reference to sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics was denied to me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and" ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the kernel can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which you can get what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone talks about the rights of gay men and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were censored in 2014 until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to later point out that his comments were torn, twisted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed was only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib acquires openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not entail Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nui, who was later to work on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why cannot Jordan be this?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, Jordanian Intelligence recorded several former government deputies and members of the teacher's association with the reason they had critical comments in social media critical to the problems rooted deeply in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the Hdaibs concert is reportedly only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant grasping and taking. Jordan has prevented Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's how it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thankful and inner changes."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience" it. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is approaching a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, scattering and artificial democracies."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to act and therefore resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big and extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one supposes that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the feasts, the drums and dancing come from a period of time, in the armies of the West of Japan to the northeast, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the disciples, to their knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is hard to imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been watching the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two vans are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and yet a breathtaking way to spend its summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2167">External appearance and body care have rarely been as important as in this story because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">"Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street smoking and illegal drug trafficking are common."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of the region did not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, experiences rising demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go to the skilled hands of hairdressers who can recreate these intricate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts play against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos about current competitions can be found on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their arms against hairdressing tools and receive training in hairdressers, which enables them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">"before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes:"</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: declaration of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not much more important, people who feel pushed out, affection affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this is precisely the question of the young Colombian militants Leonardo Párraga donated by the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired her to campaign Cartas por la reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write errilla fighters letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla war FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signatory of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"before the Colombian people there is still a long way, until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrillacists, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to war rhetoric and were carrying their arms around the clock, must now integrate themselves into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"in turn, Colombian society, who has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now record them in their ranks and support them in building up a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrillas to welcome them back in society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - who are to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for reconciliation emerged at the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"he explained that we write to the people we love, on Valentine's day thousands of love letters, but those who need them much more needful."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people, who needed the most urgent appeal this year."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of war history a common history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia including Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN stockpiles in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotart Foundation traveled to the camp to convey the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were up as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "explained the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a staff member of the governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, a former warrior led me by the camp of the guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a sort of hut in which the guerrillas live) I saw a guerrilla fighter, who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down because beside him on the bed lay a MGL-grenade, a lethal weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I spoke to him anyway and asked," "Hi, what are they doing right now?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before in my life somebody wrote something so nice, so I answer it."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the grenades.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was suffering the war too, was sorry to be all the years of loyal companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation." "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the start, students and some leaders of the FARC were joined to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already a war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC announced the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the state worked towards the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party, we can help shape society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worth overcoming all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never heard a hearing and had no voting rights, and to realize that people I often had seen as a monster and even hated people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - even those who have been killed and have done so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"for example, Gustavo González, the camp's commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of Cali, Archbishop of the town of Cali:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">Colombia has been prophesied that after the disarmament there would be peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to take up arms, raise themselves and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now putting peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who uphold life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with terror, activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months about the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs over the LGBTQ community over the local LGBTQ community has not only emerged overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman of Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what has happened in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has won the international headlines several months ago, after reports published that addressed the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milazina in Novaya Gazeta; she cast a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world,"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a Transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had learned of the sex equality of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"out of fear for their lives, they ultimately moved to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend of Dagestan, a Transwoman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me."</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents passed the round through WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was going to show a few shopping bags from the backseat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," Here is a gift for you from your uncle. ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I did not hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" how long do you want to dishonour the family, you are deflexing? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I know only that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything along and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two stings in my right lung wing."</seg>

<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, my male name is still on it; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful to him for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time on his office door, I got it to do with the fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I received threats."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they asked absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running through the streets on the top of the street; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny, and say that I didn't change my sex, that all was only bad talk, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," You brought a monster to the world not only your family but the whole republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we can't touch you because you are a devout woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"my mother was too much, and she laid a snare around her neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it had happened for the third time, I realized that there was a little lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends reviewed the number signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you escape?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering, without notice, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plugged the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I asked my mother to call on WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't think you're safe, just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"but we don't talk about the gender equation, this is a taboo subject."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements are still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, this spiritual barrier cannot be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with the camera, I really try to see how the person looks at which she recalls from her past - that is, to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have remained dormant?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for him, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has imprisoned one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan no man was arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">They will most likely concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so I mean, they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so-called" "honor" "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend of mine said, there were not many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all, those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to settle Gaddafi's court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there, so that they can be presented as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply vanishing, but specifically submerged in order to radicalize themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">"since then, there has been nothing new about them."</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to so-called" "non-traditional" "orientation have already occurred in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think that before 2003 I was already known in Grosny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia wanted to lead us to" "civilisation" "originally, but finally dumped us back into the stone age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: what is possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed eyelashes, wearing both jeans and short Tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never hurt me even a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theater in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, met a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in Chechnya language there is a saying: Kharma ma Kharda. that is," Don't talk about the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so, did they just keep their eyes closed before you because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never harmed me, never hunted and never struck."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began speaking on television about morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but above all about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could sense how people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed at first looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic was steadily worse."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what action do you do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organise teacreffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't want to cents for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I rattled the type of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you have a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chetschens, who want to prophesy to you with foam in front of your mouth that there are no gay men."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the cabardins have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims going into the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know many think about transidentity to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling, to be exact, different attitudes towards life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry, I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide in the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong increase in suicide."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 met the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness that incapacity for his family could arise, so Ahmad human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Talegade hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Jamahiazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have imposed this month."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family patricians who felt helpless and unable to feed their families, and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region in which a large part of the Arab Ahawazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arabian Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi-monarchy had taken power and in 1925 attempts to end ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz Region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the local population receives little of this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime is systematically denied the Ahwazi Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of tribes, the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian lands where provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to aggravate the devastation caused in the region, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general manager for co-operatives, work and social welfare, announced that 5% of the Ahwazis who are seeking a job, completed the primary school, completed 55% a secondary school and 45% had a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohihimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohihimi said that unemployment has become more recently worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of new ethnic Persian and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will be deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance by young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living from their home Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their pros and surnames to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and so be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activist alert the alert before the situation is explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with feminism, also with the intersectionalen"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminists *.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men nowadays."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms continue to cause women to face a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and discrimination based on gender is still going through the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"I am convinced, and I suffer double and triple among them."</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, if I come to speak on skin color, on racism, black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused under racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but nevertheless, everyone agrees that women - all women - should come together to" "lift up their voices" "and" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "to achieve equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalized form of racist motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in a twofold nature.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and countries earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background more often be referred to the school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women are exposed to higher risk in black spheres and women with a migration background, domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't associate myself as a black woman, in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to take injustices in her mind, which involve both the gender and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women again and again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"sojourner complained in 1851 in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman is a shameful and marginalised entity in the historic sense."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which, moreover, by cultural appropriation absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to expose white women the importance of overlap of skin color and gender. for some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to reward them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word" feminism "still is in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to get rid of feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which is so persistent for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weem, the author of the book" Africana Hisanism: Reclaiming ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how we ourselves regain ourselves) speaks of how we can defend ourselves in this way, where they are completely safe and can be revered by the cultural, mental, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements that make up the black woman. "</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures because within this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">"because of my dark skin and on account of my existence as a woman, I am acknowledged as a part of this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can blossom in an environment where my life is neither bypassed, nor ignored or rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2467">"this post by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">Nabil Musa repeatedly travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in canoe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child," "explains Musa."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeeper Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who uses and works to protect the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq and to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we had no water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was filmed and published in Erbil by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist based in Erbil, Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work lies on neglected, little notable subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques with which help suppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">"the following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article" The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay "by Conception. the article is part of the # PorSerMujer series, which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the persons involved.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a Police Commissioner said Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her expartner who had become violent towards her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman showed Balbuena for mistreatment, the apparent announcement of Ada Báez didn't help."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second wife returned her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women make an announcement at all, they generally do not receive support from the State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this explains why only 20% of all women, who admit to be victims of violence, are in general contact with the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"Paraguayan jigsaw and statistics 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that has nothing to do with Paraguays's laws: good approach, flawed implementation impacts and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to see how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay." "there are several indications and reports, but they do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay" "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the figures available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Attorney filed a total of 9600 ads because of domestic violence. 70% of it was about violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were over 5,000 ads of domestic violence in the courts of peace. 86% of women's ads came here too."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi will actually appear only a few of these crimes." "on each woman who is refunded in Paraguay for mental maltreatment, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on any woman who is refunded because of physical abuse, there are two women who do not do so," she stated at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"as women commit suicide in Paraguay, the prosecution authorities cannot document appropriately how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence through men."</seg>
<seg id="2503">"a sign with the inscription:" "without complicity. # Nononess" "photo by Jessie Insfran Pérez. use with kind permission."</seg>
<seg id="2504">"concealed abuse and a legal system, which does not undermine"</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"at the beginning she didn't want to do it, but then gave up."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she bore mental violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would once become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women would be submissive, because they deceive themselves by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the ill-treatment of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming her name, she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had dropped so long by Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost like they wanted to say that, at least, victims of abuse had at least some complicity in it."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was ill-treated."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a process against her former partner, who developed into an imminable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguays laws: good approach, insufficient implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the announcement of maltreatment is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "says Victoria Santos."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament discussing the hashtag # Porelas (# fürst)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# NononeLess) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law proposes to explain femicides to an independent criminal offense and to punish harder as it is already in the neighboring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"in this way, the legislative text has been altered in a number of points in order to also win the MPs in favour of the law that may be paving the way for decriminalisation of abortions that are generally banned in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: like "Open Source" seed producers changing global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding lettuce in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgland, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was only set limits due to his own imagination and the question of how many kinds of lettuce he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents do not only apply to individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or ruffled leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or carton varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition Morton is still breeding lettuce, but in the meantime he needs longer because his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's like lying in a river a boulder to whom I must thread.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "he says." "I think these patents go too far on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of salad because all the characteristics are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and endeavours not to use any material protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding (Open Source "breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red roasting salad of the type Outredgland in the "greenhouse" of the station. there is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is not by chance that this name sounds more like the move from the IT department and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for" Open Source "Seeds) is inspired by the movement for free" Open Source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was created in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, thus permanently usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"within the framework of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders may commit themselves to free use of seeds grown by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others to breed their seeds, to breed their own varieties, and not immediately opt out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the aged professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"it is said that seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "Open-Source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commit to keep their seeds available free of charge. in contrast, their approach is to patent seeds and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant materials, which is thus becoming increasingly limited, shrink unceasing."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of the OSSI, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all map features are protected as intellectual property, making it suitable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"such estimates do not exist for other plants, but experts like Luby suggest that massive crops such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than salads or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are grown so that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those that improve their taste or color to those, because of which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for growers is decreasing with more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are far worse predictable."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an email, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and decisive for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property belongs to other breeders because" patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovations. "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees this differently: 20 years to wait until a patent takes place, certainly does not promote innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight already."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what motivates us, and it is made impossible for us to continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interfered with the concept of using plant characteristics:" we don't really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form it themselves and as breeders, we ultimately have no idea how the plants do it."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US State Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" whoever breeds a variety, also breeds his own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation mass herbicides are needed, is breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"my concept is exactly opposite." ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that are moving on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) patents, they can survive most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patenting or they keep it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative through the avoidance of plant patents:" "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know my rivals sell my grades in a few years," he says. "with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years, making it easy for my opinion." worldwide response "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, is working together with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also helps to get to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol is working on an" open source "license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, therefore the OSSI obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not a law; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to experience something about the" open source "seed movement and the global trend toward patenting seed."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for Open Source" seed systems, declares that the organization is currently building a global alliance for Open Source "seed systems, for which the official starting signal should be scheduled next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a combination of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world in order to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report published by the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Luby of OSSI hopes that more people will soon see it."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has paid particular attention to where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role," says Luby. "we now try to make clear to the people that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2731">"blogger, the supplier of which is also home to Canada's blog, is further accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he talked about the student protests and watched a video on how the police trained physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"blocking blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and although the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It is possible for them to convey the feeling of a siege, an arrest, an attempt to murder, unloading at the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) They have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post items to circumvent censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after having locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave are going the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities closed on 24 May to 06th August 133 web pages. this gave technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"afte also documented the blocking of providers, through which Internet censorship and private surfing were possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs offer began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content to which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is compounded by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis to act against these acts in court."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day newspapers all over Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old was shot at school," "At the second day, a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is assassinated," "thieves roaming chemist with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers from the army, navy and air travel to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio was the highest in Rio for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"on 16 August, the newspaper" Extra, "published on August 16, published the editorial" Extra, "in which she announced a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision were explained by the newspaper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that happens from the civilized standard and what happens in Rio will be published in the category" "War in Rio". "(...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, explained that this decision is not a cause for pride but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">An extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ruin in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist tells the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions to cover."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not civilians, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it does?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal, The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">"as a reminder, the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital."</seg>

<seg id="2777">Calling Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil" is wrong according to Cecília: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north-east of the country. these are the most up-to-date data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>

<seg id="2780">"the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, accentuates the importance of the country's security policy for years."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"this security policy was also included in the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit imposed by the Federal State of Rio in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually resulted in a decrease of violent death cases. however, after several years, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of chicanes and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles in 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also attracts serious consequences for the people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this includes entry into the territory of a" enemy, "in which a civilian is an untouchable point in the landscape and becomes the object of" collateral damage "and" lost globes. ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">The fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is now a week that the police cooned the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victories Worldwatch, a joint initiative of the peace organisation PAX and the Research Institute The Syria Institute, there are currently approximately one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition, based on studies by the United Nations and other human rights organisations, have been committed to exercising the massacre of Assad's regime."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, which led to local residents or tunnels and control points that are smuggled through tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"due to the years of blockage, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas as they can plant their own mushrooms as a" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the divert of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we chose cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now gaining more and more awareness."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"in order to gather money for the initiative, in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda, use the humanitarian crowd funding platform cando."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to teach 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms, as Dr. Leila becomes Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the Constitution of this article they have reached over 100% of their expected target of some 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to cando by Monday, 04 September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of fuel scarcity, locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with" "production of seeds from the regions" "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small fungal farm in a tub. as this, they used a larger bathtub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the start of the project and after another 3 months, they have spread fungi everywhere in East Ghouta free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>

<seg id="2833">"several hundred people protested in Portugal on October 21st in many regional capitals and called for justice for the victims of the fires, which were rampant in the week before in the north of Portugal."</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this caused the government to call for a state mourning last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Brandies were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fractures that spread in the northern and central regions of the country, and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy happened in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite imagery, approximately 500,000 acres of forest burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So you can get a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2848">"after Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>

<seg id="2851">"furthermore, building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal for the form of wood, introduced by the government for serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was sought by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed the construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self-protection - that was an open door, so that everything could be built," João Sorval carries on in the same article published by the newspaper Público. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environment organisation Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of readily combustible wood, like in a vicious circle, are spreading to fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems are added to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16, seeking information or trying to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it took advantage of its own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time via the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial that the server was not able to withstand the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2874">"two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups that had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus, Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair."</seg>
<seg id="2875">"at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, belonging to the ethnic group of Hazara, was in the Province of Ghazni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner."</seg>

<seg id="2884">"Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezbollah-e-Wahdat, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt unfailingly."</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came ever nearer. "</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country toward Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharqi found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked in a coal mine for a few years. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his modest salary, and went to Iran. once again, he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged bags with mortars, which were heavier than himself, to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," commented Asharep in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we were not frozen at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without documents in Iran and was preparing for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous passage on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Asharaf was homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks, and went to a church which twice daily distributed food to help needy."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seekers due to relatively high levels of protection, but it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in more than 3,000" special reception centres. "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which may apply for months after registration of asylum applications."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Ashark.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained way of life helped Asharep to liberate himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after spending several years in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf stuck his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now the theme of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2915">"over the past few years, some of Afghans have been created, including shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>

<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," "says Asharaf, with a smile." "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I never forgot my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people suffer.</seg>

<seg id="2941">"Shawkan was waiting, like more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested for the same incident, four years in jail for a trial."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed on 20 May, because the prison leadership failed, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan is threatening the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, false charges of i.a. weapon possession, illegal assembly, murder and murder."</seg>
