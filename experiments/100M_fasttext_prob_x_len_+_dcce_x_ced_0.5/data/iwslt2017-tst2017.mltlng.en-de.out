this is James Ris@@ en .
you may know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before any one of Edward Snow@@ den had heard , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA heard illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in it , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally sur@@ rendered dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an unbelievable story .
but do you know whom the chapter did not like ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has decided against cr@@ acking and called upon him to name his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and to spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish cover@@ t information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones they want . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courage@@ ous repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en has been living with the risk of going to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although for years it was essential that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped in tears . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources can hide himself less and less .
&quot; instead of reti@@ ring and ris@@ king to statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , kept their phone calls secret , &quot;
&quot; just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its loans , and even travel tips with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA @-@ whist@@ leb@@ lower and crack . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of its work as a secret one . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whist@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just like the government &apos;s technology allowed to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do so from the moment they come into contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that didn &apos;t exist yet , when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source conversion system for whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; you can upload or send documents there , just like any ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , which only has the respective news agency access . &quot;
&quot; so the government can no longer collect information secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the start . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se all of us . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology denom@@ in@@ ators such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to do mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whist@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
&quot; who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers , knows and wants to report about crowded hospitals . or the next environmental contribut@@ or who raises alarm for contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ elle Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works , how it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s let@@ ter@@ box firm has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is said that a trace of US $ 2 billion leads to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , through a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous about the next release , and on the next unveiled documents . &quot;
this sounds like the plot of an agent pen@@ it@@ ress or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should this approach us ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for major public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people all over the world seem very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ uting and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are less reports of this matter in the USA .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because up to now there were no prominent Americans who occurred in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans , who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle behind these tax ha@@ v@@ ens , Mos@@ elle Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have ties to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is true that in some US states one needs less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
sc@@ amm@@ ers are allowed to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice .
how does it work ?
&quot; so , we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
it really shocked us that everyone to a lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ators how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was handed over to anybody . however , the problem with this system shows . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; it is not about a single leader , wrapped up in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , established by corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
&quot; that may sound quite tri@@ cky , as though we could do nothing about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and the powerful . &quot;
but as a secure optim@@ ist I see quite a lot to change .
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen a few steps towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has been regi@@ stering in central regi@@ sters on a national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have proposed legislation in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , will be used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us in global weather this is a moment of change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
we need leaders in the economy to stand up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders who recognize the problem and use laws to end this type of in@@ transparency . &quot;
&quot; together , we can finally finish the in@@ transparency which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , how I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da . &quot;
&quot; one day after completing my design studies , I made a back yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my master@@ pieces .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . after that he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake question him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to end up in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; um , how do you please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling , and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get in ? &quot;
a stranger sleep@@ y in my living room .
what if he is mad ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sh@@ ud@@ ged on tips to the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
&quot; maybe the people , who were sold to me as a stranger in childhood , were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; being on my air matt@@ resses was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am job@@ less , almost pl@@ ump , my ro@@ ommate is drawing out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ ommate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and thus established &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
&quot; they found it super , and we too . &quot;
I &apos;m sure that our cheese @-@ smoked O@@ mel@@ ette ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and me star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into the roll .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if this could be a business concept .
&quot; we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can invite non @-@ foreign people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; nobody , who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children all have learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , one gets to the things you can do well . we could design . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who never met before . &quot;
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree confidence we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
add your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left hip neighbour .
this quiet flight of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; in this way , most of the guests feel if they stay overnight . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so who now has Al Gore &apos;s cell phone ?
could you please announce to Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I &apos;d like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told him from wh@@ ence he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you had 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really hold on very well un@@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
for a well thought out feedback system confidence is crucial .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had handed down their assessments before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we studied how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are about age and residence .
&quot; surprisingly , we trust people most who are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it gets exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case through jud@@ gments .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stems from simil@@ arities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply buried preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much one price is . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; as for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your home &quot; . &quot; I make a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on what topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
&quot; what we did not expect was the great deal of people , who were more than willing to abol@@ ish these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a demand that had not been met before . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business is running very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have devast@@ ated homes .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . I &apos;m hur@@ ting when I just think about it .
&quot; the disappointment you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller , was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve . &quot;
fortunately of the 123 million overnight stays there was only a fraction of a problem .
for men trusted one another .
&quot; when trust works , won@@ dro@@ us can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect home for travelers who tend to tend to heart attacks because of sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they do not know one . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by . &quot;
they can stay even longer without calcul@@ ating extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the thought of participation harmon@@ ise with money transactions ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; but it is now just called &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel today , this is comparable to fast food . it is efficient and reliable but less authentic . &quot;
&quot; what , if travelling , would be a rich buffet of local impressions ? &quot;
&quot; what if at any place you visited , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub craw@@ l area of which you have never heard of ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to create apartments from the ground up to the co @-@ operation ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of joint participation ?
I imagine cities which allow us society and relations instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and sealing .
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that the government included , &quot;
now they were offered residents . students looking for a place to stay were offered .
&quot; were medi@@ ated to people whose children were dra@@ fted , incub@@ ator programs have been started , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . on our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea does not seem to be so crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also a kind of hospitality before .
there were already similar websites .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we noted that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
date : 06 / 14 / 2009 Size :
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da travels to me .
of course we know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if we could help if it had this great impact , I wonder what we can use for the future . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a Beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in check @-@ in check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a se@@ ag@@ ull fitness fan@@ atic , &quot;
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born that way . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 , I made the decision to ou@@ ten myself . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head covering . &quot;
&quot; my feminist friends were app@@ alled : &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , in contrast to the pressure I felt as a 17 year old , to adjust myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; had you ever felt that someone you perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started as all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast in the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking News . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people jump@@ ed out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned rapidly into rebellion .
why should one do such things ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; , &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the n@@ u , the deeds of others turned me into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I sat down -- as we drove sil@@ ently -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was first afraid to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; Don &apos;t be dec@@ eived . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
&quot; then it was Friday , that week -- the day when Muslims congreg@@ ate for prayer . &quot;
&quot; and again the warnings reported : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims , or by people that were held for Muslims to drag and beat them . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have got the rage of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing to ask , I love questions . &quot;
these are the accus@@ ations that are tough .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want Muslims ban@@ ish and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as from a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , not a tumor in the US body , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are the invent@@ ors and teachers , ear@@ chers and Olymp@@ ians . &quot;
is the closure of mos@@ ques America safer ?
&quot; there may be a few parking spaces free , but do not stop the terror . &quot;
regular visit to a mos@@ que leads to more toler@@ ant people from other fai@@ ths and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ approved by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we need to stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imag@@ inary world if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups maintain their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when one looks at them , they do not exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the Scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding im@@ am recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ erg@@ y@@ man with whom she spoke , sil@@ enced her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that makes sense of their anger , it was a main objective for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution . &quot;
this im@@ position restored the connection to God and its church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed her constructive ways of a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mos@@ que , she protected her to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family were concerned .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , to our freedom of thought ? &quot;
&quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ academic studies -- show , if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian system of government , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : when people report messages in which negative reports were reported about Muslims , they were more likely to vote for military attacks on Muslim countries and circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood sw@@ elled against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terrorism , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
Muslims constitute an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot;
&quot; with the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ f and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they went to school . &quot;
De@@ f was an ath@@ lete .
&quot; he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the most sweet@@ est , generous person whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when has been such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . &quot;
he was shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ atic@@ ism cannot be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely practise our religion . &quot;
we decided for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went into the building hall , and what I saw left me . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thanks and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to join us . &quot;
at that moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion ech@@ o@@ ed pan@@ ick@@ y and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ atic@@ ism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think that we are better than that .
many thanks .
thank you .
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say to those who might claim that you are holding TE@@ D@@ Talk , a ment@@ or with drau@@ ght , working in a noble think tank , i.e. an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you don &apos;t dec@@ eive . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as ordinary as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I &apos;m not an exception in any way .
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , is about to become a billion dollar business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air parcel service penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France was built live in front of the audience a six meter high tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks . &quot;
&quot; by joining together , air devices reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ extrac@@ table structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry bur@@ dens , deal with turbul@@ ences and generally react to laws of nature . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in an autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to autonom@@ ously work autonom@@ ously , it must be collec@@ tively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at E@@ TH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands can be found on the highest flat@@ . e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a flight device trying to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and thus has great advantages in the start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind bows .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device will be able to reg@@ ain optimum position and improve performance by practicing .
click &apos; Insert Before &apos; button and &apos; Publish
&quot; during our research , we often present basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft flying only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a ru@@ d@@ der . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flies are functioning with just one . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ d@@ der , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , in the interior life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move in the room over everywhere . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear beam . to get it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it exactly right , if all watch me is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in nau@@ sea , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
that &apos;s why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability to &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some can be adjusted in models , the rest is learned directly at flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
it turns into clock@@ wise direction
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly , albeit limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate this now by fli@@ pping half of the aircraft .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the larger number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where space it is and is self @-@ controlled . that &apos;s why there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the very safe machine since dr@@ abs would like to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us is the wage in the development and the act of creation .
&quot; it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cled around each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , so the mass of three suns conver@@ ged in a tenth of pure energy . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , they lit more bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe . &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not set them free in the form of light --
&quot; finally , we speak of black holes . &quot;
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time fabric themselves and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events in a timely manner .
&quot; more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life on Earth was born . &quot;
&quot; since then , the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stands for us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; some 25 years ago , a group of particularly courage@@ ous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a giant laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them considered it crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work , they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the Laser interfer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of the Lig@@ o could be substantially increased , which improved the recognition output enorm@@ ously . &quot;
therefore it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , lig@@ o was started for a last test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes have been scre@@ ened through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the par@@ ting of my to@@ d@@ ling father .
&quot; basically , these were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is a cur@@ l in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and punched into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lec@@ turers in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a correctly al@@ ber@@ ing dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on the 14th of sep@@ t@@ ember , for example , each of us was stretched out at the arrival of the waves and st@@ ew@@ ed . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the League of Lig@@ o employees for mad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than one thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of a nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive , and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 @-@ 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott says that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by seeing the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
&quot; in the case of kill@@ ings , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean you very much : &quot;
about your child &apos;s face .
&quot; instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now just Alice is speaking . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; stupid Bob &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we transform wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot;
&quot; listening to gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has occupied himself for a very long time . &quot;
&quot; sh : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circul@@ ate simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; the two bodies are turning very fast , listening to the same cir@@ cus with an additional key change . this sounds like W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o the following : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; No somebody who knows what he needs to hear , recognize this as a noise from -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn around as quickly as the rods of your Mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est bodies in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the lasting significance of Lig@@ o .
&quot; Lig@@ o p@@ aves an entirely new way to explore the universe , as it never was possible before . &quot;
on this path we can listen to the universe and listen to the invisible .
much in space we can &apos;t see -- virtually or basically -- not .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful .
&quot; the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through because these op@@ aque are .
&quot; gravity waves penetrate Iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the Big B@@ ang is obsc@@ ured by its own lumin@@ aires . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I &apos;m optim@@ istic that in All things we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening . &quot;
in fact Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect .
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o observed them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are the su@@ cking bones for our archaeological work , so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different angle of view of events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as courage@@ ous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories : a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of big dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried out an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; , &quot; before which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a definite yes , which changed my life , to an unexpected kind . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for un@@ expl@@ ain@@ able reasons all &quot; &quot; kit@@ ties &quot; , &quot; &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; bi@@ bs , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ cup . &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from then on , I always swear to play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I am doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully realized that the &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; sag@@ a to play with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am an author . I think things come out , stir you to life . &quot;

I scre@@ am television . I produce television .
&quot; I do television , in great style . &quot;
in this TV season I &apos;m responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three or four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days of four shows , i.e. every nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run after each other on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so it is even more obsc@@ ure . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who else does it ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;

I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
&quot; I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you are working a company , a country or a class room , take a business or a household , take me seriously , and it is true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming at a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I go into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is as I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as if you had a high sound , run a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and rational . and the best thing about it is the sum . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I declare to them the sums , that I &apos;m writing to writing that writing gives me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it . &quot;
&quot; but the bu@@ zz -- when I started with television production , when I began to work and work , to create , create , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . the sum is a drug .
the sum is music . the sum is light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can no longer strive for size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of not being able to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I &apos;m not do@@ omed for failure , and I know only that I love the sum . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you that I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more work there is , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country that I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the sum@@ ming , the sum@@ ming , the sum@@ ming . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the sum .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I only this sum ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ done , burned out . &quot;
the bu@@ zz stops .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single stit@@ cher .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
it is the children of a tit@@ anic .
they are baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum@@ ming stopped . &quot;
the hum@@ ming of the engine st@@ alled .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out .
the hum@@ ming did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no bo@@ asting .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV @-@ programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a showcase Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the sum I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you are doing , the work you love suddenly f@@ ades ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; how@@ l yourself , stupid author Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you are doing it , you are working , you love what you &apos;re doing , a ban@@ ker to be a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how the bu@@ zz feels when the sum stops , who is one then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; presents me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late next , and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I want to say no , when two things are aware of me : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to all and secondly , she called me no &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot;
she doesn &apos;t call anybody any more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I hate it when I am Titan and my sums are rou@@ gh@@ ed , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum , I can do nothing , except to guard . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the country that I create , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist k@@ is@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it comes to letting go , or whatever the girl lets in &quot; Die Figure Queen . &quot; &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum comes back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the bu@@ zz , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the sums of work , the titles of titles , that is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using broad@@ casts and television lessons and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sum is no force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real hum@@ ming is dependent on love .
the sum is the current that comes from the lust of life .
genuine sum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; genuine sum@@ ming ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , anticip@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real hum@@ ming is simple and original .
&quot; true hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me I am a titanium ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that as a work@@ ah@@ olic , I can free myself from any guilt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice as long as I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in games , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
I don &apos;t think about playing as much as they are working .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at home than at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a man rather works to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am very relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we r@@ ust around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we do small dancing parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mainly rigid , absent and confused . &quot;
I always g@@ imm@@ ick for my mobile phone .
date : 06 / 14 / 2009 Size :
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! always say yes when your child wants to play with you .
&quot; perhaps you feel na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream . &quot;
&quot; you probably are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie will replace me .
&quot; and speak my te@@ ens daughter about 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , there is no more need . &quot;
&quot; each can take 15 minutes a bit , even in a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes per piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children make ready . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . they do not have to be the children . it is important to feel the sums , to have a place for peace of mind . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy
to &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and store it yourself .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I fail and I win . meet friends , reading books , enjoying the day -- &quot;
want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to out@@ perform myself more and more .
15 minutes per piece why not allow full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself again in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinners with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the sums of life .
the bu@@ zz of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and for that I am so grateful . &quot;
it &apos;s snow@@ ing me that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who plays travel to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and to more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clearly my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ ming , the more this unusual , inspiring , naked and new attitude towards life in me is wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am an author . I think things out , I wake you up to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ am@@ like .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and to more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
that is why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
&quot; they certainly have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ planted an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons circuits so that neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ cure . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
history began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that at skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma the brain sw@@ ells and the skull print rises .
&quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce skull pressure . &quot;
sometimes you need to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children , which are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , moisture and the surroundings to flour@@ ish . &quot;
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François abol@@ ished . &quot;
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells , which can turn into each cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they were slow and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they account for 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ar cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we don &apos;t know .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so sure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
&quot; we are facing a potential cell source , which enables brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ speaking area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then color to color in order to be able to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we stri@@ pped them to the confin@@ ement of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we spread these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we spread the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we spread the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added an injury and spread exactly the same cells and now the cells continued -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were ran@@ ged .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in the culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor @-@ motor @-@ area in the motor@@ ic cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to humans , they spontane@@ ously recovered to some degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some degree , just like the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left you see the monkey that spontane@@ ously recovered .
it can provide approximately 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before the injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see when we spread the cells : the same monkey , two months after the m@@ plantation . &quot;
I can tell you that was also very exciting for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze it and use it later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream still is to im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ate them in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can take this . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical studies involving human beings . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these fantastic results , one has to fill two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this kind of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; at first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select patients , to conduct the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multic@@ enter study . &quot;
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West do a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable in@@ ability .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved dou@@ bt@@ less that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while policy remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for true democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save ourselves democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are w@@ asted , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; Twin To@@ wers Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that casts his long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt mountain , &quot;
but few recognize its twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is to be fear@@ ful to invest it where it would be productive and income that could produce the debt and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past three months , in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , billions of billions of dollars have been invested in all the prosperity of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rail@@ ways , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; $ 3.4 tril@@ lion US Dollar sounds much money until you compare it with the $ 5,@@ 1 tril@@ lion dollars spent at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except stock exchanges and selling real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ gering wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in an endless loop , advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which would be true that his son would kill him if he grows , &quot;
un@@ inten@@ tionally causes the circumstances that cause O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; his extremely wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to saving the Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and poor as a majority control the government .
&quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , included too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy on account of these exclusi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the crucial point of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it referred to the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive that they gave them the right to political co@@ determination with the same vote weigh@@ ting in questions of the state of affairs . &quot;
Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been held for a long time --
&quot; like a candle that shines bri@@ ghtly , it is burnt out quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , today &apos;s liberal democr@@ acies have not rooted their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthening the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; for liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s democr@@ acies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place by gradually sub@@ stit@@ uting politics and escap@@ ing them . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because it can be in the government nowadays , and still not in power because the power of politics is mig@@ rated to the economy and the areas are separate . &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that have so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it nour@@ ishes itself , that they end up star@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that has chann@@ eled politics so far that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods will be de@@ valued , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the directors of corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the extravag@@ ance of human labour power and prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy back together and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; re@@ tains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist Left already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not matter very well .
&quot; the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is one solution : abol@@ ishing the working poor !
capitalism is doing it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by autom@@ ating and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , autom@@ ates the twin peaks above , the waste , and the social conflicts lower , as it is -- very soon as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ structure the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re @-@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ etic monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; Matrix , &quot; or something that is similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; style utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples shortly . &quot;
&quot; in the company area : please introduce yourself a capital market in which you earn money , while you work and in which your capital succe@@ eds you from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income from capital and from revenue , and the concept of wage labour , is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work therein , and employees who work there , but no exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up @-@ to @-@ the @-@ end twin summ@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in the sphere of global political economy , please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos , &quot; and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to put it into practice .
&quot; today , we have them , in particular against the background of a re @-@ united policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe to you is also the Liber@@ al in which it pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labor in the wast@@ eland of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine a true democracy . &quot;
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we not do that , technological development will create such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies , but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as well as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a Liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : in fact , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have very clearly said what you think of the West &apos;s view to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it pic@@ ks up -- the area of the economy -- is a fully democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain sense , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake .
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
it was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
&quot; what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to blame China now to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself , sm@@ ells tremend@@ ously after hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experience as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I think that is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back for the first half of the year six months later ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to adopt us from compl@@ ac@@ ency and persistent den@@ ial that a massive fault line passed through the euro@@ zone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal - who , by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro@@ group , continue to den@@ ounce the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries an economic system that is not viable to sustain life through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it might be delayed for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes are you looking for ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance or any Minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for renewal of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders &apos; sides to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the fault that passed through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; no one from the Troika of the credi@@ tors who imposed this policy on us , was : &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone doesn &apos;t survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the liber@@ ated tile forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be dis@@ astro@@ us for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we permit ourselves to strike the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it seems to me , it will also be bear@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you will be wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you very much for having you at TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; from Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
that goes back to the decision the Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon studios , &quot;
the TV production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an identity hair@@ style and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for picking the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t pick any of them .
&quot; he must find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this corner . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the site , IMDB . the review goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review . &quot;
&quot; will your show score with nine and above , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted to where after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what goes off at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price isn &apos;t worried about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to supp@@ ress &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the medium output , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t delight . &quot;
so he has to make sure he &apos;s really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch everyone for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon doesn &apos;t publish things for free , one is attacking , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know they are watching at watching these shows . &quot;
they are being watched by Roy and his team who take up everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ps or watch again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Repub@@ lican U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot;
&quot; it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about the same time with another company another manager placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different . &quot;
&quot; instead of staging a contest , he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give to the shows , their course , which shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a car and decided not to have a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; you have two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work in all .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by a very powerful computer .
&quot; what you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so , this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time where we have more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond the television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact with it you are in prison .
&quot; if someone is in jail here in the US and asks for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not a discharge is made . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; medi@@ oc@@ re television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a firm like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data of se@@ ven@@ est companies are also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can predict data analysis explo@@ sions from flu , bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year by year until it suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the release in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data from most experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flows into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people use un@@ imagin@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized several patterns about the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you basically do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , put the items together again to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help break down a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to put the pieces together again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is to put parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why I think that Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , why they would otherwise not have been able to do so . but the decision on how to take all these pieces together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they would take a big personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they compet@@ ed for TV ideas , then chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; &quot; This is what we say . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the tool for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Java or no question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I &apos;ll get it out later with a demo demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hind@@ sight . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace it with much more wis@@ er than data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; perhaps the ball becomes wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data , it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you .
