<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before any one of Edward Snowden had heard, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA heard illegal telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally surrendered drafts for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an unbelievable story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter did not like?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has decided against cracking and called upon him to name his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn Whistleblower and to spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish covert information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones they want."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen has been living with the risk of going to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although for years it was essential that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped in tears."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can hide himself less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of retiring and risking to statements, this could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, kept their phone calls secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its loans, and even travel tips with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-whistleblower and crack."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistle-blowers, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of its work as a secret one."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just like the government's technology allowed to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do so from the moment they come into contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that didn't exist yet, when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source conversion system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"you can upload or send documents there, just like any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, which only has the respective news agency access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer collect information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the start."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that jeopardise all of us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology denominators such as Edward Snowden have a way to do misdeeds. it is equally important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who knows about grievances in the supply of soldiers, knows and wants to report about crowded hospitals. or the next environmental contributor who raises alarm for contaminated water from Flint. or a Wall street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Moselle Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, how it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad's letterbox firm has in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a trace of US $2 billion leads to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, through a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous about the next release, and on the next unveiled documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">This sounds like the plot of an agent penitress or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this approach us?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for major public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people all over the world seem very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecuting and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are less reports of this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because up to now there were no prominent Americans who occurred in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now it is not that there are no rich Americans, who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle behind these tax havens, Moselle Fonseca has fewer American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have ties to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is true that in some US states one needs less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Scammers are allowed to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that everyone to a lawyer made proposals to our investigators how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was handed over to anybody. however, the problem with this system shows."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single leader, wrapped up in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, established by corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"that may sound quite tricky, as though we could do nothing about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and the powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a secure optimist I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen a few steps towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been registering in central registers on a national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have proposed legislation in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, will be used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us in global weather this is a moment of change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy to stand up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leaders who recognize the problem and use laws to end this type of intransparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finally finish the intransparency which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, how I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after completing my design studies, I made a back yard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my masterpieces.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. after that he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake question him:" "where do you sleep tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to end up in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard say: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "um, how do you please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling, and thought," Oh man! what did I get in? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleepy in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, shudged on tips to the door, and my bedroom door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classrooms. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe the people, who were sold to me as a stranger in childhood, were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"being on my air mattresses was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am jobless, almost plump, my roommate is drawing out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I think about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and thus established "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRB aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it super, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure that our cheese-smoked Omelette tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and me stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if this could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented to the investors:" we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can invite non-foreign people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody, who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children all have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, one gets to the things you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree confidence we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Add your unlocked mobile phone to your left hip neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"in this way, most of the guests feel if they stay overnight."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so who now has Al Gore's cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce to Twitter that he is channeling for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I'd like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told him from whence he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 judgements that all say: "he can really hold on very well unlocked cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">For a well thought out feedback system confidence is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had handed down their assessments before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we studied how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are about age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">"surprisingly, we trust people most who are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It gets exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case through judgments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply buried preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust depends on how much one price is."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"as for example:" "I have problems with my mother" "-- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "Tolle works of art in your home". "I make a holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on what topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we did not expect was the great deal of people, who were more than willing to abolish these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a demand that had not been met before."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is running very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have devastated homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. I'm hurting when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment you hear in the voice of the caller, was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately of the 123 million overnight stays there was only a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trusted one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, wondrous can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect home for travelers who tend to tend to heart attacks because of sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they do not know one."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can stay even longer without calculating extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay will expire."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I first stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of participation harmonise with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now just called" "rental industry", "the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of themselves open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, this is comparable to fast food. it is efficient and reliable but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"what, if travelling, would be a rich buffet of local impressions?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you visited, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub crawl area of which you have never heard of;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to create apartments from the ground up to the co-operation?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take the thought of joint participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities which allow us society and relations instead of loneliness and sealing.</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that the government included,"</seg>
<seg id="240">Now they were offered residents. students looking for a place to stay were offered.</seg>
<seg id="241">"were mediated to people whose children were drafted, incubator programs have been started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. on our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be so crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also a kind of hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we noted that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">Date: 06 / 14 / 2009 Size:</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda travels to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if we could help if it had this great impact, I wonder what we can use for the future."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A Believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashing, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in check-in check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to get to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a seagull fitness fanatic,"</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born that way."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17, I made the decision to outen myself."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab, my head covering."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were appalled:" "why do you suppress yourself?" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, in contrast to the pressure I felt as a 17 year old, to adjust myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, posed in question, doubted, and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion that deepened with each reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"had you ever felt that someone you perceives you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started as all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast in the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" breaking News. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned rapidly into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such things?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the TV channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "..."... "..." "Jihad...", "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country being attacked, but in the nu, the deeds of others turned me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I sat down -- as we drove silently -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I was first afraid to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved this night into our apartment, in a new city, in which it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" be alert, "" Be careful, "" Be careful, "" Stay in well lit areas, "Don't be deceived."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then it was Friday, that week -- the day when Muslims congregate for prayer."</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings reported:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims, or by people that were held for Muslims to drag and beat them."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have got the rage of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing to ask, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are tough.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want Muslims banish and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as from a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, not a tumor in the US body, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are the inventors and teachers, earchers and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Is the closure of mosques America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be a few parking spaces free, but do not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit to a mosque leads to more tolerant people from other faiths and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or disapproved by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we need to stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginary world if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups maintain their ideology on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when one looks at them, they do not exaggerate what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergyman with whom she spoke, silenced her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that makes sense of their anger, it was a main objective for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This imposition restored the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways of a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she protected her to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight how the Islamophobia and my family were concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, to our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">"one study -- actually several neuroacademic studies -- show, if we fear, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian system of government, conformity and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: when people report messages in which negative reports were reported about Muslims, they were more likely to vote for military attacks on Muslim countries and circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look when the mood swelled against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terrorism, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Muslims constitute an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"with the assignment of collective guilt, it is not only about having to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Def and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they went to school."</seg>

<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the most sweetest, generous person whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "when has been such an accomplished young man from my brother?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon."</seg>

<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely practise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, pulled out my shoes, went into the building hall, and what I saw left me."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanks and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion echoed panicky and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>

<seg id="411">You can also build self-extractable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry burdens, deal with turbulences and generally react to laws of nature."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in an autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to autonomously work autonomously, it must be collectively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands can be found on the highest flat. e. g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>

<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters it can float, and thus has great advantages in the start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as wind bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device will be able to regain optimum position and improve performance by practicing.</seg>

<seg id="430">"during our research, we often present basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft flying only two movable parts: a propeller and a rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flies are functioning with just one."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simple remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, in the interior life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move in the room over everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear beam. to get it to fly, I have to throw it exactly right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of throwing it exactly right, if all watch me is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in nausea, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That's why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the extraordinary ability to"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is rotated or even rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some can be adjusted in models, the rest is learned directly at flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">It turns into clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, albeit limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now by flipping half of the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the larger number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where space it is and is self-controlled. that's why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The very safe machine since drabs would like to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>

<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>

<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled around each other in a very far distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns converged in a tenth of pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">"for this short moment, they lit more brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not set them free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">"finally, we speak of black holes."</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time fabric themselves and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="476">"more than 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life on Earth was born."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stands for us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"some 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- decided to build a giant laser detector to search for gravitational shafts, which are caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them considered it crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work, they built the Detector Ligo: the Laser interferometer- gravitational-wave observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up period, the precision of the Ligo could be substantially increased, which improved the recognition output enormously."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is now called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, ligo was started for a last test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, just a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes have been screened through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the parting of my todling father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, these were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT."</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation wave is a curl in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and punched into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustration, lecturers in courses on the theory of relativity often lead to a correctly albering dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on the 14th of september, for example, each of us was stretched out at the arrival of the waves and stewed. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the League of Ligo employees for madness."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than one thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive, and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973-42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott says that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because so you can make a picture or a map of things by seeing the light coming from several points around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in the case of killings, this is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean you very much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just Alice is speaking."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "stupid Bob". ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we transform wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to gravitation can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has occupied himself for a very long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"sh: two black, non-rotating holes, circulate simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"the two bodies are turning very fast, listening to the same circus with an additional key change. this sounds like Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo the following: [Surrender sound] No somebody who knows what he needs to hear, recognize this as a noise from -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass, which turn around as quickly as the rods of your Mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest bodies in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling one hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">"Ligo paves an entirely new way to explore the universe, as it never was possible before."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and listen to the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can't see -- virtually or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes happen at the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravity waves penetrate Iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it since the Big Bang is obscured by its own luminaires."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I'm optimistic that in All things we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, like Ligo observed them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are the sucking bones for our archaeological work, so to speak."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo gives us a completely different angle of view of events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories: a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>

<seg id="564">"my fear to keep talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away."</seg>

<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>

<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I do television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I'm responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three or four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days of four shows, i.e. every nine days 20 million dollar television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shows: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run after each other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so it is even more obscure. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Porn-Movie with SexySamira</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it because I know what you think, when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you are working a company, a country or a class room, take a business or a household, take me seriously, and it is true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreaming at a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I go into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is as I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as if you had a high sound, run a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and rational. and the best thing about it is the sum."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzzing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I declare to them the sums, that I'm writing to writing that writing gives me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, that does it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buzz -- when I started with television production, when I began to work and work, to create, create, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sum is action and activity. the sum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sum is music. the sum is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzz, then you can no longer strive for size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling of not being able to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I'm not doomed for failure, and I know only that I love the sum."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you that I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more work there is, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to succeed, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country that I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the summing, the summing, the summing."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sum.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, overdone, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mommy is a single stitcher.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mum won't be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a titanic.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby-titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the summing stopped."</seg>
<seg id="649">The humming of the engine stalled.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The humming did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium does not sleep, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no boasting.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV-programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a showcase Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sum I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you are doing, the work you love suddenly fades?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "howl yourself, stupid author Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you are doing it, you are working, you love what you're doing, a banker to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how the buzz feels when the sum stops, who is one then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" presents me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way out, late next, and she says," "Mom, do you like playing?" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I want to say no, when two things are aware of me:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to all and secondly, she called me no" kitten. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She doesn't call anybody any more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I hate it when I am Titan and my sums are roughed, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mom, do you like playing?" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of the sum, I can do nothing, except to guard."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country that I create, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it comes to letting go, or whatever the girl lets in" Die Figure Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sum comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the buzz, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the sums of work, the titles of titles, that is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself using broadcasts and television lessons and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is no force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real humming is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Genuine summing is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"genuine summing ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, anticipation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real humming is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words, for which God told me I am a titanium?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that as a workaholic, I can free myself from any guilt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice as long as I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in games, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't think about playing as much as they are working.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at home than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, because what a man rather works to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan. ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am very relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rust around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we do small dancing parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mainly rigid, absent and confused."</seg>

<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! always say yes when your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"perhaps you feel naïve, for a daydream."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you probably are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or cookie will replace me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teens daughter about 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, there is no more need."</seg>
<seg id="752">"each can take 15 minutes a bit, even in a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes per piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children make ready."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. they do not have to be the children. it is important to feel the sums, to have a place for peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy</seg>
<seg id="759">To "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it yourself.</seg>

<seg id="764">Want to play? "is short for everything I gave when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to outperform myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes per piece why not allow full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return when I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself again in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinners with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>

<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and for that I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snowing me that I am a Titan. I've never seen a Titan who plays travel to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the more happier I and my children."</seg>

<seg id="786">"the more I feel this summing, the more this unusual, inspiring, naked and new attitude towards life in me is wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am an author. I think things out, I wake you up to life."</seg>

<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamlike.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and to more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they certainly have heard of one of the most well-known, the" deep brain stimulation. "in doing so, one implanted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the neurons circuits so that neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease which suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-cure."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that at skull-brain trauma the brain swells and the skull print rises.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, it is necessary to reduce skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you need to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children, which are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find proper nutrition, temperature, moisture and the surroundings to flourish."</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François abolished."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells, which can turn into each cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slow and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They account for 4% of our cerebellar cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we are facing a potential cell source, which enables brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-speaking area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then color to color in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we stripped them to the confinement of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we spread these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we spread the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we spread the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and spread exactly the same cells and now the cells continued -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were ranged.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor-motor-area in the motoric cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen to humans, they spontaneously recovered to some degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some degree, just like the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide approximately 40% to 50% of its original performance from before the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see when we spread the cells: the same monkey, two months after the mplantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implantiate them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can take this. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical studies involving human beings."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these fantastic results, one has to fill two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this kind of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"at first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select patients, to conduct the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, it is necessary to apply this to a multicenter study."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West do a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable inability.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved doubtless that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while policy remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment, I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present you an economic model for true democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save ourselves democracy, but that we need a true and defenseless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are wasted, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "Twin Towers Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that casts his long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize its twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which is to be fearful to invest it where it would be productive and income that could produce the debt and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past three months, in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, billions of billions of dollars have been invested in all the prosperity of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, railways, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"$3.4 trillion US Dollar sounds much money until you compare it with the $5,1 trillion dollars spent at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except stock exchanges and selling real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is staggering wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, as in an endless loop, advocates the pessimism of investors, which would be true that his son would kill him if he grows,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances that cause Oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his extremely wasteful art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial to saving the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">"the Athenian democracy, of course, included too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of the athenical democracy on account of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the crucial point of the Athenian democracy was and is that it referred to the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive that they gave them the right to political codetermination with the same vote weighting in questions of the state of affairs."</seg>
<seg id="935">Athenian democracy has not been held for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that shines brightly, it is burnt out quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, today's liberal democracies have not rooted their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthening the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two is taking place by gradually substituting politics and escaping them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because it can be in the government nowadays, and still not in power because the power of politics is migrated to the economy and the areas are separate."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that have so sustainably decimated the animals from which it nourishes itself, that they end up starving."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is with the economy that has channeled politics so far that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods will be devalued, the macroeconomic demand falls and the directors of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism drives the" demos "of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the extravagance of human labour power and prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy back together and it would be better if the" demos "retains control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not matter very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new forms of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolishing the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by replacing low-wage workers by automating and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automates the twin peaks above, the waste, and the social conflicts lower, as it is -- very soon as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to restructure the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the re-united area, otherwise we end up in a pathetic monitoring hyperautocracy that makes the film" Matrix "a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in" Matrix, "or something that is similar to the society in" Star Trek "or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like to have this "Star Trek" style utopia instead of the "Matrix" similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples shortly."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the company area: please introduce yourself a capital market in which you earn money, while you work and in which your capital succeeds you from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all income from capital and from revenue, and the concept of wage labour, is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work therein, and employees who work there, but no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no up-to-the-end twin summits."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the sphere of global political economy, please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging markets], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the Cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos, "and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to put it into practice.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, in particular against the background of a re-united policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe to you is also the Liberal in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labor in the wasteland of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world in which we can imagine a true democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... do we not do that, technological development will create such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers describes as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as well as Hayek, that's why I am a Libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am also perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: in fact, and now we are."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have very clearly said what you think of the West's view to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it picks up -- the area of the economy -- is a fully democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain sense, if I can say this provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">It was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to blame China now to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself, smells tremendously after hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experience as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I think that is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back for the first half of the year six months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to adopt us from complacency and persistent denial that a massive fault line passed through the eurozone and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal - who, by the way, was the first suggestion that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Eurogroup, continue to denounce the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries an economic system that is not viable to sustain life through political will and authoritarianism, it might be delayed for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes are you looking for?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a Minister of Finance or any Minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for renewal of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders' sides to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they just wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the fault that passed through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"no one from the Troika of the creditors who imposed this policy on us, was:" "this was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive Tons of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone doesn't survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if it does not survive, the liberated tile forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we permit ourselves to strike the path of a post-modern 1930, after which it seems to me, it will also be bearable for the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you will be wrong at this point.</seg>

<seg id="1038">"from Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision the Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an identity hairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for picking the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't pick any of them.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the site, IMDB. the review goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"will your show score with nine and above, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addicted to where after watching a season, your brain asks:" where is there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- that should tell you enough what goes off at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price isn't worried about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to suppress" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the medium output, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't delight."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure he's really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch everyone for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon doesn't publish things for free, one is attacking, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know they are watching at watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are being watched by Roy and his team who take up everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skips or watch again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican U.S. senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about the same time with another company another manager placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of staging a contest, he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give to the shows, their course, which shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, what actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a car and decided not to have a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"you have two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work in all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by a very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good TV, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so, this is a bit scary because we live in a time where we have more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond the television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact with it you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in jail here in the US and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not a discharge is made."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"mediocre television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a firm like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of sevenest companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that they can predict data analysis explosions from flu, bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked flawlessly, year by year by year until it suddenly no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the release in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data from most experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flows into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized several patterns about the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you basically do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, disassemble this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the items; as a second, put the items together again to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help break down a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the pieces together again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is to put parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that's why I think that Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, why they would otherwise not have been able to do so. but the decision on how to take all these pieces together and make a show like" House of Cards "does not stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they would take a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they competed for TV ideas, then chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision because they could always say," "This is what we say."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the tool for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Java or no question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll get it out later with a demo demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in hindsight."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace it with much more wiser than data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"perhaps the ball becomes wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
