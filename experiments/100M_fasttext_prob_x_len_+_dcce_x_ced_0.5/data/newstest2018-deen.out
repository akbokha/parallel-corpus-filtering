Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
&quot; an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are to meet today . &quot;
&quot; a cryp@@ t chapel , where now it is du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small gar@@ den@@ ers cultivate the former cause of peasants .
the oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to days .
it is annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows everybody who had to get upset because the car navigation device instead of a moving road showed a green meadow .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but precisely for this reason very enligh@@ tening . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Münchner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work carpet that you can &apos;t recognize as such .
&quot; detailed maps , so @-@ called ur@@ anium datas@@ he@@ ets , were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities . &quot;
these were created according to the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Survey between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and originate from Bavaria &apos;s first survey@@ ing .
your client : Napoleon .
&quot; the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 , during the Second Coalition War with Austria . &quot;
Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops seized the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 : it was the neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey@@ ing management . &quot;
the original position paper for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is sub@@ missions , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was born 21 years after the creation of the map , thus 1877 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ aying an@@ ser@@ straße , which was first named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when the zo@@ oming there appears a small @-@ scale map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written number@@ ing fragments from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; primitive photo &quot; &quot; from which the land has been derived . &quot;
small plots there are no farmers there - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the current district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , in the area of the current district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ fte &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once again locked up people with del@@ usions . &quot;
&quot; there , in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich @-@ based circle of Munich @-@ based &quot; &quot; auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ fte &quot; &quot; was created . &quot;
&quot; in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den led the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progres@@ sively for his time and , for example , ended the chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; he also prohibited the personnel to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , director of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients it was first place , and later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ al Institute in Haar 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum Magdeburg @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been located there since 2006 . &quot;
young people meet at the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in the grounds of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments .
&quot; West is the football field of the T@@ SV Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - in an architec@@ tonic reference to the original building of the Ir@@ vine , destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Allied bom@@ b@@ ings broke many holes in the city centre . &quot;
one big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood on the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 , the ground breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn race track . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
citizen rights group published travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Mis@@ sour@@ i State , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ani@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur throughout the state and be noted here , &quot; &quot; says the group . &quot;
&quot; the recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people more difficult to win discrimination , as well as enforcement agencies of the state , which are dispro@@ portion@@ ately aimed at minorities , prompted the group to release the warning message , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
they have bre@@ aches of civil rights that people happen .
&quot; they will stop because of their skin color , they are crushed or killed , &quot; &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol during the journey and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points out a recent report of the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i Office , in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will be hal@@ ted more frequently than wh@@ ites in the state . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready to bring cash or know relatives that they travel through the state .
&quot; in 2015 , Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the Al @-@ hate crime report of the FBI , which ranks the state with respect to the number of such violations on the 16th place of the country . &quot;
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states endor@@ sed Immig@@ ration Law@@ s to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is spontaneous
the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ de@@ zau@@ n Project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U Bundestag members Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac acquired a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the court @-@ court of the family Schwen@@ de@@ mann , representatives of the CD@@ U @-@ town association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially granted insights into his operation , in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , provided 40 cows and also many k@@ itt@@ ens and accommod@@ ated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Black Forest &apos;s milk &quot; is for him an alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
there is only regional at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; as he is also BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he called the electric fence project as &quot; elementary important . &quot; &quot;
I cannot produce profit@@ ably on such steep areas .
&quot; the green area care for a lot of work , much needed to be processed with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and cultivated them without chemical crop protection and fertili@@ zers , even if he does not lead a bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is pleased with the leaders . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3,000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the surfaces could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they will continue their business , &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion .
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 pitches of eleven participants were f@@ enced in over the electric fence . &quot;
&quot; the conservation area is therefore 40 hectares , which must not be explored until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; of the total costs amoun@@ ting to EUR 71 500 , half has been promoted to leader , a quarter bearing the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmers continued to stay 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; declared Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and ma@@ ids it does not work . &quot;
also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; best foods are produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ schaft@@ Care Poli@@ cies ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state support of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the goal is the holding of the Black Forest .
the presence of a subsi@@ dy caused by L@@ PR is essential .
&quot; in addition , the f@@ encing area must not be economical ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ fence project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build a fence around 16 kilometers . &quot;
&quot; the conservation area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing sacred ?
the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated controversy with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the President to dras@@ tically restrict legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty @-@ owners would have g@@ yn@@ ned him if he had done it .
&quot; but it took its meaning and , in particular , the meaning it was attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , which was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem in which you relate which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about contemporary resonance on the stir@@ ring words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immig@@ rant , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your arms , / your oppressed masses , which y@@ earn to breathe freely , / the el@@ usive drop of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; smiling garbage &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict on the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict : it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took a very political action .
&quot; the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism , portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a classical figur@@ ative depic@@ tion . &quot;
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a dis@@ astro@@ us attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Laz@@ arus had changed the significance of the statue , people wanted to switch back from the right wing for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty had no one , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives that brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady liberty is progres@@ sing . &quot;
it is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States .
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is entirely a matter of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible travels on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome which they need to hear .
and that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge .
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred , which is their only source of power , ign@@ ites . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ dges Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Scot@@ ts belonged to the UK team
&quot; the Director General of the Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ headed Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship cad@@ ader will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 scheduled on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; Scotland is developing something special , &quot; and the United Kingdom &apos;s Athle@@ tics must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish ath@@ lets think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the corner of the street .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir F. Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m route while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain by the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot;
&quot; their talk was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver med@@ alist , who is competing in their fifth world champ@@ ionships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 bul@@ k@@ heads are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this route and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which one should watch for a great season , which included victory in the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ yle re@@ members their first world champ@@ ionships , when the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell was . &quot;
&quot; the team captain said that they are &quot; &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men belong not only to the team , but in some cases also be involved in medals and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots , which belong to the team . &quot;
it just shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there .
block critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the entry of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the papers beat him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he kno@@ cked at the cri@@ tique , certainly . &quot;
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union was compl@@ aining about it early this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a repub@@ lican governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular . &quot;
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary he@@ at@@ head .
he has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very ade@@ pt at using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to book his ha@@ ar@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore the blocking of persons coming to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is designated as official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ yer spokes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argued that blocking of comments is nothing but a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ay @-@ filled people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post also talked to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not mund@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not bot@@ tled , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news report &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are desp@@ ised by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff described as &quot; concentrated spam &quot; would probably call &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot;
the Facebook @-@ era makes it easy to make a message by simply blocking a critic or being deleted a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , when one would have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorial notes and to arrest or arrest demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but that is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official who critici@@ zes Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County , injured the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to US District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U due to his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable por@@ e had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter @-@ schrei@@ ber struck down his guidance . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; the peti@@ tions , which critic@@ ised the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med its office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not sil@@ enced them .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who passed the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round last year before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the association founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
J@@ erry made a great job when he set this place .
he is an ard@@ ent advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the home based in South@@ port . &quot;
I have not been able to defend the Extrem@@ ad@@ ura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I &apos;ve won it .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on home floor . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid gul@@ f .
I am happy about how it has been done .
&quot; the trio on the field is the former master winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and senior major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup @-@ captain Sam Tor@@ rance are among the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer during the past two decades .
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; said Head of Master Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; reasonably well in time &quot; , &quot; said the director of the farm Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is much hiding in the ground , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
the traffic that hin@@ ders the construction work again and again represents a major problem for the Bau@@ tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the ignorance of drivers against red lights and barriers is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p Company have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were very exhau@@ sting .
&quot; but fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; said Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ency in the rest@@ less Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife normally places a sweet potato - locally known as not@@ a - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour the char@@ red tu@@ ber is picked up with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lows up . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. wash clothes with mud@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a roof@@ ed room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned to fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late to work is dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , swi@@ f@@ tly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and ex@@ cludes foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was formally divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covered the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is o@@ ily . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with car .
there is no public transport system .
&quot; the town of about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrug@@ ated board roofs , which have been converted into different yel@@ low@@ ish @-@ brown tones by r@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indonesian have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans learned a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we weren &apos;t used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright red skirt . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix lies only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort generated gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua &apos;s resource assets valued 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a sti@@ fl@@ ing presence . &quot;
&quot; an inquiry from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ anian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal high@@ land in the 1970 @-@ s have been committed to the genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; in a report from the arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ bane from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are contained , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing since Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ anese war@@ ping cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people are fighting to keep up with it .
&quot; the migrants have started selling chick@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year old Pan@@ i@@ ai native native to the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has ta@@ sted the native Papua , the Mama @-@ m@@ um &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmermann secured 27 out of 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai was only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them they should turn their head@@ lights on .
&quot; one of the soldiers fired an attack on her tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and struck the group with their rif@@ le pist@@ ons , said the victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten to fall into coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day . &quot;
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice . &quot;
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting @-@ bows and performed the orph@@ an@@ age dance - continuously and a bird song in the circle - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ trunk .
some prot@@ esters began to throw stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent an instruction on an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official TIME document that has not been released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ama , 56 , head of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TIME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ama still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who is wearing a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I knew him .
&quot; the chief spec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the speaker of the Papua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more wounded . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came filtered on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ uses in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and in the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be tra@@ vers@@ ed , &quot; he said . &quot;
then Wir@@ anto did a retreat when he spoke with TIME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Tar@@ anto , accused by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; who demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t independence in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua have already been included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were opposed to such claims with fierce un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus reas@@ oned that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police arrived on vill@@ agers in the town of Pan@@ i@@ ai near Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was caught in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing alarm committees .
but locals say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded were delivered here quickly , like TIME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest for Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al living in the green Hochland of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of Papua by increasing spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested in the past years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
people here building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the hub of Nab@@ ire . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region generally go to the better educated and weal@@ th@@ ier migrants .
they rarely have capital or necessary skills to compete with their own companies .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , president of Pan@@ i@@ ai &apos;s tribal Council . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were ported for lack of co @-@ ordination with related institutions from Papua , although their rare permission was given to film . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign were to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s rest@@ less provinces of Papua and western pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six paci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting but wants to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua states that they will probably not vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai gun victims led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ pse of an victim was buried on an area just opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they may never give them justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus on his head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrap@@ ers from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire occurred on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents to escape from the 3@@ 37 metre high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which takes place in just two years by the high @-@ rise building , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and at the cri@@ es of the people .
&quot; we dropped down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident who attacked his name as George attacked Reuters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said the fire fighting units against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled the building .
the government said it is working on providing accommodation for those affected .
&quot; the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in the outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world . &quot;
&quot; a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage caused by facing , outer covering for decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London &apos;s Gren@@ fell @-@ Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , with about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) will be pleased with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Meeting .
&quot; at the session in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport was to play Davis Cup only on two winning figures , but is not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; these often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ set classics are thus preserved to the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of member countries voted for reform , the goal of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was only missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; not only for the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal had already come before the proposal to leave the final at a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : in future , the fin@@ alists will have the host right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next year in the first round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs of the Organ@@ izer , the requirements in terms of training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers are bringing prohibited objects to the aircraft , find out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among air passengers concluded that more than 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited objects are sm@@ ug@@ gled at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally b@@ illed forbidden knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed that they were late re@@ discovered that they were mistakenly fed with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey of more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers tend to ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the most common items , which were deliberately gone by T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the company said it inter@@ viewed people across the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers had brought sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers through airport security and how many would have done it inten@@ tionally .
&quot; it is no surprise that the people who are most likely sm@@ ug@@ gled , know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry the safety of those who are most frequent . &quot;
&quot; the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uncertain what fluids can take them with or how much of them .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids seized by T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancelled orders
Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is fond of the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far denied that a part of the customer has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures on sales increase and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k will be able to betra@@ y another , less mir@@ acul@@ ous figure when the latest quar@@ terly report will be announced : that of the cancell@@ ations made at the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery has just started . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k now adm@@ its : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 reservations , 6@@ 3,000 had already been with@@ drawn . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that this is only non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; for cancell@@ ations , Tes@@ la pays € 1000 ( in the US 1000 USD and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation Steel &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at present 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations suggest that Mus@@ k included in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of approximately twelve percent of all orders will be solved until now . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models should be combined - 500,000 , by 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new , never tested production streets without major disrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if there is greater delays , then the binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from getting away in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA Chief P@@ ru@@ itt reti@@ res due to the hes@@ itation of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after he had been su@@ ed by 15 states Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Authority , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce the emissions of smoke @-@ causing pollut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented change when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities more responsi@@ bly than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous place in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is about a period that went off on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for O@@ zone .
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt reported in June that he would delay compliance with one year , in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of tough@@ er environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations which resist the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden change of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the cancellation of regular roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA Administrator had passed its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement issued on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of EPA to co @-@ operate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines for implementation , and then to be charged , by activ@@ ating groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained to the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation through court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and the authority that gives us serious .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA comments that P@@ ru@@ itt at some point will use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive account of o@@ zone rules .
a draft approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made to vote in the Senate .
&quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States who had su@@ ed the EPA in this week , said the group intends to maintain legal pressure . &quot;

tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , was invited to a seren@@ ade at 4.@@ 30 p.m. &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors from the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village has made the friends and promot@@ ers of tum@@ ours to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini empha@@ sizes : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Standard . Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain to his brother Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
&quot; the wor@@ ding of the document stood on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church , also a beautiful courtyard , to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf that is still visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the glorious village centre of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 are under@@ lining these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval ap@@ titude .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church , furnished and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot;
this was accompanied by the right to insert a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
three alt@@ ars existed in the church and two bells on the tower .
the elder of the two mel@@ ted on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang in 16@@ 92 for the first time , but had to be handed over in 1942 during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bel@@ fry were stolen . &quot;
the roof was le@@ aky .
17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church @-@ chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
rem@@ n@@ ants of the church threatened 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius ch@@ urch@@ yard also served as the last resting place for the dead from hear@@ ers . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ary church was dem@@ ol@@ ished .
only the bell tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 a storm cl@@ ashed the church tower and half r@@ ushed .
&quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was dem@@ ol@@ ished . &quot;
only the tower @-@ tower existing today remained as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the &quot; &quot; creative reti@@ re@@ es &quot; &quot; as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius facility . &quot;
&quot; the organisers invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ my on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with contributions from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
author Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is at 3 : 30 p.m .
&quot; at the end of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organisers offer fantastic views . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organisers hope to support many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is of importance for tum@@ ours and audi@@ tori@@ ums . &quot;
friends and supporters of Tum@@ bl@@ ingen feel particularly committed to the care of home care such as the Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to permit clearance of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim is resist@@ ing &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
&quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) asks the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim , &quot; to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 in Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the point in Vier@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; such zones are intended to prevent &quot; &quot; as@@ par@@ ting &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; the city Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but it did not appro@@ ve the district government Düsseldorf , because of a lack of form . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval procedure is still illegal and therefore also to be taken back , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
current state of affairs : the city council once again decided to have a draft of the Wind Con@@ centr@@ ation Zone in Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette before the summer break ; a permission from the district government is still pending .
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; in this place , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is excluded as planned . &quot;
the circle confirms receipt of the request .
&quot; the relevant letters have been received since last week in Vier@@ sen , &quot; a spokes@@ man said . &quot;
the circle takes her to examine the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday didn &apos;t want to express their contents on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW RE , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer close to the construction of four 200 metre high wind turbines . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are grounds . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be met - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households . &quot;
firm of the Year for Distribution and Fran@@ ch@@ ising Os@@ borne Cl@@ arke
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch Wind@@ park near Aachen and a participation in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded in the process .
two other persons were easily injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; after police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch traveled with her car as a companion to the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother . &quot;
city and dealer planning &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ berg and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the business association and municipal authorities want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the residents to the shopping stroll into the city centre .
&quot; as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; weekend is meant to sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are supposed to invite the city to &quot; &quot; midnight &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action aims not only on the inhabitants of the city and the nearby region . &quot;
&quot; preparation are commerci@@ als on radio , an internet video and printed bags that point out on the action weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
the municipal administration and the commercial association are co@@ operating with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; this means that the trade association and the city go into a further stage of the project &quot; &quot; Attrac@@ tive inner city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; Active day &quot; to the well @-@ held Sunday , sal@@ es@@ et Sunday , conversations with all tra@@ des@@ people and hosts in order to actively participate in active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver to park fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potenti@@ als should be re @-@ opened again or again . &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also lost the city centre while shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ve the city - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which was partly broad@@ cast@@ ed , had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen announced that the third &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; Day , Germany &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , will take part in five Thur@@ ing@@ ia cities for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should promote the appreciation of local commerce and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her behaviour directly with his purchase behaviour .

tran@@ scri@@ ptions of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leader of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump asked in a telephone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president att@@ ested him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scri@@ ptions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also released and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; mies &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; is and that the existence on the trade delivered by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; &quot; de@@ pot &quot; &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the US . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massac@@ res : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 rally Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators at Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and went to the Ford Bridge from Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man - took a long train at his cig@@ ar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
&quot; inside , the in@@ mates floating in fear . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; Schrei@@ e tore the silence , when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene , played on 22 July , is just one night . &quot;
&quot; but if a loop is thrown around the throat of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience cast a very real si@@ gh . &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists joined the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post . &quot;
&quot; it is a stain on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
bro@@ o@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of State Georgia and a life @-@ long civil law .
&quot; for him , demand serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a court physician places a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI files , which were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were suspected of Mon@@ roe and the surrounding gra@@ ff@@ iti in the ly@@ n@@ ching process . &quot;
but no one was ever indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the open for decades , civil rights announcements that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time to vote in the summer election campaign in summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the FBI the black Far@@ mer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester fell asleep with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby , which she wore , was not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison as the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they got closer to the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes the FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and covered the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more conc@@ isely .
&quot; it was an election law massacre , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you let yourself register and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their depic@@ tion is clear , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with the u@@ gl@@ iness in us all , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done through .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors were crowded - a dozen white ones and the rest of black - in a room and listening to a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story alive , because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Rass@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , tried their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the ne@@ sts cri@@ es and p@@ ushes him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; he , w@@ aving away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
An@@ cona re@@ acts fire .
there is a pause .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ hid . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still gig@@ gling . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think that white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; one of the other black protagon@@ ists wit@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is engaged in getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when An@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition continues to be violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a g@@ rief , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie holidays mour@@ ning praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
&quot; about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers caught sweat and tears from their eyes . &quot;
the audience is split almost evenly between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down just the street . &quot;
&quot; they have experienced all the humidity of Georgia for nearly eight hours , when Broo@@ ks takes her on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote but now , when one stands in the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ mur@@ ders took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per one another . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , as if he wants to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wi@@ pe off their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that has played the clan member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Rass@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks together in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience sat together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
at a table a white pair of Atlanta ch@@ ats over the night with a black pair they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ sky strug@@ gled to find words that had left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do this because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching continues still , &quot; she added , &quot; today this is called only police shooting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone is holding Broo@@ ks &apos;s courtyard at his table , eating and re@@ members the civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post @-@ creation is in a certain way inspiring because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; those who do not study their own history , who don &apos;t know their own history , are condemned to repeat them . &quot;

I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in their volunte@@ ering year at several locations .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt at the furniture exchange , once a week I will help here in Gre@@ ven at the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked on the open whole day at the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ working volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
amount : I did my school leaving certificate .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broke off . &quot;
&quot; I know for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what do you do .
&quot; make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focus maybe also , really is . &quot;
and was it like that ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social system . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m going to study dual , probably make a social worker training at Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it depends always on where you are doing FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from the old people &apos;s home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
&quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot;
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the after@@ no@@ ons . &quot;
that was exactly what mat@@ ured for me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .

Pear@@ son sp@@ ends additional 3,000 jobs and cuts the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve business
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and shor@@ ten their divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched in order to overcome pressure with which the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; job reductions , managing director John Fall@@ on predominantly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May in a third cost cutting program , Pear@@ son announced plans to reduce costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which last month , expressed its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
con@@ voy of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attacks
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , Afghanistan &apos;s capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and one interpreter have been injured , an explanation of NATO . &quot;
&quot; according to local reports , three civilians died during the incident in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
NATO means that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and be treated at Bag@@ ram airport in the US military hospital .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
&quot; according to the United Nations , there was at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , suicide bom@@ b@@ ade killed at least 30 people in a chi@@ ef@@ ly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since the U.S. troops fired the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence stresses the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is weighing up the number of U.S. forces supporting military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that in Kab@@ ul the suicide attacks in Kab@@ ul also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and in particular in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule after complaints
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has rev@@ oked a decision to susp@@ end the regulation of Obama &apos;s government , according to which states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states compl@@ ained to the Agency due to the step@@ per . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive forward the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; O@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said she will show the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and from responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of EPA to assess the o@@ zone provisions - in which in a part of the country , pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured , in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with Colombia &apos;s district , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has attempted to back a broad range of environmental regulations , which the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda that , according to Tr@@ ump , is to revi@@ ve economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have spark@@ ed the set@@ back of democr@@ ats and nature conserv@@ atives who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; such as asthma . &quot;
community wants common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in case of two counter@@ votes , the Municipal Council decides to establish a joint space in the future senior citizen . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing part of the land is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it still continues until the church community has been in the community up to now , there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a common space .
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , offered to meet the assembly . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total area of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are suspended , such a common room is not intended as a meeting point only for residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ ous living , but openly in the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision taken by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn , by means of funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is located in the restructuring area .
&quot; the establishment of a joint space would be , so T@@ j@@ aden reports , with 60 per cent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed proposal to signal the investor would suggest that in this respect , it would not be possible to throw up a b@@ ill@@ age between the legs , to determine that both se@@ at@@ - and the surrounding environment - as well as the roof @-@ mounted roof - would be possible to reduce the burden and make the construction more economical - if possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addi@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; if it helps : unanim@@ ously , it happens to the body . &quot;
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings with which you are not progres@@ sing so much , but now you rest in the common room from the window , she says , &quot; I am hard doing that . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger really speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a communal participation .
it provides a conce@@ aled subsi@@ dy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface , there is no subsi@@ dy , but will be a genuine , in case of doubt , market@@ able equivalent , the opposite is the opposite . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s application to apply the proposed resolutions accordingly , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; if we summ@@ ari@@ ze the decision , we make a huge leap forward to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and severely injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police told me , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the way from Hil@@ den to Hil@@ den by 12 : 20 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driving in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder went to the road , he apparently did not heed the traffic . &quot;
he met with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .

FC Bayern Munich has to do without a Super@@ cup at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the play against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel care , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season . &quot;
seven pro@@ s are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
personnel services at the German football record champion Bavaria Munich are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ sieger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also do without the BV@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
&quot; in addition , Mr. Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has held responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , it was not good . &quot;
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights pul@@ ls the fans into its spell .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday . &quot;
in the Harz Mountains to Star walking
&quot; in the resin , the federal @-@ wide &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
&quot; this is planned by the &quot; &quot; Stern@@ warte Cross &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Stern@@ warte Cross &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; came to meet the needs of many Har@@ z@@ go@@ ers , was it . &quot;
&quot; he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to map boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and stars .
&quot; in a first phase up to 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; the question is St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on boards should be completed by internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in choosing a location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criteri@@ on .
&quot; later , the &quot; &quot; Star Path &quot; &quot; should be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars could have different colors or why a star bri@@ ghter than another , even though it is far more distant . &quot;
you can also find out which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park ranks among the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 , at the initiative of the Gran@@ t Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned Star@@ wer@@ g - the Plan@@ etary Path . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Par@@ ish ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
&quot; the stel@@ a@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to , degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to - are exactly at the distance and a scale of one to two billion . &quot;
&quot; the earth is shr@@ inking so on a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exact 75 meters distant Sun is at least 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
the total distance of the planet path amounts to a good four kilometres .
&quot; during the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to reach the junction with Plu@@ to . &quot;
&quot; as a result , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot;
&quot; the march to the next fix@@ ator , however , would last half a year . &quot;
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing contest in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the corridor to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko to the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super Spring Champion Stal@@ lion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday on Show@@ time , both comb@@ at@@ ants are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former feather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I asc@@ ended to Bron@@ x &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he has to move on light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no , no , no . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; boxing takes this fight . &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked whether it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko needs to fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also showed interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light @-@ weight title fight in the forum on September 23rd . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all the fans asked for him , &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later expressed himself openly to fight with the network , which offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he este@@ emed Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; , &quot; and he might take part in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a lot of praise for Gar@@ cia , and said that he thinks the thre@@ ef@@ old champion from River@@ side looks &quot; very slow , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show beats , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said they could sense the momentum , which arose for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; I waited for the top comb@@ at@@ ants and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injuries to the tire fl@@ yers
&quot; in an accident on the A7 , four people were injured in the afternoon on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was losing control of his vehicle shortly before the connection point of the market shortly before the connection point in the market . &quot;
&quot; the car stopped right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were badly injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then traffic could be passed along the left road along the accident scene . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; tri@@ cky Rab@@ bit works better &quot;
&quot; after the 2 : 2 towards the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping that optimi@@ zing the defense formation in Au@@ e points brings . &quot;
&quot; with the first round of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy , with the result also , wouldn &apos;t have been the two oppos@@ ers at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two counter@@ parts too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the three @-@ erk@@ ins should also be further optimized .
and a gate after a free throw don &apos;t want to capture the For@@ tun@@ ics anymore .
&quot; for the future , it will be that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will be on the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in preparation with the tri@@ ke , his team gets better than with the qu@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; still , I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; &quot; because we &apos;re in the tri@@ ke on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ess@@ el@@ mann players who can build good things , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we do better harmon@@ ize and we do not make so many mistakes in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann is going to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; whether you can speak after a draw from a bad start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a weekly season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about this .
&quot; after six to eight playing days , I decided to start the season , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be canc@@ eled pre@@ matur@@ ely because of a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit more fresh as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ladder favor@@ ites in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the interior def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland treated as an easy favorite on Sunday in the encounter at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we swe@@ ep them , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says radio , whose record is quite positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga which you have to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as boss coach . &quot;
&quot; to make such statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results published by the Swedish Federal Court of Human Rights
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities for For@@ ens@@ ische Medizin ( R@@ ät@@ ter@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish migration agency ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for mistakes in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were under age . &quot;
&quot; to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et shipped 6.@@ 8@@ 80 tests to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 48@@ 1 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judge that the person was &quot; &quot; 18 years or older &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be less than 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are steady in recent months . &quot;
&quot; we see no major difference in statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers have lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases stating that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det commissioned the 5@@ 81 results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had frank@@ ly said that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I recordings of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the end@@ ocr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work covers the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if they were going to sooner or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
evaluating the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it safe , we should not pret@@ end as if we could , &quot; he told the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult in@@ correctly is minimal . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven ton concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , director at the Department of Road Construction and Transport in the Government Pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began simultaneously on all three renov@@ ations in need between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the year is scheduled for October and is sure that the schedule is maintained .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges too , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the other two bridges are crossing the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning on Wednesday morning , the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on the northern side has a 30 @-@ meter wide and seven tons weigh@@ ty so @-@ called bridge cap . &quot;
&quot; this is a marginal fa@@ der , which is also used as an operating path . &quot;
&quot; at the southern part of the bridge , a 20 @-@ metre @-@ wide bridge cap should be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian path@@ way is to be gone .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
special finger @-@ tip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable that many companies are connected to .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for bridges between the building yard and the scrap@@ yard in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is controlled by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely closed . &quot;
the cost of the three bridges is 700@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest at German Pot@@ ato Sal@@ ad
&quot; it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to get under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the Krei@@ day Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that appeals to peac@@ efully this day as the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ro@@ del invites to the &quot; big election campaign &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D people , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally , the city @-@ picnic under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the well place , but now takes place on the parking space below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forum A World and one of the author@@ itative organizers , is really pleased : &quot; great how many people came together . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad &quot; , &quot; which also the Af@@ D could eat without problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot;
how did Af@@ D come up on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D Vol@@ can@@ ic Eifel reported that he stri@@ ves for such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking places available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ delle , Hom@@ pes , is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : at 8@@ pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz place a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D Chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; the audi@@ torium is about 200 people who wait for the top candidates for the parliamentary elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch hold their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is also short after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can rel@@ inqu@@ ish - no special incidents .
tromb@@ one meets Tr@@ ump@@ et
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli will be held in the row Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European high @-@ class orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov solo trumpet at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo voice of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both united the desire to not only cross boundaries on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Johann Sebastian Bach res@@ ists with the two as in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz editor N@@ ils W@@ ogram , combines classical , jazz and free play into an intri@@ gu@@ ing masterpiece . &quot;
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it specifically for both musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled meats and they will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart answered all openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled che@@ eses , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague , Robert Patt@@ inson , who ultimately dealt with bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette performer claims to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I remember . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I &apos;d have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten said that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I &apos;ve always lived du@@ alism and seriously believed in it . &quot;
so it has never pu@@ zz@@ led me or hin@@ dered me .
I never liked being taken seriously .
&quot; she said , &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but at school time she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , scar@@ ed and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think , &apos; Girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in particular , they don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect that you see yourself in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to have to justify myself from all the public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have gone away from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Repub@@ lican National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; &quot; the change of party by Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic party that would rather prevent us than work to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is just the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , puri@@ fying message , &quot; said the R@@ NC President R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation by the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian debt for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; world leader of Athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sport . &quot;
&quot; during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Athle@@ tics World Championships on the eve of Athle@@ tics World Championships , Russia &apos;s Athle@@ tics World Championships announced that the ban@@ ishment of his country was out of the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes who have been grab@@ bed in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence on state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to repor@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has realized within itself , that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in the next few months , we have to do everything to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete at the World Athle@@ tics Championships , which will start on Friday in London , after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the head of IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free , he said repor@@ ters in London following a presentation at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
funeral proc@@ ession for soldiers crashed in Mali
&quot; at a funeral service in the North @-@ Hessen District of Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers arrived at a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
Minister Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing in the case of an un@@ explained fall .
&quot; she described the two opposite drivers , but as &quot; benef@@ ici@@ aries of their professional . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest offering which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ hes@@ sen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the German Armed Forces in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took their leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the general inspec@@ tor Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; gri@@ eved ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defence of the Ley@@ en described the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and s@@ own . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann built the flying operation of the martial @-@ helicopter Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilot of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ achs , commander of the Reg@@ iment who owned the soldiers , said : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN Mission in Mali did not show Ley@@ en &apos;s minister : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral service , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not give any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave near his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
he shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ ag@@ us for the two .
&quot; the Queen had agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , she said further in the message . &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik was buried remains unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a feeling that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and took the title of &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ pot@@ ion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik did not receive the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the spokes@@ person of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; born in London in 1965 , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble family . &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a serious stand in the Dan@@ es during his almost 50 @-@ year reign . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented about the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk sm@@ ur@@ fs instead of k@@ nit@@ so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of social @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for confidence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
that was just two mistakes ! &quot;

&quot; five months before the official date of the country election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen set up her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in her election circle in Rot@@ enburg .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U President Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to record it . &quot;
&quot; thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; until now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag is scheduled to be scheduled on 14 January next year .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether or not it can continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , thinks it essential that the Parliament decides as soon as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on Tuesday through its further action .
the state constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament withdraw@@ s trust and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these possibilities must be legally insp@@ ected , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot;
we will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally considered reasonable .
&quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler called &quot; &quot; T@@ v@@ est &apos;s Step &quot; &quot; but somewhat curious . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called herself as a practitioner of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the rac@@ ist dep@@ u@@ ties for the return of their land of land .
&quot; we of course assume that they have given their land mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a , which she has received on the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; said the President Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; said Group president Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; we depl@@ ore the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have deliberately decided not to lead any pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot;
&quot; even in the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the aband@@ on@@ ment of the lower Saxony @-@ conservative MEPs El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Social Democrats leader on Facebook on Friday . &quot;
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare H@@ og@@ an Lov@@ ells
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; in her dec@@ aying elite and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is sc@@ andal@@ ous that the CD@@ U puts in this dirty intri@@ gue game in Lower Saxony and tries to beat political capital .
&quot; Dutch &apos;s CD@@ U president , Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler , wants to recommend his dep@@ u@@ ties to record El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; the SPD &apos;s Leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , rejected T@@ westen to counter@@ f@@ eit the outcome of the 2013 Land@@ tag election with a personal career . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the CD@@ U was the strongest force in the SPD and the Gre@@ ens , but in the country @-@ day the SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from fo@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how was the sc@@ andal going to happen ?
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the Editorial Board Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the eggs involved . &quot;
infected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food surveillance is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house was immediately un@@ locked and since the announcement of Germany &apos;s dism@@ iss@@ al in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; if the residual level of 0,@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg is exceeded with eggs , these are not traffic @-@ capable . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the companies are not to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; according to current knowledge , the production facilities do not apply immediate debt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they have to reck@@ on due to alleged illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
&quot; as always , there are too few inspec@@ tors in the serious case . &quot;
is there only a lack of staff or the conclusi@@ ve responsibility ?
there were just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; however , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; precisely for this reason , a consequ@@ ent education of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ utor in the cases where criminal off@@ ences may be present are of crucial importance . &quot;
I have already pointed out several times that I am waiting for a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to get only safe and market@@ able foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ trag@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the pan@@ de@@ mic means manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ making animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
I expect all the competent authorities to clear the facts quickly and completely .
how the Fis@@ cal Rules of Football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Parade to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organisation that over@@ sees the European game has the power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair @-@ Play rules that have been launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point , that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of tens of millions a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can safely make the money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar signs and bring him to a galax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the team through the energy rich man family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but have to counter@@ act with legitimate sources of income that enable them to break even point in their business related to football . &quot;
the FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had enormous debt in their quest for success , were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ked to ruin when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debt of clubs to the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , which originally used Roman Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch in 2003 in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ idency of the Pres@@ idency in 2015 , his successor , Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; for sure , FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the proceeds sum for the next five years will be deduc@@ ted from EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has taken the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was reduced to 20 million euros later - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to outs@@ m@@ art their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company would sponsor the PS@@ G , if the sponsor &apos;s value should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate in@@ comes . &quot;
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor &apos;s sponsor was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments to the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 argued that N@@ ey@@ mar WH@@ C will be an ambassador and simply trying to figure out such maneu@@ vers for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be more attentive , considering every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the recent published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s departure by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s final ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al @-@ manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the property and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country owns a club , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it becomes very difficult to respect financial fair@@ play because it is possible to have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss Life is looking for a new chocolate supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet co @-@ operation is at the end of a possible end : the airline will write the contract anew .
&quot; Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a report from the newspaper &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
approx . 17 million small red @-@ and @-@ white packed litho@@ graph@@ ed panels are distributed to 14 grams per ann@@ um per year before landing to passengers .
the Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the order volume according to &quot; North @-@ West Switzerland &quot; from 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs , the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates annual sales of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; as many candidates present in the new tender , the Swiss doesn &apos;t want to disclose . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y aims to renew the Treaty on Spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement . &quot;
Swiss chocolate bars distributed the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
&quot; before joining the Royal Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;
&quot; the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;

No@@ stal@@ gie goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nostal@@ g@@ ically for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ ehler and Paul Rud@@ d went to greater things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act , it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories . &quot;
&quot; but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like time is scar@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; did not work surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking c@@ anned vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle aged actors play cool children , who are grown up - they still can win the im@@ possibility of reg@@ aining the last part of the heat . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotional rooted and his par@@ ody is more based on the watering pattern , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s , such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand which the cra@@ dle is watching ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one point rum@@ bles a character by an Apple power@@ book , some inline skating and &quot; a series of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the lov@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost his vir@@ gin@@ ity .
&quot; and there is another crazy vi@@ cious plot involving Ronald Reag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt Dill@@ on &apos;s sub@@ li@@ cking band of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could wre@@ ak this fran@@ chise like a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I see as its logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; as it will see the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds us of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; in the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West Ring@@ ing @-@ I@@ con@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka as a director speci@@ fies to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ minded Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon le@@ ak are du@@ b@@ bed in English .
it is an ingen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV as Americans may do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Find out the voice . &quot; &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so deeply involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Reag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or often enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; who was reduced to a lower length , could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ eph asked again and again to visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ oured a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a for@@ age for a promise .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
impact on drugs @-@ m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police were shot against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office informed Kon@@ stanz on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , officials raised large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
at time @-@ equal hits in Italy two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two suspect Itali@@ ans .
the two are probably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were deployed . &quot;
&quot; the Maf@@ ia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crime , serious acts of violence , murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office Kon@@ stanz has been investigating the organised drug trade in the southern German area . &quot;
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was an active exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the large @-@ scale operation was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the investigations , Italian citizens were mainly related to the Italian Maf@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ indel@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
Weise compl@@ ains large gaps in the alien @-@ register
&quot; data from citizens who should not emerge : &quot; &quot; according to a report , the for@@ eigner @-@ register in Germany shows substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious mal@@ formations in asylum procedures .
&quot; the commission@@ er for the refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , report@@ edly drew attention to a media report on large gaps in the foreign country register . &quot;
&quot; in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; &quot; partly serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; could lead to defects in the data recorded there , in an analysis carried out by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to figures , ten million people with foreign nationality , including 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states , are recorded in the Register . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently cared for , the quality of data in parts has not been good . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; of people who have long ceased to live , or from citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data inputs can significantly slow down returning processes , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics of tax@@ able people , EU citizens are also registered , which would not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; such fake statements , however , led &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on dealing with tax@@ pay@@ ers , &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the German government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy under 16 year old children when they arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; it emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this paper , it is said that BA@@ MF is performing such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper with reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU @-@ State is responsible for refugees who first reach it . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant goes on to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country of entry . &quot;
&quot; the Office now writes : &quot; in the meantime , the reception capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot;
Italy has given guarantees to the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU countries would also send refugees back within the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the domestic spokes@@ person for the left @-@ wing fraction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system , and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service was already available for other people . &quot;
&quot; at least of the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ul , who has now been distributing 100 litres of blood with his 100 donations . &quot;
traditionally the municipality in the meeting of the Municipal Council acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it is awesome how our bodies are created for this and we pay respect to the don@@ ors who provide their blood for strangers , yet un@@ sel@@ fl@@ ess , &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the district prepar@@ atory manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , for the preser@@ ves are broken into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , ma@@ ize makers reported about the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in spring . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K county manager . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Bre@@ wery were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 contributions each . &quot;
&quot; half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ef@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara P@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter have cancelled ten times per 500 milli@@ liter of their juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; when they kept interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure .
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members imp@@ acted in this month as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget revenues would continue to rise by almost 3 % in autumn . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ alised that in the coming years , interest increases would be needed to cur@@ b the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
members also agreed to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut business package issued one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will demand time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial means for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , since the pressure on the real income of households continued to strain consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the rate of interest , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; something greater &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the Bank however emphas@@ ised that increases &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; would take place . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to the dollar and the euro after these messages .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; growth in the third quarter is expected to lie at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will slightly recover after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as sharp@@ ening is getting worse at first before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot &quot; &quot; prevent the in@@ comes &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; recover at the end of her three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is attribut@@ able to the weak pound , which will compens@@ ate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the fund . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for a interest rate increased since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ driven households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July called for an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected to come back in the months to come . &quot;
the Bank said that exceeding the target of 2 % was &quot; quite &quot; attribut@@ able to the weak Po@@ und .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; given the recent decline in s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again , as credi@@ tors are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages shut down , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is supposed to prescri@@ be 10,000 people con@@ ten@@ tious HIV drug &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September following a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ operative prevention pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which may l@@ essen the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the health service through a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ als confirmed last year a ruling of the Supreme Court , confir@@ ming that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a sequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduced HIV transmission for infection endangered .
taking pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such medication may be taken every day or so already two hours before intercourse .
&quot; those who come to question for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners that have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in hospitals , suitable candidates are identified to agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation at their local participating sex clinic .
the program will contract £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to deliver medicines this week following an international competitive purchase .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by gaining clinical evidence , how it is systematically used , recorded and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this big new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity .
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV @-@ risk have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we sincer@@ ely welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine has been sour@@ ced , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will help us to step closer to the termination of HIV in society . &quot;
living the great life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot of the apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add jo@@ anne storage room and an mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ lap , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor where you could stand . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively , to solve the issue . &quot;
&quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on one another , without having to bend down . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height , with a lot of additional drama . &quot;
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ ou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold design , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored at both ends to allow him to work longer .
&quot; in the kitchen , the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ r@@ ored units provide space for all the cut@@ lery and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
collap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in there , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , ven@@ e@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is opposite , so when you slide the door very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the floor area while at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give space to its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square footage of some standard into something completely amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave them . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute over one of the largest real estate @-@ empire Victori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business can be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers 38 properties have accumulated more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a store at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the family founded the West@@ co jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail outlets . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul described as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul approximately one third . &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns assets worth $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the app@@ rais@@ als proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed plac@@ ements , the Supreme Court hear@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now also struggle for control over the existing business - what Col@@ in , like Paul claimed to have excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Mon@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian inheritance dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; costs increase , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both sides held law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who bought milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen business from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to purchase the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ ons of the family .
&quot; Col@@ in says he started West@@ co when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on her property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars at leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , so Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in thought very much , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &quot; &quot; I can really not say much &quot; , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court , that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have wanted that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our issue will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
s new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the media &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece by Repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive staff on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House which he wanted to fix : bad information thrown into the president &apos;s hands . &quot;
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ umps related to television reaches decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television commerci@@ alism is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if a candidate Tr@@ ump was angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were persu@@ asi@@ ve , &quot; &quot; said the former campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; the key to keeping the s Twitter custom under control , according to six former election campaigns , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady pra@@ ises . &quot;
click &apos; Insert Before &apos; button and &apos; Publish
but the idea that &quot; s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridicul@@ ous .
perhaps these campaign officials are aware of what we do not know - that the b@@ umps twe@@ ets without their interventions would have included even more fuel .
we will probably never experience something about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his employees manage to keep him away from him a few times , their efforts have paid off . &quot;
but no one has been able to systematically prevent Tr@@ ump Con@@ tro@@ ver@@ sen .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may possibly promote their views from the world . &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very concerned with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to give the president question@@ able information for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; up @-@ to @-@ date and former dump officials say that Tr@@ ump is able to react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that it is sti@@ ff@@ ening to find out where these come from . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened at the end of February , when someone called the President vi@@ cious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; at the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson is permanently banned from t@@ witter because of chic@@ anes , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false alleg@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and started ques@@ tioning staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work and to document the dump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self and his advis@@ ors still seek influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ searched criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the people &apos;s help will be asked and hoped . &quot;
the police all over Europe sent post@@ cards to dangerous criminals this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
&quot; since the addresses of the searched s@@ words are not known naturally , references from the population will be collected and requested . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; Advent calendar in winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences had shown that many fle@@ eting on holiday destinations hide , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
&quot; since 2016 there is the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online con@@ fes@@ sions could be arrested , at least eleven of them due to evidence after publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dig@@ ging and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ aire series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some determined trav@@ eller on war feet , which have negotiated a tr@@ ench raised by the congregation to claim a field in front of their man@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the passengers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans outside a well @-@ off road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transports , after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dig@@ ger excav@@ ated by the Council , in order to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defence facilities and pressed their vehicles through a passage that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; Ramp@@ ager sh@@ ou@@ ted Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous resident said , &quot; They moved there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pedestri@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the Council has to be compelled by shame to implement it , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the passengers were there in May , were moved and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks . &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council can &apos;t even stop it .
&quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be named , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers , just to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and one has even seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; Soli@@ hull , a spokes@@ person for Soli@@ hull , said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep it as fast as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case .
Birk@@ enhof will become Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof will be the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re @-@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; due to the closure of the Birk@@ enhof hotel by the then Ambiente operating company mbH on April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and revenues were also lost by the visitor &apos;s tax . &quot;
&quot; in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered as a collection accommodation , which ensured controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
&quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the municipal council . &quot;
&quot; but especially Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location , and already spoke of serious interest in the house at that time . &quot;
he should keep right .
&quot; the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els , headed by Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has purchased the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it one of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt subject .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof has been standing in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the whole hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer talks to our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large sho@@ wer@@ able showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; real &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bathroom , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer emphas@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already conducted talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to decide precisely . &quot;
&quot; under a million euros , he counts . &quot;
&quot; the outer comple@@ xes are also brought to the fore @-@ man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is accessible by the restaurant that is open to the public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us Special Issu@@ er sets out Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; over the past few weeks , the committee has taken up the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot;
the paper marked the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensi@@ fied its investigation .
the CN@@ N radio station reported that there were already initial charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between the el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services have been accused of having shu@@ ff@@ led the Krem@@ lin in a targeted way in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there was a dispute between the P@@ umps campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; at the centre of the investigation , several men are to stand , who acted as advis@@ ers to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more thro@@ m@@ umps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; signed a few weeks ago that the special promot@@ er Tr@@ ump was personally moved to the center and investigate the accus@@ ation whether the President could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the wake of the affair . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime , and decide whether charges are to be charged . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Grand Jury are also called &quot; &quot; accus@@ ations &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in most cases , they are switched on when it is about larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the body can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge individuals under oath .
&quot; according to CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have already been issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
those who participated in the meeting were asked to make a statement and was called in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; apart from Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ ump J@@ r. were advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his former electoral campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during the conversation . &quot;
experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the suspension show that Mu@@ eller does not let itself inti@@ mid@@ ated in his work and that if it should be necessary to act quickly .
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia story is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
the subject gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
&quot; but this also usually work in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House endor@@ ses any action that ha@@ sten@@ ed the work of the special promot@@ er in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that I would not be determined against the president .
&quot; I have no reason to assume that something has changed , then the statement continued . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller was only deployed after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this ro@@ oting , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become lou@@ dly , he has hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for setting the investigations against former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the President is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; according to US media , the White House collected material against the special educ@@ ator and its employees . &quot;
the dissolved spec@@ ulation as to whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would be released .
&quot; unlike an independent special promot@@ er of the Congress , like in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired president , Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the pres@@ idency of the President of the Justice Department . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a move .
&quot; two groups of repub@@ lican and democratic sen@@ ators set bill on Thursday , after which the special promot@@ er could no longer be dismissed . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ eberg is driving in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
&quot; in the western Ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg has been replaced by the scar@@ cely seven @-@ fold Berlin of Berlin &apos;s hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e . &quot;
this divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; over a tril@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres big col@@ os@@ sus will now travel north and will probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice @-@ gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
to what extent climate change has played a role in the collapse of the Eis@@ berg is unclear after resear@@ ches .
&quot; in total , however , for about 30 years a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions of c@@ ud@@ dly loops in the region , the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) writes in a fac@@ et background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
the frac@@ ture that has now broken down has been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf so far .
ice shelf flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and inter@@ rup@@ ts regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
&quot; to the north of this shelf , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions was disturbed some years ago . &quot;
A@@ WI scientist Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete ice shelf there .
&quot; there is a lot to argue that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf is in danger , as the front edge has never with@@ drawn as far as it is at present . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can dis@@ integrate if a piece is breaking at a key point . &quot;
melting of ice @-@ ice and ic@@ eberg does not increase sea level since they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the ice cream leads to the fact that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow more quickly than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly raise the sea level , but only in a low degree , the British research project to observe the Ant@@ arc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf is the fourth @-@ largest hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and no direct connection to climate change is conscious , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most far@@ th@@ est retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists argued whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf will grow again or go back in the long term , and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these explor@@ ers do not lead to the collapse of this gigantic ic@@ eberg on climate change , in recent decades many c@@ ud@@ dly hoo@@ ves of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula are dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
this long zip of Ant@@ arc@@ tica stretches in the direction of South America .
&quot; according to the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey &apos;s research programme , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the increase in temperature increased .
&quot; the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has heated up around three degrees over the past 50 years , thus contributing to the areas in which the temperature is fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to appeal to Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U asks to leave the employer association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the Circle Day has linked 41 new positions in administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and function@@ aries work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 tra@@ inees have their first working day . &quot;
the apprentic@@ es@@ hips in the circle are obviously very sought after .
around 620 applications were to be found for the places to be awarded this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still lacking in staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are 50 un@@ occupied places in M@@ ett@@ mann County . &quot;
&quot; among other things , physicians and engineers as well as the forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG to take the initiative and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the desire of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented candidate shortage . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself extern@@ ally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include an education offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has it to do with personnel problems that you previously didn &apos;t know before .
other cities recru@@ it good officials and employees and provide more attractive conditions .
the speech is from a regular &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the ministry of illness or age @-@ related . &quot;
&quot; so high time to act , so that no more places will remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint request with his party . &quot;
he long ago made a surprise in the chal@@ k for a big surprise when he publicly challenged the personnel costs and stun@@ ned the rest of the parties .
&quot; people want all possibilities to be checked , which permit a withdrawal from the local employers association . &quot;
&quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the district administration should aim with the unions - perhaps also in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f , &quot; &quot; peoples . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for public service . &quot;
&quot; sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money can only occur if one changes into a higher level that is oriented towards career years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees were concerned about the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act . &quot;
&quot; last but not least due to the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy ag@@ grav@@ ates the tone to NGO @-@ migrants lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this if they do not abide by new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Minister Minister Marco Minn@@ iti , in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis alert came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German charity organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team had effectively collabor@@ ated with human tra@@ ff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which has been in operation for only one year , refused to express themselves to detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor am@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we are not able to operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; the organization said in a statement on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only evaluate all accus@@ ations raised at the moment , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that its crew takes infl@@ atable boat migrants aboard , which can be delivered directly by men &apos;s traders , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can shut down so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting was allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the act of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of over@@ stepping on the authority of the Italian coast guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta have , above all , an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the Code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not have &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , Nobel Lau@@ re@@ ate Organisation ( MS@@ F ) is the Nobel Prize winner . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
Ascen@@ sions and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and sights . &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome bonus .
the first tour took place in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream planes . &quot;
&quot; in between there were long asc@@ ents again and again , for the long tri@@ als rewarded . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; once again , a v@@ antage point at the look@@ out point , linked by &quot; flying &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced . &quot;
&quot; caves , cliffs , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges provided welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers at@@ mos@@ hed in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium healing sole .
also Neustadt has been controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had known the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - spor@@ tily and cul@@ turally - . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for E @-@ Sport
&quot; in the future , the sport stars are sitting in front of computer consoles , instead of being swe@@ ating through the stadium racing during wind and weather ? &quot;
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high charges . &quot;
they have also recognised the first Bundes@@ liga ( Bundes@@ liga ) that are increasingly involved in this area .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later FC Schal@@ ke 04 and the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 in mid @-@ July . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire all new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;

&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organis@@ es the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified . &quot;

* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than only once a year to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA are fo@@ stered at the competition level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sport , they have long since established li@@ lies in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme . &quot;
but is it a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is surely getting used to getting used to . &quot;
also Ingo F@@ rob@@ ber has been dealing with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses , which can be found in classic sports such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick responsi@@ veness are needed . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also exercise their body and watch the diet . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ itt@@ est player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; D@@ oping is more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult for online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport l@@ acked . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; players are on the way internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers . &quot;
a study by the management consultancy Dol@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) anticip@@ ates rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
&quot; this means that 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany in 2016 , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , the turnover is expected to exceed 130 million . &quot;

&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the soccer league clubs , according to Dut@@ t , are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;

&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market . &quot;

&quot; Carter Carter , because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy pushing for suicide , convic@@ ted &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend through lyrics and calls for suicide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years were suspended on prob@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Carter was convic@@ ted of Conrad Roy guilty of neg@@ ligent murder in June , which took his life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter faced tears in her eyes , folded hands and down@@ ward eyes , when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have revers@@ ed Conrad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no regre@@ ts shown . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance &quot; &quot; that she completely regre@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that her &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; or even her mental illness would have a significant impact on her actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosec@@ utor was reading a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that &quot; &quot; there is no day in which I do not feel the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will carry for eternity with us to be there for his sisters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy said she was &quot; &quot; tr@@ acked &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer having this one person , with whom I was together every day since my birth , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , stab yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn off the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered her to benefit from the case by any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; the few who defended Carter belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British ro@@ ommate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not in prison . &quot;
Joshua Chi@@ eck : learning from the new mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua Chi@@ ck was allowed to run as a ski@@ pper at the Audi Cup is not acci@@ dental .
the FC Bayern accor@@ ds to the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation is not hur@@ ting there .
&quot; anything was different in his place in the cabin , that Joshua felt immediately Kim@@ myself , even though the additional garment was very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup of course no Philipp L@@ ahm , and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to see , he made the rush of Bin@@ ding to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach did not tell it , &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner told afterwards , after his first deployment as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot;
good that could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could interpret Kim@@ myself as well .
&quot; not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a player in the C @-@ El@@ f , which had been chosen from youth players , but@@ chers and just out of holidays , but he . &quot;
&quot; sugar is usually distributed to those of whom you trust a lot , which you want to keep in a good mood . &quot;
&quot; those who were chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ame , can only use a little extra motivation . &quot;
Kim@@ mir confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility .
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old acted as a mini @-@ l@@ ame over the field . &quot;
&quot; right behind , this is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and in general Kim@@ mich took part in this start@@ page , like the one who can take the helm out of his hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave orders , tried to direct the un@@ heard tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had the view to the whole , while many others were occupied with himself . &quot;
&quot; ret@@ old so to re@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ dable hard ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on Teufel , to get out of the achievements of the Asia journey ( fol@@ dable only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le do not neg@@ atively fall in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ tri@@ cot . &quot;
at least that worked quite well .
&quot; Sü@@ le ran along to Kim@@ mich , Rud@@ y in front of the defence , both ag@@ itated sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ sto@@ cked Nap@@ oli storm is often difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ le successfully tried to win a couple of times in the game . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y said that &quot; &quot; the result &quot; &quot; was not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a good performance in his debut .
&quot; shift _ j@@ is ( Japanese , Win / Mac ) iso @-@ 2022 @-@ j@@ p ( Japanese , email ) &quot;
&quot; as usual , this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in the connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Rud@@ y did not have one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ mir adopted a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements on the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting proposition : &quot; &quot; what is going on here I have noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new . &quot;

&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still was Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ ser ( F@@ DP ) is in office .

&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ser attacks the wishes of the economy which Lem@@ ke has blocked all . &quot;
the largest turn@@ around sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the bridge of highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the ministry hopes for a planning procedure until 2021 will be the building law . &quot;
&quot; a role in the country &apos;s plans also plays the western walk in Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Rail@@ ways Plan . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minister of Ministers , Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; of course , nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post to support regional but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims , as inspired by Wis@@ ser , in the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports sag@@ ging for 10 years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ ser has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; there is a premium of 1,000 euros for the passed master exam and 2500 euros if graduates are independent within ten years of master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is quick to provide facts , at the same time the country is missing on the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , Managing Director of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , who want to hire bis@@ cuits at Landes@@ betrieb 40 , have only 29 vac@@ ancies until now . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president Christian Bald@@ auf refers to calculations by the Court of Cyprus , the country investing more than 20 million euros less than suggested in the receipt of country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;

&quot; Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction &quot;
&quot; one day before Audi announced that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chairman said that &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; he referred to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - prohi@@ bit@@ ing or restri@@ c@@ ting diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described enterprises as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with regulations for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting diesel engines , are regarded as carcin@@ ogens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of car manufacturers to install systems for neutr@@ alising the exhaust gases generated by diesel vehicles , also take what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of indul@@ ging the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
&quot; companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called abra@@ sive devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with regulations when a car was tested , but driving back to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees of Volkswagen have been indic@@ ted , others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Germany &apos;s engine development in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system in order to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States was expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer bears a dispro@@ portion@@ ately high proportion to Volkswagen &apos;s earnings .

Mor@@ dil@@ los no@@ oses and laugh@@ ing against suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on@@ ists , the ni@@ v@@ n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still working on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : &quot; &quot; laugh , &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
&quot; Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 , as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires . &quot;
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he was among other things a drawer for bl@@ iss cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; &quot; Paris Match &quot; &quot; and then also in the &quot; &quot; Stern &quot; &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures are in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own specifications , he still sits at the drawing table , works nearly ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; over cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his dro@@ ll figures still find a lot of spreading worldwide . &quot;
he has been working on cartoon animation and a TV series for six years with his characters .
the protagon@@ ist in the film Cra@@ zy Island is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in his drawings - that has a jack @-@ of @-@ trades as a counter @-@ player .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which will come to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; this is why he is more focused on the TV series , which , as its original drawings , is produced by word@@ lessly . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened with climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change . &quot;
&quot; due to the conditions of dro@@ ught , the lav@@ ender is declining due to insects which are transmitted to dro@@ ught , causing scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , causing major head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence , said : &quot; lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed because the plant has suffered a lot less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its the d@@ warf g@@ aden , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and it is much on the game .
&quot; lav@@ ender oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slow@@ ing down the ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dro@@ ught . &quot;

the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce meet normally on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they have been told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the Repor@@ ter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and stomach @-@ feelings are sufficient . &quot;
&quot; there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the leader@@ board of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has taken office in December 2012 . at least 25 years since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has taken office in December 2012 , and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; the latter is the editor and inspiration of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; two repor@@ ters in the 1930s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Special Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , she only introduced two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders , which are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists are rarely put to trial . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are not comfor@@ ting , even though the terrain is even more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he just managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or more people are shot in the streets , or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums of drug @-@ kings that are bigger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute , that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke with his guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; at first there was in February the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fr@@ actions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , gang members susp@@ ects any copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper published in the same story .
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were assuming he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined Ri@@ odo@@ ce with five colleagues and sold 50 USD investments .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the paper earned a reputation for courage@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved publishing hard @-@ looking investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task that you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ vogel , who was like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
now ask them : was his love for routine destruction ?
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her work best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home run@@ ways and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing is done with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , no mobile phones were allowed . days before it became known that spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the Ri@@ odo@@ ce offices in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class neighbourhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked themselves if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers , whom the governor himself was not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the repor@@ ters went into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has printed three major stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state spending concentrated on the home city of the Gover@@ nor .
&quot; and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or what happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which reigned almost the whole century all political levels . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors have been indic@@ ted for high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this loc@@ ale , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez had considered the most informative source of ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was devoted to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , which prot@@ ested against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the staff had become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
repor@@ ter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez s@@ nat@@ ched a few signs and the next morning he went to a demonstration because of another journalist in the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is thei@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing down in organized protests &quot; SO@@ S Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and letting them kill them , because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has been asked to re @-@ divide it from the government because it is concerned that their anger has hurt their obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; in Mexico by organised crime , by participating government officials and a uniform society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs but also on orders of politicians and security forces that were stuck with organised crime under a blanket . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; media asset group has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists and officials over the past year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a det@@ err@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as card : &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones were in addition to their seg@@ reg@@ ated head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with a editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , adm@@ its that drug trafficking is troubled . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when suddenly all their phones began to sum@@ ming up . &quot;
a series of shooting fights with band riv@@ als and security forces near the beach Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
&quot; the war escal@@ ated , as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region . &quot;
&quot; from the ker@@ bs , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren he@@ ul@@ ten near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez looked at the police officers who kept guard to see if they were ready .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about closing , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; If the same day , when J@@ avier was assass@@ inated , the tra@@ inees asked me to send them to the streets . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ouflage to ev@@ ade his enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , though a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
researchers have now found that the first findings of the unbelievable rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mountain worker have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had had something of a &quot; &quot; rest@@ less past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his incredibly well preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ glut@@ ton is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ wn Funk found it in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something that was l@@ acked out of the surrounding rock at the plateau , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy ground cl@@ ump@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just fl@@ ashes a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers found that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ bled a changing tank , were probably threatened by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have allowed him to get better in his surroundings and do@@ dge his enemies , experts say what is suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now displayed in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours in revealing it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or about his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far out@@ going the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it suggests that din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution fav@@ oured the deteri@@ oration of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ady - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es must have been the Cre@@ tac@@ eous @-@ time , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was rot@@ braun .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal in indications of his life , including his con@@ served bow@@ el neck , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at this time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with sk@@ id skin but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cre@@ tac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you only have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the Cre@@ tac@@ eous time was a time when huge di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , who lived Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he founded the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the uphol@@ stered din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that rose from his shoulders .
researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater re@@ funds of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the Hau@@ tre@@ ste still cover up b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a profit in the lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales at its sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are wrapped up in a massage mask .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , kilomet@@ re @-@ long poles - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; at the Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) motorway , about 20 people were injured at a mass ar@@ bol@@ ism at the late Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first statements of the police were between 5 p.m. and between the outlets Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm barely 30 cars , including probably trucks , inter@@ connected . &quot;
&quot; at first , there were no indications of the exact number of the injured . &quot;
&quot; it was a matter of mild to moderate injuries , a police spokes@@ man said . &quot;
a large number of emergency vehicles were charged at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich an approximately ten kilometres long way back was formed .
&quot; as a AZ repor@@ ter reports , it also came on the counter @-@ run@@ way to massive disability through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire brig@@ ade noted the number of car badges , which now have to be counted with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident took place on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing is stuck in the train and sleeps .
or you are en@@ gros@@ sed in his work and just has an ingen@@ ious thought .
and then : buff@@ f .
comes the conductor and awak@@ ens an uns@@ hi@@ ft or takes the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
card@@ holder control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently test@@ es the easy @-@ to @-@ manage ticket control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you have taken up your seat and thus de@@ valu@@ ates the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test operation is running on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , it will probably be available on many other long @-@ distance routes in Germany , &quot; a railway spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; is the train ticket de@@ valuation with no she@@ ep@@ skin . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use this , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have an online ticket booked - which already do most passengers .
&quot; it is also necessary to have purchased it via the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works : one climbs into the train , calls out his ticket under &quot; My tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , a button for the electronic de@@ valuation will appear . &quot;
the train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and occupied the reserved seat Y .
&quot; when the train att@@ endant comes to rank Y at the ticket inspection , he knows that a passenger is sitting there with already purchased online ticket . &quot;
&quot; you can therefore continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn intends to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to travel relaxed without ticket inspec@@ tions through our train accompan@@ iment crew , simply check out in the DB Navigator . &quot;
&quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Vice President of DB Cor@@ respon@@ dence . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who often take the train , know that besides delays and missed trains , the ticket inspec@@ tions are one of the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; because often you have , in any case , one of the fellow passengers does not have all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to show .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train guides and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in controlling their own tickets and takes the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
more access numbers on the same track are not yet available .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to her core . &quot;
only one day after arriving in New York City sat in St. Louis XVI at the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; confused , since nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ we@@ eted on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the r@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was killed by Michael Brown , an un@@ armed Black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , to twe@@ et live . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretching out on the street and staying there four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she left her mobile phone to return to Twe@@ ets later in the evening via people on Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people crying out , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who had a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; she watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman told his rif@@ le and cried out , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell said to her statement . &quot;
this is not the type of murder that we have used to and which we can typically call .
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was mad and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 11 o &apos;clock , she picked up her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th century . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance origin@@ ating from the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand responses . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who carried a cau@@ lif@@ lower and a fitting crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
&quot; I could not take them with me , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell said later . &quot;
what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .
&quot; it must know it , and see it and be enligh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she does not personally experience l@@ atin racism , she is not different from the next black women child . &quot;
I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it .
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined with a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
&quot; they prepared bags before and helped , to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; slowly , a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell . &quot;
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the minority student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; one question came Fer@@ rell in mind : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism has been nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on were not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt mates . &quot;
&quot; his commitment gave birth to the project , along with six other natives followed the team of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; during the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are portra@@ yed , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ &apos;s &apos;s experience - to show that the movement is &quot; not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ &apos;s life , as she falls in love and marry her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell said , and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be some vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ izing of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ &apos;s &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Matter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 em@@ bos@@ sed the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ oft &quot; in social media , identify itself as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is really held up by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rell has been selected as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the forefront because in a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can sense her energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news @-@ cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial relations between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Far@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she is cl@@ inging to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves people , even though it has not been built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone spl@@ its the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves any cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery tell : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi bots ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while advoc@@ ates build that a gallery will attract more customers to the city , including the rest of the business , the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the property on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketing their products offer . &quot;
with the start of the construction work will end .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - a Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with a possibility to sit outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been shopping for many years almost every week in the peasant market hall .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country@@ women are very happy again and again . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
there is also this in other cities .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall is located in the gallery , it depends on the amount of rent . &quot;
&quot; however , this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is a shopping mall in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find this superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough of them in our city .
one can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is maintained . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are rented only by bigger companies , because the hi@@ ring there are often un@@ sustainable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , there are no more special shops and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the peasant market stand during construction time ?
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit @-@ gallery really comes . &quot;
or does the G@@ AT bit Gallery manage to sell all stores from Bit@@ burg before ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , nobody needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the crazy many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer place . &quot;
&quot; when the peasant market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a fitting simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces can be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ner and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison in Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year jail sentence after she publicly announced diplomatic reports about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ emb@@ lance ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline harmon@@ ized her expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman , and pioneering dis@@ sident , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that has been extracted by Mann@@ ing , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated , as someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , though somewhat intellectual comment , not only to the form@@ ability of DNA @-@ data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted in 2013 because of 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated straight from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
&quot; the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette st@@ umps and ch@@ ew@@ ing gum , extrac@@ ting DNA from the tr@@ ash to produce an image of how these people could look . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while they were in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograp@@ hed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ n@@ ate M@@ use were to un@@ equal bri@@ bes , who exchanged several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created a comic @-@ illustrated comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future in which the President Chel@@ sailors could transform judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome kind of happy coincidence . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump is leading a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government and against trans@@ gender forces in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to solve the rigid divisions , which he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing demanded with their over@@ sized signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name is decorated with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis has been gender , race , sexu@@ ality , and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written in pencil with a jack @-@ of @-@ all @-@ trades from Cs and Gs and As . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by involving the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological sense , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring along is that our gen@@ ome will not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , esp@@ ard@@ ent memories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the comic novel mentioned above . &quot;
it shows Mann@@ ing as it emerges from the disciplinary bar@@ racks of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; when they ch@@ ew up your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so never the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets out of Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ ose when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition in person - as predicted in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ras , which coinci@@ de like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , as all in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where her genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement that also stuck behind its eman@@ cipation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
&quot; a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who were sought to suspect after a man was stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , like the acts of the Cook County Local Court . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a joint warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still dead in the place of action for dead , and det@@ ectives investigating the stit@@ ches as murder while the police are looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ them has been a professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice @-@ President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them had now been in a review and excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal responsibility investigated by the competent authorities and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a speaker at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in every conceivable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urged the susp@@ ects to address the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities will help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious hint , who said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear , whether the incident took place on July 27th . &quot;
security cameras have been confirmed that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the occup@@ ants : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will shut down the WA@@ DA timet@@ able in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian vice @-@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA timet@@ able was updated in this regard , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA timet@@ able for compliance with the Code which describes the criteria for re @-@ implementation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause anxiety for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the international sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports by the Canadian attorney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , M@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has collap@@ sed . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programmes , and we won &apos;t admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; talking to the Russian outlet r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this account un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in the course of the D@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als . &quot;
however you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) .
&quot; following a visit to the Moscow headquarters in July , WA@@ DA &apos;s CEO Olivier Nig@@ gli announced that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs more
they shared the company groups .
&quot; it is a pure precau@@ tion measure , it could be further assumed by no health impair@@ ment , it said in the message . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs could be supplied to Al@@ di , which are demonstr@@ ably tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il anti @-@ lice products . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency with his customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce startup , but the surveys did not work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people out of the outside for help .
a new Human Resources start @-@ up race is on the waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to carry out surveys , provide employees an@@ onym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ surveys and surveys of specific teams , it offers a heat map of the company , which shows at a glance which units have most dis@@ comfort and which managers have low appro@@ vals - so that you can drill why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the forefront of workplace culture , you won &apos;t have to be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken , have been punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the finance @-@ technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up convert , the company helps prevent bad behavior and recogni@@ zing , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; convert has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
it has recently been registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , converting companies can send customised &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which allows employees to report bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; and if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ gence . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that deals badly with its employees or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ ting , employee turnover and law@@ suits , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Conver@@ cent has deployed for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now that the company Conver@@ ted uses , problems formerly identified by managers who were seated in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practitioners - can be identified quicker and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who led the risk management group by Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take eth@@ ic , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service and tas@@ ked the company with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will support Venture Capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; convert $ 10 million to finance in February of companies such as S@@ apphire V@@ entures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , raising his total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing research complex that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only in@@ serts . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices heard and that the work that you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which both Conver@@ ted and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors can achieve ren@@ ders when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; when the analytics tools of third promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , this can breed disappointment and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 interviews , &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have too much left on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow employees ask , &quot; Do you really belong to me ? &quot;
do you care about this ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so salvation . &quot;
&quot; after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run this leads to a better bon@@ ding of workers in a sector known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not required to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brothers
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tain on one side of the new exercise areas of the team on campus .
some have with@@ drawn their tri@@ cot kern@@ els and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these two @-@ hour break represents a lunch break . &quot;
players who are registered to the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three hour exercise before they return to the Wasser@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 AM .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and they actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 to meet the already packed timet@@ ables of the players . &quot;
the compromise between the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins moved to the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood conducted practical exercises .
they are to keep 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supported the Ru@@ le of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if she adds another point to the player &apos;s busy routes . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they sne@@ ak on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; U@@ C@@ LA will stop its practices as soon as the camp is finished , in view of the clear line of sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ so Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already cleared a protection net behind a gate post , which will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against fake news
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and send them to fact @-@ audi@@ tors , which may display results of the fact review from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critici@@ zed as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French elec@@ tors being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to quickly eliminate h@@ opping @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany launched a test of the new facts @-@ check . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fac@@ tual review parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to be able to test his feature for the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy sitting in the Bew@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent , and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosm@@ opol@@ itan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ ary . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England spann@@ ed the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ y May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s that worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters smell of smoke , because at that time a fire kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself was there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome message &quot; ) it all seems too nice to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landsc@@ apers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust got the full access until 2006 , when the last owner , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to care about the archives , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , Let@@ ters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent who had something : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go their way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se himself in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; The ver@@ mic@@ elli Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jes@@ uit patent that the Dar@@ rell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell has staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery , which was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok to always pay debts and spend money on things they could not afford .
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men rede@@ emed their debt crises , mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adver@@ tise land@@ locked . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences &quot;
&quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a San@@ atorium in the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature again . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ n life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enkap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf veiled
&quot; with the inaugur@@ ation of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Maria chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honne@@ f opened its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; by Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team aim to keep Nelson Art@@ z &apos;s logo and slogan . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the makers of the campaign have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf chapel since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we think of this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their website that was yesterday released . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we believe that as a bad Honne@@ fer we know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; with the action , it is about more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ recur@@ ring promise , one that gives the city a unique unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , she stands in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
the town of Bad Honne@@ f is a medium five @-@ digit amount for its new umbrella brand and the campaign costs .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; each year in early August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on pen@@ sion@@ ers and promotions in the officer &apos;s cor@@ ps . &quot;
this is the same as this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the pres@@ idency of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the Prime Minister , the five Vice @-@ Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home , Justice and Foreign Affairs also participated in the consultations . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the head@@ count . &quot;
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff Serge@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan as the helm of the coup attempt . &quot;
more than 48@@ 6 people allegedly participated in the coup attempt will be negotiated in Ankara for this week .
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan was called &quot; God &apos;s gift , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really hold the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article titled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the General Staff , there are concerns for an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the abo@@ lition of the head@@ scarf ban for female soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the large @-@ scale entry in the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan ordered another 73@@ 95 coup leaders , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the actual masters of the country earlier .
three times they shared their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
&quot; following his victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed the power of the military step by step , not least on calling on the reform proposals of the European Union . &quot;
former officers confi@@ de that Erdo@@ gan is pushing forward an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly non @-@ called officer , who sought asylum after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat in fear of persecution in foreign countries , would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , NATO could not leave Nato cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the pur@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington alters the rules for Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said president Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he envis@@ ages lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter regulations for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries of Green Cards come out . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to renov@@ ate route for race car shuttle
&quot; again and again over the past few months , the future of the climb @-@ sh@@ utt@@ les had been fought - now it should be quite fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , the mar@@ o@@ ds route , on which the tourist rail@@ road runs , is to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the climb @-@ sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction work will begin in this year according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ ction the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is particularly important for tourism , &quot; declared public secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of refurb@@ ishing the route was estimated at around 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle will also be ordered to be ordered from the country in the future , will at present be defini@@ tively adjusted , &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ ing@@ ian Bahn as operators agree on the technical details already .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
&quot; thus , the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle is a popular train connection between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
&quot; in the course of a pilot operation over the past few months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation whether the distance is used by enough people to regularly order them in the future . &quot;
the track is also very b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about
&quot; just as you thought that it won &apos;t be any more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her as@@ cen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the release of his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his convic@@ tions , and select everything from the robot &apos;s eye color to the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes more troub@@ ling , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford @-@ woman look progressive . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ Pres@@ ix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ Gold Sex robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; in the mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent female features , the all@@ usions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ bing one most . &quot;
&quot; true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy used on his website with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then not have Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; it is said on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and increasing sophistic@@ ation indicate a somewhat dark@@ er and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R recognizes their increasing popularity , they remain temporarily on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what perme@@ ates out of the marginal areas may be very instruc@@ tive with regard to the spirit of time , in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who is bo@@ oming to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women . &quot;
&quot; the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the dev@@ oured body and the stu@@ ffed eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical res@@ emb@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background story , nothing indicating independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total sub@@ jug@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the 2017 of speech : ma@@ ids
m@@ umps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of the common sense of man
&quot; it has become a rush @-@ proof of the tr@@ ump era that the political divisions which have pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate , also split families in small format . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving , newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump voters . &quot;
we all said to them to burst out our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power of m@@ umps to bring families together .
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been studying with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited New York this week . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with tr@@ ump in the White House everyone who knows them , including the repub@@ lican relationship , with whom she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it is related to me in another context that this also brings significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dism@@ al effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the great possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer strike us . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today , I find myself amazed by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ical version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how to see his tax return ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild off@@ ense . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump passes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as im@@ measur@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the Car@@ ousel in Central Park , the largest of the NYC car park , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals rotate to look full of fear of their own shoulders . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are becoming old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I still haven &apos;t gone through the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the them@@ atic pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - but a large round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a curi@@ ously magical experience , as two 2 @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have rated the car@@ ousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , this week I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could get my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the review with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to slow@@ ing down what should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ting pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of the experience to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year he was brought to hospital for the treatment of s@@ lei@@ ghs , which he suffered from the prison authorities after a fall in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to the first death sentence for murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 by firing her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us asser@@ ted that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly in@@ tru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the 6 @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of whom they say it is too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
the National Criminal Inves@@ tig@@ ator said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the claim could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us risks his penalty to be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a curious egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four @-@ year @-@ old school@@ ers from F@@ arch@@ ers and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will in the future go to secondary school , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school manager Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and public representatives at the Bi@@ es@@ ental Bürger@@ haus in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 pupils of the four classes , headed by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle growing up in the chicken farm but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Lower Sch@@ ar carried a musical with the title &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Farm &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and abandoned it from his chick@@ ens . &quot;
instead of a chicken @-@ bush a small eagle came out .
&quot; but the hope of turning a chicken out of him , the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes presented three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinders were carrying around the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Eagle stands for the integration , said school manager Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ icks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wanted every four @-@ ton@@ er to feel accepted in his new school .
&quot; they followed thank@@ s@@ giving to colleagues , former school manager Michael Müller , who again and again took part in educational trips , and the parents &quot; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen @-@ time is now over , declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; she divor@@ ces her students after two years of lessons only very reluc@@ t@@ antly , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ se@@ ater . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
there was a great joy in the children .
eight first @-@ class äss@@ ler have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , the police arrested a group of illegal persons , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the State Department reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , significant fin@@ es . &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the victims need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
will diesel riders take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve emission performance of cars in emissions categories Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no . the software updates are optional .
&quot; the obligatory updates before apply only to the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fit has ordered the Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the next few months , but no exact date yet . &quot;
Daimler has told me to write every person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the framework . &quot;
how long will the retro@@ fitting be drawn altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
this hangs from the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment . &quot;
how long will the update take ?
the change@@ over itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do , driving no car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ? &quot;
the ACE stands for waiting .
&quot; presum@@ ably foreign manufacturers would consider , &quot; &quot; S@@ met@@ an@@ in &quot; . &quot; &quot;
is there a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but even in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
&quot; in rural areas , there is currently no loss of value for older diesel engines . &quot;
the ACE bre@@ ws to wait for sale .

Kennedy Awards Gala is one of Washington &apos;s most gl@@ amor@@ ous events .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump is promising to become political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets one of the cov@@ eted awards at the renowned Kennedy Center as the first r@@ apper .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the hon@@ ors . &quot;
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US president Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and join with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony . &quot;
&quot; the award winner Le@@ ar , announ@@ cing with progressive TV series , announced it already to ren@@ ounce participation at the gala . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make clear her sights . &quot;
&quot; Kennedy @-@ Zentrum , named after former president John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city liv@@ able
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written , but suitable applicants are rare . &quot;
&quot; since 31 years , W@@ acker has been a city builder . &quot;
and the work still makes him great fun as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
&quot; he tells of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it mar@@ vels that no application fulfil@@ s the requirement profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the next possible time .
so - taking into account the regular period of notice - still enough time for a training .
&quot; since Has@@ lach works for the Administr@@ ative Community as a Lower Building Law Body , the applicant must indicate appropriate degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would not be able to fill it out more , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; in more than 30 years in the office , some important projects have gathered to look back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city liv@@ able , &quot; he is sure of the building office and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , diversified projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen Park are about to be initiated . &quot;
&quot; the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium renovation is still a topic . &quot;
&quot; the last one will come to be@@ ech with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; for a city building master , there is plenty of room for manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own farm and gar@@ dener , many things can be re@@ acted quite flexibly . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what fits in when new buildings are approved , the divi@@ dend is emphasized . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is the builder , &quot; in the end everything is going on over my table . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with support and coordination , he can count on many years of work : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; even that his successor stays for a long time , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and want to stay . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you want to get Roland W@@ acker , after information from Has@@ lach , you should have graduated as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree with the subject of architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of construction and planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) stands for high and civil engineering , construction guidelines , grass affairs , administration of urban properties , urban estate with building yard and city gar@@ dener , as well as Lower Building Law Body including monuments protection . &quot;
bike on lines thrown : South @-@ way track closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail@@ road transfer in the area of Le@@ oben ( B@@ 116 ) to the leader@@ ships . &quot;
these were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night .
&quot; near the crime scene , witnesses a sco@@ oter driver and a bike rider had been observed . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a website of Lausanne , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators had brought themselves in great danger and also at risk of mig@@ rating traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the system , as well as the delay @-@ minutes and the costs for rail transport , pat@@ ron@@ age of the railway customers could also be trac@@ ed to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; overall , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the South railway line could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten persons were exter@@ min@@ ated on Friday morning , two of them concerned the long @-@ distance travel . &quot;
&quot; freight trains were not cancelled , but they had delay . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help ease IB@@ D ( Infl@@ amm@@ ation ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study maintains exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could rel@@ ieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 30@@ 0.000 in the United States , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , researchers found at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; senior researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body . &quot;
cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
&quot; if the balance tends to be too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a type of tolerance con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve immune cells in mice that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the components of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han helps to tolerate more toler@@ ant , less flamm@@ able intestinal mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system also works with people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had not been separated , this did not have . &quot;
&quot; it presum@@ ed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial cells of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
mice were wound up in a sterile environment so that they l@@ acked an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they were given to L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how bacteria were affected by the immune system , the researchers , L. reu@@ ter@@ i , left in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism which is known as in@@ i@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the mice &apos;s feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells such as mice and that most of us Prot@@ ect L. Cross in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last summer season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impres@@ sively mar@@ ched in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the blues tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho added that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later be ready .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho used his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent in this week revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had three more commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already paid a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of his four priority new obligations . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in Washington State Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. State Michigan and with@@ drew in the form of a Dream@@ liner across the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; new sur@@ charges for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , S &amp; D prime minister looked at a certain concern for Berlin before elections . &quot;
&quot; only a fire from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the Bund , was the most important wish of the elec@@ tive fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House have watched the events in the SPD @-@ controlled provincial capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not even be described in the approach with a head@@ wind . &quot;
there were failures .
and one by one .
&quot; following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal @-@ CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber on the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015
&quot; five months before the election , his red @-@ green coalition thus lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green Group CEO Michael Kell@@ ner called on the apo@@ state Lower Saxony Green MPs El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear for@@ gery of the sel@@ fish@@ ness .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen immediately needs to return her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and campaign manager of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this may not be true , &quot; an SPD elec@@ torate si@@ ghs when the new hi@@ fting message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the aband@@ on@@ ment of the green dep@@ u@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without own government majority . &quot;
it is the provisional cul@@ mination of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ er began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades settled at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
so it became - and everything was much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the w@@ ander , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te hau@@ te the party smoothly . &quot;
comrades in the weeks afterwards were pain@@ stak@@ ingly r@@ apping .
&quot; then , when they had just hat@@ ched new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next depression .
&quot; mayor Olaf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD county mayor , lost his Nim@@ bus during that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot;
and because he did everything wrong in crisis communications after that which can be done wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
date : 06 / 14 / 2009 Size :
&quot; due to the Volkswagen ab@@ at@@ ement and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister had already been critic@@ ised for a long time . &quot;
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely for this reason , Wei@@ l tried to set acc@@ ents more and more in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden comrades in the area of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they left him as they promised by Wei@@ l to stabili@@ ze the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in this process , Wei@@ l does not blame for the internal force of Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz was not at all .
&quot; at times , comrades always try to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the stub@@ born parliam@@ ent@@ arians of the West . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic , as Ms. T@@ westen places her own career in the interests of everyone else , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the Editorial Board Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ westen is not elected as a direct candidate for her person , but on the country list of the Dutch Gre@@ ens , the lower Saxon member . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD parliamentary group , lam@@ ents a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; four years ago , the voters welcome : &quot; &quot; people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who introduces the German Social Democr@@ at SPD as a top candidate to the Bundestag elections , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U dep@@ u@@ ties adul@@ ter@@ ates the election result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there are further commitments given by CD@@ U Niedersachsen .
funding for the town core III
&quot; who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years , can soon get assistance from the country . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of the city development were informed about urban development on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what is happening . &quot;
since 1991 there have been sensi@@ ti@@ zing areas of rehabilitation .
&quot; at that time , in the I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the restructuring area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the existing renovation projects are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to further develop the interior development , and not only to develop new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , I received the information from the Government Pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe that there will be a reconstruction area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount was 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the municipality felt . &quot;
how is a remedi@@ ation area now developed ?
&quot; so Sch@@ ind@@ ler continues to investigate , where the &quot; real old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role if there is interest in the planned area in general . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; on Wednesday evening , the ST@@ EC represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; &quot; Sozi@@ ale Stadt &quot; &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is revit@@ alisation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , i.e. , per plot . &quot;
the restructuring area would then finally settle as a proposition .
&quot; since 1st January 2017 , the grant period has been running until 30 April 2026 . &quot;
&quot; however , until September this year , however , it would only be undertaken to take stock , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionn@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the order decision should be carried out as far as possible , so that in the coming year can be started with the renov@@ ations . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that every municipality needed to carry out the said preliminary investigations .
&quot; it is about evaluating the urban@@ istic ab@@ norm@@ alities , and deciding when to be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent . &quot;
&quot; for the respective property , there is also a mem@@ oration note in the land register . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come to sens@@ ations again and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
a major success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; yellow Ques@@ tion@@ n@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and land rain@@ bow &quot; , &quot; in which it is among other things the structural condition and the refurb@@ ishment stages . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; house@@ - and apartment arch , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and habit@@ ants of a living room . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; operating bow &quot; &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , to be observed , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler still emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funds in the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who comes first , warns first . &quot;
&quot; one cannot reserve funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Center II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; pal@@ atable &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot;
British invent@@ or uses a micro@@ chip for himself to come into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consulting an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the promotional costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Law@@ n for an event that supplies U.S. production in the last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the information provided by the military , which were left to TIME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ re@@ piece of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was issued next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ truck from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a fork @-@ lift truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fr@@ ago , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Law@@ n , according to the records of the navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the H@@ MX @-@ 1 commander on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the deputy naval commander for aviation . &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter hit the South Law@@ n on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning and remained so long until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 was ev@@ acu@@ ated this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of hours a second team would be needed for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security guards of the unit stayed on the ground while on the ground . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by TIME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ atch Act provides federal , state owned property for political purposes . &quot;
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could harm the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a breach of the H@@ atch Pro@@ acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the command@@ ant wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot;
&quot; the event &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus to reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes . &quot;
pres@@ idents are required to use them for the journey .
but its use only for a photo surgery is unusual .
&quot; his Twitter account is full of messages , compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; - showing products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew frequently carry training flights in the Washington area and South Law@@ n to de@@ duce U.S. pres@@ idents in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
&quot; as Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted at the training needs of the flight crew for the month , an official said . &quot;
helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ pres@@ idency missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took over the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man from Sik@@ or@@ sky said the company had not been involved in setting up helicop@@ ters on the South Law@@ n .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget terms for the presidential and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
&quot; according to hourly rates by the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D refund is $ 24.@@ 380 per hour for the V@@ H @-@ 3D . &quot;
recordings of the unit record the air@@ time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D not include personnel costs but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former White House press secretary , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course it is appropriate to highlight that .
&quot; it was not clear if Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered the event of the South Law@@ n for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to the representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; this is a compact team , which is always played in quite similar formation . &quot;

how America can harm OM@@ V
&quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he took his signature under the law for the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , the congress passed a few un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the U.S. thrust . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft envis@@ ages to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors from the Austrian OM@@ V have been al@@ armed with the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea tung Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies . &quot;
the drug is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too soon for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions even by executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has seen what the Group could aver@@ t , and which could really hurt him . &quot;
&quot; Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el in the Hit@@ series of Net@@ fli@@ x &quot;
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over . &quot;
&quot; the eas@@ els three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first got their first trailer and showed the newest bu@@ sts of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of drug trade in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; only with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;

role backward : the town represents 46 cooking aids
the city re@@ organis@@ es the K@@ ita lun@@ ch@@ time .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the city &apos;s day care centres .
&quot; on 1st September , the city of Kre@@ feld is taking over the food supply in the urban child care centres ( kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant director in the field of youth welfare , this is good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the house , a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and supplies freshly cooked ch@@ illed . &quot;
&quot; the city runs 46 children &apos;s centres in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time . &quot;
&quot; in the last year of the year , 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile not only children who are cared for 45 week@@ days in the &quot; &quot; K@@ ita at noon &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 pm .
&quot; 46 Part @-@ time equi@@ val@@ ents have kitchen service starting 1st September : they warm up the delivered food , complement it with salads , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individual , give away food , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decide on the timet@@ able .
&quot; the kitchen assist@@ ants are now part of the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger involved , and it is easier for kit@@ esur@@ fing to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
because it is also about healthy eating and cooking .
children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is sensible .
even for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the ch@@ ick forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen @-@ service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , has also the charm that it has found itself in the cost comparison between self @-@ governing and foreign awar@@ ding to the city as the most economical result , it is from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are rest@@ art@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 people in the education sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative when all members of society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , Vice President of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are chann@@ eling at the council elections in the provinces . three women candidate for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble when women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process . &quot;
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; the Taliban have published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be handed over to the government peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot;
Hay@@ som said that a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of total registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ king Factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to wi@@ pe out the long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow over the long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 people work in the factory , which is next to other products plan@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea Cook@@ i@@ ries . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that workers and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; first experience &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s urged to &quot; express concern that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be advanced . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce concentr@@ ates heavily on the local community and the Glasgow wholesale area , an important pillar for decent work in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently a thri@@ ving production presence near Mc@@ Vi@@ tia . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly to it as we value the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we are active in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operative improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . if our operations are changing at the location , employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona have warned against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
La Liga page likes its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti ber@@ eu@@ en
&quot; in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not ref@@ rain from releasing an offer of £ 189 million to release its release clause , but have they warned in Barcelona three years ago ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the double of the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the previous season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about how N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way outside , although there is a spring near the Catal@@ ans board that the club has always had its best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world three years ago warned of the PS@@ G Pres@@ idents before this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club , who wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s top players . &quot;
&quot; I am not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereas the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer expresses interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s report reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse cases reli@@ eves the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussion .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ es , Spe@@ aker of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained after publication against the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur , he expect from the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 year brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would greatly serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their then false assessment of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican paper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critici@@ zed that in reporting of violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were measured with &quot; two kinds . &quot; &quot;
&quot; regarding the enc@@ ro@@ achment in Regensburg no one doubt that it is &quot; &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; &quot; that must be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk , Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said : &quot; we like to go to the church and that &apos;s a fo@@ al fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches were a very normal educational mean &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports of the abuse incidents , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who with R@@ atz@@ inger , auth@@ ored the commemor@@ ative band &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s protection , &quot; says Ez@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he analy@@ zes the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which the author commissioned by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with the clari@@ fication officer Ulrich Weber referred to ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were severely ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said to be Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by many cases Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was used to form physical and psychological violence . &quot;
especially in high emotion@@ ality the punishment for the pupils could also be more intense .
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to many other accus@@ ations , many victims over@@ looked the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even had positive memories with him in many cases . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger explains in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence &quot; at the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; firstly , many students emphasize his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became more tangible when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as its bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger always occurs in it . &quot;
&quot; there are eight pages dedicated to him , and he is clearly exposed to any suspic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot;
the violent exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school also acquired themselves outside his sphere of influence .
&quot; at best , one can repro@@ ach him , learn from it too late , or have taken the first hints not seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , on which it worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so also the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger bears a very excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who supplied the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by grapes from children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion , which sometimes led to sp@@ ells . &quot;
&quot; the fact that he did not only kn@@ it with chairs and threw the keys on the ground , but also distributed ear @-@ fig@@ s and pulled too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself regre@@ t@@ ted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that . &quot;
&quot; it must , however , be said that such educational methods were widely spread in the question@@ able time , in the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is actually in this report , namely sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , this is true Bag@@ at@@ ellen . &quot;
one wonders if it &apos;s not more to do with his popularity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media have just r@@ ushed to him .
&quot; many , who never understood him , are still working eag@@ erly on the Bavarian Pope . &quot;
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report , a lot of abuse was reported on the subject of abuse at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger have put a burden or complic@@ ity in the final report with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted to the Cathedral Master .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said one of the afflic@@ ted to the others , &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem with clari@@ fication of sexual abuse was and is nevertheless that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students share R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : an inqu@@ iring student formulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely insight and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I think it ... even for really absurd , to assume that ... &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; that the students and / or their surroundings confi@@ ded to him in the run @-@ up , could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse affects , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to speak from any fellow citizen . &quot;
&quot; in such a way , he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradic@@ ted crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , a lot of &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; was to be read by the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; Weg@@ berg &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : yes , this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge det@@ achment from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is exactly what is the abuse of the report .
&quot; in fact , it is clean separate : between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , we say again , other repro@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from the period since 1945 , i.e. also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly sh@@ ed@@ ged and severely handic@@ apped , all acquired at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to have prev@@ ailed . &quot;
&quot; but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; that was , as most of the witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject of &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; conditions .
what was different from the gym@@ nasi@@ um gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but not a sa@@ di@@ stic force . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims over@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even have positive memories with him in many cases . &quot;
at most it remains the accus@@ ation to have looked away .
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was in charge of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently closed the ears before the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , which the report was even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he pointed out this , &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool continues to practice the punishment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was needed , as test sentences were banned in Bavaria long ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , they acquired themselves in a legal grey area , as each one of us knows still . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult to estimate for him , where perhaps the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the ad@@ missible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say he has always looked away .
this is just not true .
only in 1980 the death penalty at schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is claimed yes , it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the time of that time . &quot;
how do you see it ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger to assess the past with today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess was right there .
&quot; but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times , and also not for what was served in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls . &quot;
this is all terrible and I am happy that it will finally be up .
&quot; but at the same time Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has to take shelter , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ ing ears and ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , he kept strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
what image of his Ravens@@ burger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger played with you for the talks with you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ?
was the subject of Test Pen@@ alty also available in the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , there the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were just a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not hide in any way that he led an aust@@ ere reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but this has to be said once again : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly be possible for him to form a world tran@@ g from the previously well @-@ known Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you don &apos;t even make a big singer and stand before every success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people have you experienced as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the conversations with her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through working on the book and beyond , I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced over and over again as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deeply believing and cor@@ dial good people , of whom one cannot imagine that he could only do something else . &quot;
&quot; I get regular contact with him , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , 23 years after his retirement , visit him , read him - he &apos;s almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who haven &apos;t given him up to this day , that he was once strict to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are thank@@ ful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person , to which they still look up today and which they ad@@ ore them down@@ right . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again quite clear : all that is presented to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves it . &quot;
&quot; now the insurrection would command , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany , no one would know the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally into peace . &quot;
