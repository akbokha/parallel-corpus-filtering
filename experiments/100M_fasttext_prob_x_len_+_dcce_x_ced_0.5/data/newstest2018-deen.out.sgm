<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">"an Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today."</seg>
<seg id="3">"a crypt chapel, where now it is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners cultivate the former cause of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows everybody who had to get upset because the car navigation device instead of a moving road showed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but precisely for this reason very enlightening."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork carpet that you can't recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"detailed maps, so-called uranium datasheets, were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bayerischer Survey between 1810 and 1864 and originate from Bavaria's first surveying.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800, during the Second Coalition War with Austria."</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops seized the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: it was the neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The original position paper for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is submissions, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was born 21 years after the creation of the map, thus 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along the present Playing anserstraße, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when the zooming there appears a small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbering fragments from the so-called" "primitive photo" "from which the land has been derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots there are no farmers there - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the Oktoberfest, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of the current district Au-Haidhausen, in the area of the current district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "at the Gasteig" "or from the hill" "Auf der Lüfte" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once again locked up people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there, in 1858 / 59, the Munich-based circle of Munich-based" "auf der Auer Lüfte" "was created."</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressively for his time and, for example, ended the chains of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"he also prohibited the personnel to use violence against the inmates," "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution."</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients it was first place, and later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenal Institute in Haar 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Magdeburg-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been located there since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet at the Munich Salesianum in the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "- in an architectonic reference to the original building of the Irvine, destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as" "Main Square", "the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allied bombings broke many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">One big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood on the Marienhof, where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017, the ground breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn race track."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen rights group published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Missouri State, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017 calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourianians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur throughout the state and be noted here," "says the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"the recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people more difficult to win discrimination, as well as enforcement agencies of the state, which are disproportionately aimed at minorities, prompted the group to release the warning message, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have breaches of civil rights that people happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they will stop because of their skin color, they are crushed or killed," "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents like racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol during the journey and was taken into custody by the Missouri police, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points out a recent report of the Office of the Missouri Office, in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will be halted more frequently than whites in the state."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready to bring cash or know relatives that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015, Missouri reported 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the Al-hate crime report of the FBI, which ranks the state with respect to the number of such violations on the 16th place of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states endorsed Immigration Laws to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is spontaneous</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherman Weidezaun Project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag members Peter White and Kordula Kovac acquired a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the court-court of the family Schwendemann, representatives of the CDU-town association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his operation, in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provided 40 cows and also many kittens and accommodated in five apartments Feriengäste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Black Forest's milk "is for him an alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">There is only regional at the table of the Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV-Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the electric fence project as" elementary important. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot produce profitably on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area care for a lot of work, much needed to be processed with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with topography," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental operation and cultivated them without chemical crop protection and fertilizers, even if he does not lead a bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is pleased with the leaders. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3,000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reforestation of the surfaces could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they will continue their business," "said the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 pitches of eleven participants were fenced in over the electric fence."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the conservation area is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be explored until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total costs amounting to EUR 71 500, half has been promoted to leader, a quarter bearing the municipality of Fischbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus the farmers continued to stay 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," declared Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and maids it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White stood firm: "best foods are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The LandschaftCare Policies (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state support of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the holding of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of a subsidy caused by LPR is essential.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the fencing area must not be economical (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fisherman Weifence project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build a fence around 16 kilometers."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the conservation area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">The White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated controversy with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President to drastically restrict legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty-owners would have gynned him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but it took its meaning and, in particular, the meaning it was attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, which was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to go to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem in which you relate which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrant, but the poorest of the poor:" your weary, your arms, / your oppressed masses, which yearn to breathe freely, / the elusive drop of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "smiling garbage" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict on the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took a very political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">"the sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism, portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a classical figurative depiction."</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a disastrous attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus had changed the significance of the statue, people wanted to switch back from the right wing for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty had no one, but rather an early neo-conservatives that brings the American flame into the surrounding world:" Lady liberty is progressing. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a matter of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible travels on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome which they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred, which is their only source of power, ignites."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black lodges Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scotts belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the Director General of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-headed Scottish contingent in the world championship cadader will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 scheduled on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" Scotland is developing something special, "and the United Kingdom's Athletics must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athlets think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the corner of the street.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir F. Farah on the 5,000 m route while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is quite modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"their talk was incredible," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought naturally, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medalist, who is competing in their fifth world championships at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" unbelievable "that 16 bulkheads are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir leads along this route and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman, which one should watch for a great season, which included victory in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">"Doyle remembers their first world championships, when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain said that they are" "enormously proud" "to the fact that many of their fellow countrymen belong not only to the team, but in some cases also be involved in medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots, which belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It just shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the entry of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the papers beat him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he knocked at the critique, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783 Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union was complaining about it early this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazingly popular."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very adept at using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to book his haarless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore the blocking of persons coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum, which is designated as official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hoyer spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor and argued that blocking of comments is nothing but a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hay-filled people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post also talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not mundane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not bottled, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary area of the news report "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, they are despised by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the Governor's staff described as "concentrated spam" would probably call "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook-era makes it easy to make a message by simply blocking a critic or being deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, when one would have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorial notes and to arrest or arrest demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official who criticizes Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County, injured the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of the affordable pore had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter-schreiber struck down his guidance."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"the petitions, which criticised the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Great Britain, overwhelmed its office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not silenced them.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>

<seg id="232">Fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer during the past two decades.</seg>
<seg id="233">Scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.</seg>
<seg id="234">"according to our estimates, 167 pulmonary cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year," said Head of Master Heiko Becher. "</seg>

<seg id="238">House connections prove to be very complex</seg>
<seg id="239">"the construction works in the Villinger Straße are in full swing and" "reasonably well in time", "said the director of the farm Fred Heinze."</seg>
<seg id="240">"in the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, as there is much hiding in the ground, which is not noted in the plans."</seg>
<seg id="241">The traffic that hinders the construction work again and again represents a major problem for the Bautrupp of the company Stumpp.</seg>
<seg id="242">"the ignorance of drivers against red lights and barriers is already enormous," says Heinze. "</seg>
<seg id="243">The road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for passage.</seg>

<seg id="250">"in her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife normally places a sweet potato - locally known as nota - directly in the fireplace."</seg>
<seg id="251">"after half an hour the charred tuber is picked up with zealous, unwashed hands and swallows up."</seg>
<seg id="252">"Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. wash clothes with muddy water from the nearby swamp."</seg>
<seg id="253">A bucket in a roofed room serves as a latrine.</seg>

<seg id="255">Polygamy is common here.</seg>
<seg id="256">"of course, too late to work is dangerous: most of the village men are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here."</seg>
<seg id="257">"no one dares to run around in the village after 5pm," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="258">"it is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupying forces."</seg>
<seg id="259">"an existing movement, stirred up for independence against the Dutch rule, swiftly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers."</seg>
<seg id="260">"in 2003, the province was formally divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covered the eastern part of the island."</seg>
<seg id="261">Enarotali is as remote as it is oily. the trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive with car.</seg>
<seg id="262">There is no public transport system.</seg>

<seg id="273">"in addition, Papua's resource assets valued 78 billion US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="274">"these riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua who ensure that Indonesia's powerful military has preserved a stifling presence."</seg>
<seg id="275">"an inquiry from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer."</seg>
<seg id="276">Papuanian demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="277">"more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969."</seg>
<seg id="278">Mass killings in Papuas tribal highland in the 1970-s have been committed to the genocide in accordance with the Asia-Human Rights Commission.</seg>

<seg id="281">"it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch. "</seg>
<seg id="282">The screws have increased since Papuas's resources bring a influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.</seg>

<seg id="287">"it has tasted the native Papua, the Mama-mum [the women] of Papua - their market."</seg>
<seg id="288">"the Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised the inequalities and violations of law in Papua during his election campaign in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="289">"the former Zimmermann secured 27 out of 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta."</seg>

<seg id="292">"in fact, Paniai was only two months after Jokowis inauguration in October."</seg>
<seg id="293">"on 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle."</seg>

<seg id="297">Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.</seg>
<seg id="298">"a child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten to fall into coma."</seg>
<seg id="299">"a few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day."</seg>

<seg id="304">"Yeremias Kayama, 56, head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home."</seg>
<seg id="305">Nobody was listening in the mood.</seg>
<seg id="306">"when I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house. "</seg>
<seg id="307">"Kayama still doesn't know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here."</seg>
<seg id="308">"it was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds. "</seg>
<seg id="309">"the native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, the witness of shooting."</seg>
<seg id="310">"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it," said Yohanes, who is wearing a name like many Indonesians. "</seg>
<seg id="311">I saw that he was dead... I knew him.</seg>
<seg id="312">"the chief spector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers wanted to" secure "their station because they were attacked."</seg>
<seg id="313">"we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us," "said the speaker of the Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015."</seg>
<seg id="314">"it is about life and death."</seg>
<seg id="315">"according to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more wounded."</seg>
<seg id="316">The news about the killings came filtered on the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="317">"three weeks Jokowi held a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical abuses in Papua."</seg>
<seg id="318">"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="319">"" "security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set out an extrajudicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations."</seg>
<seg id="320">But the excuses began almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="321">"most of the injuries have occurred a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="322">Some were in the 90's and in the beginning of the 2000-s.</seg>
<seg id="323">"the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations, but there are processes that must be traversed," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="324">Then Wiranto did a retreat when he spoke with TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="325">"instead, everything is regulated by law," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="326">"Taranto, accused by the UN for" crimes against humanity "who demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloodiest independence in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua have already been included, including the Paniai incident."</seg>
<seg id="327">Families of the Paniai victims were opposed to such claims with fierce unbelief.</seg>
<seg id="328">"I was interviewed four times over the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes. "</seg>
<seg id="329">"I am tired."</seg>
<seg id="330">He says he still lives in fear years later.</seg>
<seg id="331">"I'm afraid," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="332">"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."</seg>
<seg id="333">His brother Yacobus reasoned that the people in Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.</seg>
<seg id="334">He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="335">"after I had buried the corpses, the military searched for me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="336">The shootings have not ceased.</seg>
<seg id="337">On Tuesday the Indonesian police arrived on villagers in the town of Paniai near Deiyai.</seg>
<seg id="338">"during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a Baufirma who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person and 17 others were injured, including children."</seg>

<seg id="341">The police said the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing alarm committees.</seg>
<seg id="342">But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot the crowd and killed one.</seg>
<seg id="343">"we were so in panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded were delivered here quickly, like TIME. "</seg>
<seg id="344">"I hid myself two days in my house."</seg>
<seg id="345">The Deiyai Parliament has called upon to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile brigade from the area.</seg>
<seg id="346">Paniai was always an unrest for Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="347">"the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and damal living in the green Hochland of Papua."</seg>
<seg id="348">"many joined the" Free Papua movement "(OPM), the rebel army, claiming to defend the rights of Papua by increasing sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="349">"some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yuden Kogoya."</seg>
<seg id="350">"in response to this, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and arbitrarily arrested in the past years, under the pretext of" securing national sovereignty. ""</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never appear again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as" a tragic, forgotten place. ""</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="354">"the little rice, which is sold in Enarotali, is too expensive for locals."</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here building everything they eat: especially nota and fruits and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="358">They retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">"ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents)."</seg>
<seg id="360">"in the course of time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the hub of Nabire."</seg>
<seg id="361">The few jobs that exist in the region generally go to the better educated and wealthier migrants.</seg>
<seg id="362">They rarely have capital or necessary skills to compete with their own companies.</seg>
<seg id="363">"the young people are not interested in staying in the village... for here there is no jobs or money," says John Gobai, president of Paniai's tribal Council. "</seg>
<seg id="364">Isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua.</seg>
<seg id="365">"in addition, restrictions on reporting international media remain tense."</seg>
<seg id="366">"at the beginning of the year French journalists Franck Escudas and Basille Longchamp were ported for lack of co-ordination with related institutions from Papua, although their rare permission was given to film."</seg>
<seg id="367">"according to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis campaign were to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development."</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's restless provinces of Papua and western papua: visa refusal and a black list," "he said in an explanation."</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that the international pressure on Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" different and widespread injuries "in Papua including the Paniai shooting."</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically supported OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">"the spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Arrmana Nasir, rejected the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta:" in Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases. "</seg>
<seg id="373">Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.</seg>
<seg id="374">"as an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, locals broke their silence and urged him" We want freedom, "according to a source that also participated in the meeting but wants to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="375">"Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua states that they will probably not vote again for Jokowi."</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," "says Gobai, Chairman of the tribal Council."</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants that Jokowi knows that the Paniai people, except that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is in poor educational and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a" guilt "he must pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="380">"despite threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai gun victims led a last symbolic act of defiance: the corpse of an victim was buried on an area just opposite the police and the military station."</seg>
<seg id="381">"they know that they may never give them justice, but at least they will not forget their crimes."</seg>
<seg id="382">"a member of our family was killed," "says Yacobus on his head."</seg>

<seg id="421">Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk is fond of the huge number of preorders for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>

<seg id="423">"in addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales increase and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk will be able to betray another, less miraculous figure when the latest quarterly report will be announced: that of the cancellations made at the new mass market model 3."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in recent months, Musk has often had more than 500,000 reservations for the new car, whose delivery has just started."</seg>
<seg id="425">"Musk now admits: of the 518,000 reservations, 63,000 had already been withdrawn."</seg>

<seg id="441">Pruitt presented change when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities more responsibly than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous place in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is about a period that went off on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for Ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">"Pruitt reported in June that he would delay compliance with one year, in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfering in local decisions or to hinder economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">"Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump Attorney of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of tougher environmental regulations for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="446">"since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations which resist the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels."</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden change of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the cancellation of regular rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">"last month, a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA Administrator had passed its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration, oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks."</seg>
<seg id="449">"in a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its reversal in ozone standards is simply the willingness of EPA to co-operate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards."</seg>
<seg id="450">"under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation, and then to be charged, by activating groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who complained to the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, was invited to a serenade at 4.30 p.m."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors from the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village has made the friends and promoters of tumours to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer Standard. Graf Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain to his brother Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">"the wording of the document stood on the Tumlinger mountain apart from the former parish church, also a beautiful courtyard, to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf that is still visible in the village of Tumlingen, the" mountain "the third, the glorious village centre of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around the year 1600 are underlining these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval aptitude.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church, furnished and occupied with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">This was accompanied by the right to insert a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">Three altars existed in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The elder of the two melted on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang in 1692 for the first time, but had to be handed over in 1942 during the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were hammered and the belfry were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church-chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church threatened 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius churchyard also served as the last resting place for the dead from hearers."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilary church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve in 1834 a storm clashed the church tower and half rushed.</seg>
<seg id="491">"in order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-tower existing today remained as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the" "creative retirees" "as successor to Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius facility."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the organisers invite the friends and sponsors of Tummy on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Author Hartmut Romann speaks the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is at 3: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">"at the end of the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery."</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organisers offer fantastic views. "</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>

<seg id="996">"despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-doping agency (WADA) had found evidence on state-funded doping in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="997">"I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to reporters. "</seg>
<seg id="998">"the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has realized within itself, that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."</seg>
<seg id="999">"CoE said he was also" "delighted" "that Russia accepted the criteria for its re-establishment."</seg>
<seg id="1000">"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to reuse Russia again," said Coe. "</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organisation that oversees the European game has the power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair-Play rules that have been launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG has to prove at some point, that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of tens of millions a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can safely make the money loose, so that Neymar signs and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team through the energy rich man family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but have to counteract with legitimate sources of income that enable them to break even point in their business related to football."</seg>
<seg id="1129">The FFP was designed by Michel Platini following his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had enormous debt in their quest for success, were effectively cheating and risked to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of clubs to the monitoring of their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, which originally used Roman Abramovich in 2003 in Chelsea, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to a harder matter."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini has fallen from the Presidency of the Presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to be deterred by excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"for sure, FFP is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week. "</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the proceeds sum for the next five years will be deducted from EUR 44.4 million in the financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has taken the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"PSG received a fine of €60 million (at that time 82 million dollars), which was reduced to 20 million euros later - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial supervision by inflating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company would sponsor the PSG, if the sponsor's value should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate incomes."</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsor's sponsor was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments to the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 argued that Neymar WHC will be an ambassador and simply trying to figure out such maneuvers for the UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"the previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be more attentive, considering every attempt to circumvent the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">"they spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation."</seg>
<seg id="1148">The recent published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than €10 million with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.</seg>

<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members impacted in this month as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an upliftment."</seg>

<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's final verdict on interest rates, the call for a interest rate increased since inflation increased pressure on hard-driven households, with three policymakers in July called for an increase to 0.5%."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said it was expected to come back in the months to come."</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the great life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced from a big house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot of the apartment has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add joanne storage room and an mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overlap, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor where you could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">"Erfan had to think creatively, to solve the issue."</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works are quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on one another, without having to bend down."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height, with a lot of additional drama."</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window of Retouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold design, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to allow him to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is opposite, so when you slide the door very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they have managed to enlarge the floor area while at the same time use high-quality materials that give space to its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and help create an emotional bond in a home," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square footage of some standard into something completely amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, like Joanne, you could decide to leave them."</seg>

<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers 38 properties have accumulated more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a store at Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the family founded the Westco jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail outlets."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her late father, Colin - by Paul described as" main operator and the dominant personality "in the family De Lutis - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul approximately one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owns assets worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the appraisals proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed placements, the Supreme Court hearings took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers now also struggle for control over the existing business - what Colin, like Paul claimed to have excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early Monidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian inheritance dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"costs increase, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides held law firms."</seg>

<seg id="1380">"Colin thought very much, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star."</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"only Colin answered by SMS, to say" "I can really not say much", "because the case is before the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our surname through the courts," he wrote. "</seg>

<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"POLITICO reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive staff on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he wanted to fix: bad information thrown into the president's hands."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps related to television reaches decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his television commercialism is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if a candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were persuasive," "said the former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" "the key to keeping the s Twitter custom under control, according to six former election campaigns, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praises."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Click 'Insert Before' button and 'Publish</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that "s Twitter habit was ever" under control "is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials are aware of what we do not know - that the bumps tweets without their interventions would have included even more fuel.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never experience something about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his employees manage to keep him away from him a few times, their efforts have paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has been able to systematically prevent Trump Controversen.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that may possibly promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very concerned with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to give the president questionable information for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"up-to-date and former dump officials say that Trump is able to react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that it is stiffening to find out where these come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly this happened at the end of February, when someone called the President vicious a printed copy of an article by Gotnews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a pile of leaks "at the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson is permanently banned from twitter because of chicanes, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has voiced false allegations in the past and revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started questioning staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork and to document the dump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus but Trump is still his impulsive self and his advisors still seek influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1444">Birkenhof will become Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">From the former Hotel Birkenhof will be the Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be re-opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"due to the closure of the Birkenhof hotel by the then Ambiente operating company mbH on April 13, 2014, approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and revenues were also lost by the visitor's tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in autumn 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered as a collection accommodation, which ensured controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">"at that time, the decision was not undisputed in the municipal council."</seg>
<seg id="1452">"but especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location, and already spoke of serious interest in the house at that time."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"the group Luisenhotels, headed by Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it one of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>

<seg id="1460">The whole hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>

<seg id="1462">"it is actually a lovely place," says Thomas Scherer talks to our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large showerable showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to spread wide, explains Scherer further."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>

<seg id="1476">"the outer complexes are also brought to the fore-man, which is already clearly visible."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affaires: us Special Issuer sets out Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special promoter Robert Mueller is to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"over the past few weeks, the committee has taken up the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "calling on people familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper marked the step as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified its investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN radio station reported that there were already initial charges of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between the eldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services have been accused of having shuffled the Kremlin in a targeted way in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there was a dispute between the Pumps campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"at the centre of the investigation, several men are to stand, who acted as advisers to the Republicans in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also took more and more thromumps private and business environment under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "signed a few weeks ago that the special promoter Trump was personally moved to the center and investigate the accusation whether the President could possibly hinder the judiciary in the wake of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">"the main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime, and decide whether charges are to be charged."</seg>
<seg id="1490">"therefore, Grand Jury are also called" "accusations". ""</seg>
<seg id="1491">"in most cases, they are switched on when it is about larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The body can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to charge individuals under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to CNN, pre-invitations have already been issued, which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">Those who participated in the meeting were asked to make a statement and was called in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"apart from Trump Jr. also Trump Jr. were advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his former electoral campaign manager Paul Manafort during the conversation."</seg>
<seg id="1498">Experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the suspension show that Mueller does not let itself intimidated in his work and that if it should be necessary to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the collection of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia story is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The subject gives the democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but this also usually work in secret, he emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House endorses any action that hastened the work of the special promoter in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that I would not be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to assume that something has changed, then the statement continued."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only deployed after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rooting, accusations against Trump have become loudly, he has hindered the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June in front of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him for setting the investigations against former national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"according to US media, the White House collected material against the special educator and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The dissolved speculation as to whether Trump Mueller would be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent special promoter of the Congress, like in the Watergate affair around the later retired president, Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the presidency of the President of the Justice Department."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of republican and democratic senators set bill on Thursday, after which the special promoter could no longer be dismissed."</seg>

<seg id="1519">"in the western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has been replaced by the scarcely seven-fold Berlin of Berlin's horseshoe."</seg>

<seg id="1521">"over a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres big colossus will now travel north and will probably need two, three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice-giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent climate change has played a role in the collapse of the Eisberg is unclear after researches.</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, for about 30 years a series of unusual interruptions of cuddly loops in the region, the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) writes in a facet background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The fracture that has now broken down has been part of the Larsen-C ice shelf so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Ice shelf floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and interrupts regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"to the north of this shelf, the balance of waxes and abruptions was disturbed some years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI scientist Daniela Jansen writes a complete ice shelf there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to argue that even the Larsen-C ice shelf is in danger, as the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is at present."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice plate is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece is breaking at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of ice-ice and iceberg does not increase sea level since they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice cream leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow more quickly than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly raise the sea level, but only in a low degree, the British research project to observe the Antarctic (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI data, the Larsen-C ice shelf is the fourth-largest horseshoe of the Antarctic with almost 50 000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and no direct connection to climate change is conscious, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most farthest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists argued whether the Larsen-C ice shelf will grow again or go back in the long term, and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these explorers do not lead to the collapse of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, in recent decades many cuddly hooves of the Antarctic peninsula are discarded."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long zip of Antarctica stretches in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the British Antarctic Survey's research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature increased.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"the Antarctic Peninsula has heated up around three degrees over the past 50 years, thus contributing to the areas in which the temperature is fastest."</seg>

<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should orientate itself externally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-entry and include an education offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>

<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa have, above all, an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the Code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>

<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but their legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter faced tears in her eyes, folded hands and downward eyes, when she was condemned."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have reversed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to court. "</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>

<seg id="1674">"but Carters lawyer said it was a" "terrible circumstance" "that she completely regrets."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her" "age or maturity" "or even her mental illness would have a significant impact on her actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a public prosecutor was reading a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy who said that" "there is no day in which I do not feel the loss of my beloved Son."</seg>

<seg id="1680">"the case appears to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case attracted national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, spring from a building, stab yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>

<seg id="1810">"the employees of the weekly Riodoce meet normally on Wednesdays to review their plans for the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They have been told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the Reporter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and stomach-feelings are sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the leaderboard of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has taken office in December 2012. at least 25 years since President Enrique Pena Nieto has taken office in December 2012, and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"the latter is the editor and inspiration of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Special Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, she only introduced two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of murders, which are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists are rarely put to trial."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are not comforting, even though the terrain is even more treacherous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we mistrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he just managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with" twelfth river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or more people are shot in the streets, or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums of drug-kings that are bigger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute, that there is a state of" tranquility "when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with his guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"at first there was in February the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, gang members suspects any copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security following the confiscation of another newspaper published in the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were assuming he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined Riodoce with five colleagues and sold 50 USD investments.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved publishing hard-looking investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV. "</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not tell what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team misses Valdez, the Spaßvogel, who was like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask them: was his love for routine destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home runways and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing is done with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smugglers, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, no mobile phones were allowed. days before it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the Riodoce offices in a four-story building in a mid-class neighbourhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers, whom the governor himself was not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has printed three major stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state spending concentrated on the home city of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which reigned almost the whole century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors have been indicted for high-caliber cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locale, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, readers of Valdez had considered the most informative source of abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" El Flaco "because of his slender body stature."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was devoted to the storage room for signs and stickers, which protested against the murders of journalists, because the staff had become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snatched a few signs and the next morning he went to a demonstration because of another journalist in the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing that it is theirs."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country, journalists have become louder by writing down in organized protests" SOS Press "on pavements and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"during a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and letting them kill them, because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has been asked to re-divide it from the government because it is concerned that their anger has hurt their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "surrounded" "in Mexico by organised crime, by participating government officials and a uniform society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book," Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs but also on orders of politicians and security forces that were stuck with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"" "Articulo 19" "media asset group has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists and officials over the past year."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to hold the mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas card:" "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and earphones were in addition to their segregated head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some branches have chosen to close, as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a editorial on the title page with the heading" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking is troubled."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I became a reporter," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the pavement in front of the office and drank beer, when suddenly all their phones began to summing up."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shooting fights with band rivals and security forces near the beach Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">"the war escalated, as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region."</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the kerbs, they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Siren heulten near - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez looked at the police officers who kept guard to see if they were ready.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his traces."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you just think about closing," "said Bojorquez," "If the same day, when Javier was assassinated, the trainees asked me to send them to the streets."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaur used camouflage to evade his enemies</seg>

<seg id="1925">"it was so good that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said that she had had something of a" "restless past". ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described it as" the preserved dinosaurs, who was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">Fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as" "really remarkable" ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-glutton is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"Shawn Funk found it in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that was lacked out of the surrounding rock at the plateau, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy ground clumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just flashes a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell museum where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found that these herbivores, although covered with armor and resembled a changing tank, were probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter shading, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have allowed him to get better in his surroundings and dodge his enemies, experts say what is suggesting that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now displayed in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours in revealing it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is by far outgoing the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it suggests that dinosaurs were hunted by meat-eating dinosaurs, that the evolution favoured the deterioration of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the shady - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur carnivores must have been the Cretaceous-time," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was rotbraun.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal in indications of his life, including his conserved bowel neck, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at this time Alberta was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with skid skin but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you only have a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous time was a time when huge diodes, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk as he founded the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the upholstered dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that rose from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater refunds of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the Hautreste still cover up bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as' rare as a profit in the lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armored plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right foot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at its sole.</seg>

<seg id="1977">"it was a matter of mild to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large number of emergency vehicles were charged at the accident.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It's a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing is stuck in the train and sleeps.</seg>

<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn currently testes the easy-to-manage ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you have taken up your seat and thus devaluates the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">"currently, a test operation is running on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer arrives, we extend it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"at the beginning of next year, it will probably be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany," a railway spokesman said. "</seg>
<seg id="1998">"" "comfort Check-in" "is the train ticket devaluation with no sheepskin."</seg>
<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use this, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have an online ticket booked - which already do most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it is also necessary to have purchased it via the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">Last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" "comfort check-in" "works: one climbs into the train, calls out his ticket under" My tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"with the test customers, a button for the electronic devaluation will appear."</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and occupied the reserved seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"when the train attendant comes to rank Y at the ticket inspection, he knows that a passenger is sitting there with already purchased online ticket."</seg>

<seg id="2012">"those who often take the train, know that besides delays and missed trains, the ticket inspections are one of the biggest annoyances."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"because often you have, in any case, one of the fellow passengers does not have all the documents required for the devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train guides and passengers, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in controlling their own tickets and takes the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that's only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2024">"confused, since nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was killed by Michael Brown, an unarmed Black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., to tweet live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretching out on the street and staying there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," "thought Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She left her mobile phone to return to Tweets later in the evening via people on Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people crying out, and from a man who claimed to be Brown's father who had a sign with the inscription:" Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">"she watched a live feed, where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman told his rifle and cried out," "I'm going to kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell said to her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the type of murder that we have used to and which we can typically call.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was mad and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 11 o'clock, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11th century."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance originating from the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand responses."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a cauliflower and a fitting crown to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We now go to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them with me," "Ferrell said later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">"it must know it, and see it and be enlightened."</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she does not personally experience latin racism, she is not different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter have joined with a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">"they prepared bags before and helped, to pass them on to demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="2054">"slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the minority student Nurses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"one question came Ferrell in mind:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism has been nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "we heard people who were born and raised in Ferguson were not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt mates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment gave birth to the project, along with six other natives followed the team of Whose Streets?" during the years after Browns's shooting. "</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are portrayed, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr's's experience - to show that the movement is" not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it turned out to be the most open participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of Whose Streets show surprising personal aspects of Ferr's life, as she falls in love and marry her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "Ferrell said, and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanizing of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferr's's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 embossed the film" BlackLivesoft "in social media, identify itself as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," "said Ferrell, and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement is really held up by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "when Ferrell has been selected as the heart of the film because of her identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although it was at the forefront because in a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense her energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news-cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial relations between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Farrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she is clinging to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she went into Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves people, even though it has not been built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone splits the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves any cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit gallery tell:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be real class "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" don't need a person "(Siggi bots) or simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while advocates build that a gallery will attract more customers to the city, including the rest of the business, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the property on which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketing their products offer."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of the construction work will end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - a Beda-Platz with a possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been shopping for many years almost every week in the peasant market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the countrywomen are very happy again and again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">There is also this in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "whether direct marketing in a market hall is located in the gallery, it depends on the amount of rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this should not be very low in the new project." "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is a shopping mall in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is maintained."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shops in a shopping centre are rented only by bigger companies, because the hiring there are often unsustainable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, there are no more special shops and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the peasant market stand during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit-gallery really comes."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the GAT bit Gallery manage to sell all stores from Bitburg before?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, nobody needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant market hall, thanks to the crazy many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no longer place."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfner and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison in Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year jail sentence after she publicly announced diplomatic reports about the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (a suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg whose discipline harmonized her expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a Transwoman, and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"through the algorithmic analysis of DNA that has been extracted by Manning, Dewey-Hagborg originated, as someone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, though somewhat intellectual comment, not only to the formability of DNA-data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 because of 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a granular, black-white selfie, in which Manning visibly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg originated straight from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"the artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts like cigarette stumps and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the trash to produce an image of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while they were in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg with a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarnate Muse were to unequal bribes, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic-illustrated comic" Suppressed Images, "which foresaw a future in which the President Chelsailors could transform judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome kind of happy coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government and against transgender forces in order to find new, tweetable ways to solve the rigid divisions, which he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said" "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded with their oversized signature among them (the" i "in their family name is decorated with a heart) an end of" automatic fragmentation, whose basis has been gender, race, sexuality, and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence is written in pencil with a jack-of-all-trades from Cs and Gs and As."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by involving the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological sense, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring along is that our genome will not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, espardent memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as it emerges from the disciplinary barracks of the United States as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they chew up your speech, they have won," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "so never the mouth." ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "said the artist who greets out of Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goose when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition in person - as predicted in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacras, which coincide like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also purposeful, as all in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), where her genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea, like the movement that also stuck behind its emancipation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">"a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who were sought to suspect after a man was stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries."</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued warrants for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, like the acts of the Cook County Local Court."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A joint warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the corpse was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was still dead in the place of action for dead, and detectives investigating the stitches as murder while the police are looking for the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">"since 2007, Lathem has been a professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, the Vice-President for University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had now been in a review and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University."</seg>

<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to address the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police has an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities will help to find the suspects. "</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious hint, who said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"Guglielmi said it was unclear, whether the incident took place on July 27th."</seg>
<seg id="2177">Security cameras have been confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "said Guglielmi."</seg>

<seg id="2261">Some have withdrawn their tricot kernels and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"for a good part of the team, these two-hour break represents a lunch break."</seg>
<seg id="2263">Players who are registered to the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three hour exercise before they return to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6: 30 AM.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"this is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before the Monday became Tuesday. "</seg>
<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of the players, and they actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three sessions of the UCLA should begin at 19: 15 to meet the already packed timetables of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise between the two days is more than a day at which the Bruins moved to the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood conducted practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are to keep 18 exercises over the course of August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy sitting in the Bewl River Valley in Kent, and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says weary. "</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England spanned the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briy May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's that worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters smell of smoke, because at that time a fire kindled because of the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself was there."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome message") it all seems too nice to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" whiskey and began to write. "</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust got the full access until 2006, when the last owner, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to care about the archives, which he described as" hundreds of years in which Aristocrats said, "Oh, throw it on the attic." "</seg>
<seg id="2308">"diaries, Letters from the period of English Empires, cards that represent who had something:" one could think that land conflicts would be boring, "says Rhodes," but there was a birch fighting for the two families. "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"guys, let all go their way!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse himself in the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'The vermicelli Families of Kent and Sussex'," "says Rhodes."</seg>
<seg id="2312">The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest' that tells the story of the Jesuit patent that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell has staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery, which was made only years later when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook to always pay debts and spend money on things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell men redeemed their debt crises, marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise landlocked."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his use in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences"</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the grounds of a Sanatorium in the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature again."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>

<seg id="2354">"in any case, the large-scale entry in the army and the security forces continues."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July Erdogan ordered another 7395 coup leaders, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals used to be the actual masters of the country earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they shared their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"following his victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed the power of the military step by step, not least on calling on the reform proposals of the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought that it won't be any more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often," "said Mr. Sharkey in the release of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his convictions, and select everything from the robot's eye color to the form of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes more troubling, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a stepford-woman look progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpuppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealPresix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there are the RoxxxGold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like" Frigid Farrah, "which gives the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"RoxxxGold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses True Companion's website. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be" "in the mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female features, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (means: resisting) Farrah, disturbing one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"true Companion Roxxxxy used on his website with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then not have Roxxxxy?" it is said on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and increasing sophistication indicate a somewhat darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR recognizes their increasing popularity, they remain temporarily on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what permeates out of the marginal areas may be very instructive with regard to the spirit of time, in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who is booming to have sexually assaulted women."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the devoured body and the stuffed eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots do not represent real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background story, nothing indicating independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total subjugation."</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with trump in the White House everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship, with whom she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and completely strange on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"this is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it is related to me in another context that this also brings significant risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the dismal effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and Trump, we refer to the great possibility that his kittens will no longer strike us."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is an even more difficult long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing are" normalized, "which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today, I find myself amazed by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomical version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how to see his tax return) - both in comparison to Trump in fact a very mild offense."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump passes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as immeasurable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the Carousel in Central Park, the largest of the NYC car park, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"the horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals rotate to look full of fear of their own shoulders."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"so many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are becoming old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help ease IBD (Inflammation)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study maintains exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300.000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance tends to be too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a type of tolerance conducive immune cells in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the components of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan helps to tolerate more tolerant, less flammable intestinal milieus, if the same system also works with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had not been separated, this did not have."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial cells of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were wound up in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they were given to L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how bacteria were affected by the immune system, the researchers, L. reuteri, left in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism which is known as inidol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells such as mice and that most of us Protect L. Cross in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter made in Connecticut was issued next to a yacht from Maine, a firetruck from Wisconsin and a fork-lift truck from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the HMX-1 commander on the eve of the event to his superiors, the deputy naval commander for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter hit the South Lawn on July 17 at 7 o'clock in the morning and remained so long until the lawn between 18: 00 and 21: 00 was evacuated this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of hours a second team would be needed for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security guards of the unit stayed on the ground while on the ground."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"the Hatch Act provides federal, state owned property for political purposes."</seg>

<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," answered the deputy commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">"the event" "Made in America" "was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act."</seg>

<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is most misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD not include personnel costs but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>

<seg id="2895">"regarding the encroachment in Regensburg no one doubt that it is" "shameful and shameful deeds" "that must be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said:" we like to go to the church and that's a foal frescoes. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth," "punches were a very normal educational mean" "to cope with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it would be unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports of the abuse incidents, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger, authored the commemorative band" My Brother of the Pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger's protection," says Ezemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he analyzes the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly is in the 440-page report, which the author commissioned by the diocese Regensburg with the clarification officer Ulrich Weber referred to?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were severely abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to be Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it can be said that by many cases Domkapellmeister R. was used to form physical and psychological violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in high emotionality the punishment for the pupils could also be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to many other accusations, many victims overlooked the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even had positive memories with him in many cases."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen, Georg Ratzinger explains in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence "at the Regensburg Domspatzen, gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"firstly, many students emphasize his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, which became more tangible when a Domspatz brought no top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger always occurs in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"there are eight pages dedicated to him, and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violent excesses at the pre-school also acquired themselves outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, one can reproach him, learn from it too late, or have taken the first hints not seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which it worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally -" "salvation", "" "heaven" "and" "better world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger bears a very excellent testimony," "sincere," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teacher who supplied the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by grapes from children." "</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotion, which sometimes led to spells."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"the fact that he did not only knit with chairs and threw the keys on the ground, but also distributed ear-figs and pulled too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself regretted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"it must, however, be said that such educational methods were widely spread in the questionable time, in the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is actually in this report, namely sexual abuse and violent excesses at the preschool, this is true Bagatellen."</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders if it's not more to do with his popularity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">"many, who never understood him, are still working eagerly on the Bavarian Pope."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report, a lot of abuse was reported on the subject of abuse at the Domspatzen's Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger have put a burden or complicity in the final report with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted to the Cathedral Master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said one of the afflicted to the others," "Everything was very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with clarification of sexual abuse was and is nevertheless that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students share Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: an inquiring student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely insight and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... even for really absurd, to assume that..."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report concludes with the very clear result:" that the students and / or their surroundings confided to him in the run-up, could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse affects, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to speak from any fellow citizen."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in such a way, he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradicted crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, a lot of" "violence" "was to be read by the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "Wegberg" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: yes, this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge detachment from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly what is the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"in fact, it is clean separate: between the pre-school and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, we say again, other reproaches."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were properly shedged and severely handicapped, all acquired at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to have prevailed."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"that was, as most of the witnesses emphasise, the subject of" pre-school "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but not a sadistic force."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims overestimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even have positive memories with him in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most it remains the accusation to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was in charge of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger consistently closed the ears before the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he pointed out this," that in the preschool continues to practice the punishment. ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was needed, as test sentences were banned in Bavaria long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they acquired themselves in a legal grey area, as each one of us knows still."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult to estimate for him, where perhaps the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the admissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the death penalty at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed yes, it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time of that time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" "pitfall of anachronism", "i.e. the danger to assess the past with today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and also not for what was served in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all terrible and I am happy that it will finally be up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time Georg Ratzinger has to take shelter, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, so earing ears and ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he kept strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">What image of his Ravensburger time has Georg Ratzinger played with you for the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of Test Penalty also available in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, there the Domspatzen were just a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not hide in any way that he led an austere regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this has to be said once again: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly be possible for him to form a world trang from the previously well-known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone, you don't even make a big singer and stand before every success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced as Georg Ratzinger during the conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through working on the book and beyond, I experienced Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced over and over again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and cordial good people, of whom one cannot imagine that he could only do something else."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regular contact with him, like many former Domspatzen, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who haven't given him up to this day, that he was once strict to them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are thankful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to which they still look up today and which they adore them downright."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again quite clear: all that is presented to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieves it."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the insurrection would command, a 93-year-old man, who has acquired great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany, no one would know the Regensburg Domspatzen, finally into peace."</seg>
