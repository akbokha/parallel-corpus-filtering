&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , shared the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , got his dream job as cook in the son &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
&quot; the writer of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;

&quot; Louis Gal@@ icia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone , who would hurt his younger brother . &quot;
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; combining his style with his family , it was always something to cook for us to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of dispute .

Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I will always be put in drawer
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston won &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star clear in an interview now unmistak@@ ably clear .
&quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or stuck on the outside label , which with me and the reality mostly have little to do . &quot;
I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; honestly , these things are rather snow@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her as &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the actress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of TV with a casual Dut@@ t and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; she brings the question of the desire for a child : &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new mother Mother &apos;s Day - love is no children &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a single mother of two sons .
the film will run with us from August 25th .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sports Pyram@@ id
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little variation on the beach with some colleagues . &quot;
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden &quot; Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they drove home to the feed trou@@ ghs in fast gal@@ lop . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
and there@@ with the equ@@ est@@ rian career then ended up again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses . &quot;
&quot; he let himself be led with his family about the plant of AL@@ RV , on a horse he could not even have a photo . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and thus also at the CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport assistant was handed over to the man of An@@ hausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sport Pyram@@ id .
hon@@ ours do not lack the sympath@@ etic ath@@ lete .
&quot; black Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blade , Silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blade , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already invited him .
the 18th lau@@ re@@ ate of the sports pyramid is long .
&quot; in Aachen , on Saturday , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; for she is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gym@@ n@@ ast Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the ski@@ pping horse Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sporting legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ field , where the Lav@@ azza price ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and umps policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are in favour of tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are basic , rather philosophical distin@@ ctions . &quot;
about the role of the state .
&quot; in case of doubt , Tr@@ ump does not want to keep it small in doubt , and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to den@@ ounce the economy and regulate it to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely go back to regulation , and he is making a massive tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , states that the state has certain tasks to perform , he has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost wor@@ dless . &quot;
the democratic candidate canc@@ els the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly denied by the state @-@ capitalist Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; on Tr@@ ump , there could be partial internal discussions . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump will build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , and he wants to termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection agreement . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton wants to extend and demand renew@@ ables with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two ri@@ vals are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ ous trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade , but simply better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should also be paid better , says Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wage .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump does to do on this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to rage , then he says he cannot be changed . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
his critics point out that the budget deficit would be even greater .
&quot; on the other side Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
&quot; escape : &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is a part of women who are fle@@ eing themselves , almost everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ sed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at least one year old . &quot;
one has put her little son in her arms .
he is looking curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother gaz@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles briefly and k@@ is@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a vehicle for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
&quot; in the Munich North , they live in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised homes for single @-@ wing women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs created the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich relief agency . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - even not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her run , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically , because torture or death thre@@ aten or because their families send them as hop@@ eful carriers to Europe , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for their escape : &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , for@@ ci@@ ble , hon@@ our@@ able mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
it drives them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; for example , that tu@@ g@@ boats require a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , are mistaken , says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee women would often be considered inferior and mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily . &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; or they do not dare to talk openly about the experienced , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; since they often do not know how to help , more accommodations need only for them , requests B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the question of whether they would benefit from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Francon@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in accommodation of governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fled women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower Saxony and Lower Francon@@ ia , there are stor@@ eys or their own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is missing or both men and women are accommod@@ ated together , there can be - perpet@@ ual violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the wash@@ rooms should be separate , and for women easily accessible , is in the study . &quot;
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush that there is at the house in Munich .
&quot; since we have been talking about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second home .
assistant doctors quar@@ rel@@ ing : demands for new labour camps
representatives of the assist@@ ants have called their union to appro@@ ve new labour camps in their dispute regarding a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work combat activities from the beginning of September .
J@@ DC said that ministers failed to address the concerns of the treaty .
&quot; in July , assist@@ ants and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with B@@ MA . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; to problems , which led to the fact that the Treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In consideration of this , the J@@ DC Committee has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and requested official re@@ negotiations to all your worries . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Committee today made a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council , in order to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating work campaigns that begin at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes resulted that assist@@ ants struck six times this year , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the director of B@@ MA assistant doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ av@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions , which had been endor@@ sed by B@@ MA . &quot;
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants and medical students , that the contract should be advantageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for physicians in England would be compulsory . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture which ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey arrived on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin perc@@ ei@@ ves his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg palace , I cannot for@@ bid the impression that Ankara will most want to reconc@@ ile this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile appeared ev@@ oked and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly about his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but could even improve . &quot;
the next day a newspaper reported that Erdo@@ gan was so da@@ zed as if there had never been anything bad .
&quot; for me , his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had not forgotten anything . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the down@@ fall of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was kind@@ led .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara to fall into the backs of Russia .
&quot; the off@@ ence was even greater , since it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot;
to re@@ build the confidence will be difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media launched a sharp , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything .
&quot; serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting was held only because Putin received an ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , who he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire lie clearly on the hand . &quot;
&quot; first and foremost , Erdo@@ gan needs all the friends he can get after spending the last month at a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat of almost his office . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks against Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they are counting on a late @-@ night ons@@ lau@@ ght on the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television projected cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed once again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti presented it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , since it &apos;s reaction to the attempted power takeover is regarded as a weak response . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin is the pi@@ ke to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , he called for support for the elected state organs . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , a matter of course which itself has a deep fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate themselves from the West and feel badly treated and now allied . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial discussions , both pres@@ idents at the press conference said they did not even seize the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately mis@@ ed it to answer a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank Executive Director , R@@ BS should only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan divided the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the global ambi@@ tions of the bank .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strateg@@ ists have used &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other end @-@ consumers . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds on sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don champion Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to focus more on national brands .
Scotland Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the stock exchange , will change to Nat@@ west . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for the retail business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investment brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming more a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities , and our employees will be working with the customers among these brands . &quot;
R@@ BS has already announced that it will no longer be able to continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the Bank of the brands , because how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Executive Officer . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal about three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , focusing on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori pic@@ ks up the jubil@@ ee when he wins the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in obstacle racing - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 Care@@ er@@ ie@@ ge &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Modernis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans have been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already scored 6,000 wins if he was not just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden almost 30 years in GB which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an unbelievable Jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British yacht race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; in As@@ cot , 1996 , but he also survived a plane crash and got a prohibition on drugs . &quot;

Russian Putin hum@@ bles Stab@@ sch@@ ef Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of the narrow@@ est circle of confidence of Putin many years ago .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed a Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transportation Affairs .
&quot; in a statement issued by the Krem@@ lin , Putin said that without giving reasons , Putin ordered the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential office . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was in Ivan@@ ov@@ s &apos;s position since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned State University of Moscow for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it means ( in Russian ) that he later was the head of the protocol and chief of the government . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o recommended as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confi@@ dan@@ es Vladimir Putin and worked as he was for the Soviet secret services , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both men claimed that the chief of staff res@@ igned on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the ridicul@@ ing of the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was pri@@ zed as a potential president , suddenly wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - ar@@ du@@ ous posts for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin a former member of the State Security Service ( K@@ GB ) .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin reached power he named Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he trusted the most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , since a third term of office would have viol@@ ated Putin &apos;s constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close allies of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination of the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios which produce the series announced his dism@@ iss@@ al in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly exc@@ used on Thursday before the announcement of his dism@@ iss@@ al . &quot;
on the set there was artistic differences and dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; for details on how the character of Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is published , according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios is expected to be published at a later date . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was with it since the first season of the show in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and put my entire lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od in the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a communication published on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible now . &quot;
&quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans , who can only wish for a series . &quot;
the planned broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for 28 September .
Puzzle for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
&quot; a resident of Ban@@ ff requested help in identifying the fish , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could act for sand@@ als , which were mir@@ r@@ ored by a fountain . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry crossing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross dres@@ sings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion for each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the construction stage of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 s@@ lan@@ t ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
econom@@ ist Keith Brown attended a visit to the building site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses to an engineering art from a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the sealing between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total deck de@@ cks at their place and the last section of the deck gets a Bet@@ ong@@ uss for the deck today , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors , said : &quot; the first closure presents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the closure is forward @-@ looking high @-@ performance and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the North tur@@ m@@ deck , which is under construction , we had to close the gap to the north or the country side . &quot;
this was reached by drag@@ ging the northern lift bridge 700 milli@@ metres to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards by a slope of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; because the toler@@ ances that the team worked , were tiny - on each side they only ru@@ sted a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men are lucky to be alive
three men were &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; after they were tos@@ sed by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey .
&quot; Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alarm , the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station , after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay . &quot;
&quot; the three men had difficulty floating in safety , while their boat was moving from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and posed the worst , &quot; &quot; said the head of the Lif@@ ebo@@ at of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the ship rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have been bl@@ amed and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the bo@@ oting engine had a stop@@ per , however , it loos@@ ened itself from the person transporting the boat from the person who was steering the boat . &quot;
&quot; today , someone laugh@@ ed about these men . &quot;
seriously injured - man stab@@ bed his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic off@@ cuts the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old dem@@ ol@@ ished the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ armed with her sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
&quot; on the road , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ wife . &quot;
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building low @-@ priced flats in Braunschweig ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean that investors should be put into duty much more strongly in the future .
how do you react to bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 budget apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; living concept &quot; &quot; for the next council meeting . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; first and foremost , it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a scheme is missing so far .
&quot; said vice @-@ president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all homes will have to be considered social housing . &quot;
&quot; the cheap apartments , however , can also arise in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing construction programme , which will cost millions of dollars and must still be financed , shall provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder editions for investors .
&quot; despite this , so Brat@@ mann , b@@ anners a sharp@@ ening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but the program is not yet complete : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you compare the loss of another 1,@@ 300 inexpensive dwell@@ ings , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , so the bud@@ get@@ ary spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be purchased inter@@ mitt@@ ent bind@@ ings from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into the price fixing . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
for in the west @-@ city run at the end of the season .
some 1800 apartments could be found there back in price fixing for affordable apartments .
&quot; only : this does not want the owners , the apartment building companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically , it is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there should be no concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect there to be movement in the discussion .
&quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
&quot; in fact , I concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean that there cannot yet be a compromise .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it &apos;s fascinating to watch the world changes .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time spending on screens , has been su@@ ed by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later they created a series of animation , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; as many phenomena of pop culture dropped the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
&quot; the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand , which over@@ bur@@ dened the servers . &quot;
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon go has more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ emon that can be tr@@ acked with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photograp@@ hed &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the w@@ ahn and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person sets back every day . &quot;
&quot; cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 3@@ 5,000 users , announced the Washington Post recently that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of followed people who exercise 30 minutes each day , jump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for the health that people want to take &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; get active every day &quot; &quot; because many public messages to health are boring and coming from people looking to look mis@@ erable . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that they are fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also min@@ dless players who always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what &apos;s it ?
it has got a breakthrough .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be repeated over time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world and help many people hunting , more active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the gym@@ n@@ astic
forget the print .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all that im@@ mu@@ n .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
stunning on the floor .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now also Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast died on Thursday as a multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
&quot; her total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team champion A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es cont@@ ests in the Swedish bar during the competition of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and altogether the fifth , while she soli@@ di@@ fies her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment ended .
&quot; she puts this success in the same league as Michael P@@ helps , who brought her sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated her sport for the last three years , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals , which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she expected her last examination in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between her and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the individual competition of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ jana repeated the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of the crew @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted that during their long journey to the top , never to have planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
part of her floor exercises - which includes her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not acci@@ dental .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school excursion into the gym , where Bo@@ or@@ man was trained , became a force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no competition competition , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina easily led through two turns , the picture dec@@ ei@@ ves . &quot;
Sul@@ be@@ bal@@ ken and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Championship title - lau@@ ded .
&quot; she repeated again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and seated on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced her gently as she expected her grand@@ son - a pure form@@ ality - and tears f@@ lowed into bil@@ lowing red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , who is called O@@ ma by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her practice , she threw back the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ ausen , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;

police : 3 victims shot in a series of tracks when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 year old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest ass@@ aults of a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix as they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
&quot; the police told that the triple murder was not the result of a predat@@ or attack , because the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the sho@@ ot@@ ings led the investig@@ ators to see a closer look at them , whether they are connected with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic neighbour@@ hoods within four months and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; announced Howard der K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown Niss@@ in from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder , and it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his elderly , Ed@@ mund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I don &apos;t manage it . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage it .
I did not let myself down on that .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has embark@@ ed on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
Vincent and her husband Vincent said that Ed@@ mund may never be able to see them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing &apos; , &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Ed@@ mund has de@@ vised for &quot; please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs on her own .
&quot; micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say about how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I wondered what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t been asked about the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time because I don &apos;t expect them to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; severe rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue operations in Louis@@ iana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large floo@@ ds in Louis@@ iana forced the governor to call the emergency room on Friday . it is expected all Saturday over with more rainf@@ alls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Louis@@ iana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ds of extreme rainf@@ all , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the governor of Louis@@ iana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to help the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , agreed that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
&quot; Ste@@ ele said that alone , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags . &quot;
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in the south of Louis@@ iana to Saturday .
the weather service negoti@@ ates that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain may fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it was still raining in the Mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river COM@@ ITE near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Louis@@ iana , will probably reach record levels across the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the subur@@ b regions near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a river @-@ down@@ ward floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Tick@@ et@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State Border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached the highest level already at 09.@@ 00 on Friday , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still em@@ ailed people from the flood water in the districts Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , increased greatly overnight . &quot;
he said that another step @-@ in @-@ step who lives near him would have warned him .
&quot; we wo@@ ke up and poured in the water , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife , Hans@@ ford , said they had never seen such a flood of the river in the 48 years they lived there . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were lod@@ ged until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ds were spreading rapidly , as there were still serious rainf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer was reported near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground was considerably su@@ cked by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and road floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants of their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and lesson in five school districts .
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches that now both were floo@@ ded .
&quot; the leader of the community of Rob@@ by Miller , said that the authorities would have saved 72 persons and seven pets , which were washed up by the floo@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will return to their homes again , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed because of flood water and provided sand@@ bags for the residents to take part , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and stores . &quot;
&quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses had been reported as floo@@ ded on Thursday , but no announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; Town@@ son said , and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; punched by spheres , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police agree that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is fired . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot wounds , including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital with his transport to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was punched by balls , &quot; his grandmother told Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the broad@@ c@@ aster . &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family informed the station that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in a critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were just investigating if one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently there had been a fire between several arch@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , se@@ wed the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were sleeves . &quot;
&quot; in this way , there are several armed fighters involved , who were very actively involved , &quot; announced police det@@ rac@@ tors Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are report@@ edly veri@@ fying the monitoring video .
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a trans@@ verse r@@ ack@@ et when she played in front of her house in West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
it is outdated and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I pres@@ ume under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns and for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second : this team has three gym@@ n@@ oses , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren Lau@@ rie &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Kath@@ o@@ lik@@ in , rounds off , makes everybody proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gym@@ n@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American . &quot;
&quot; last year , Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 . &quot;
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas had a surprising Olympi@@ a@@ gew@@ chin@@ in and America che@@ ered .
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they expected unexpected but master@@ ful gym@@ nas@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who won gold at an individual competition event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see gym@@ nas@@ tics in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gym@@ n@@ asts in the team . besides , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that gym@@ nas@@ tics are a costly sport and gym@@ n@@ ast primarily in private gym@@ nas@@ tics that are maintained by parents who are maintained for training , orientation , travel and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gym@@ n@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ clubs are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer by Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes , since they started with the gym@@ n@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; we have to give the churches a my@@ riad , young girls inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access exercise . &quot;
I founded my Turn@@ foundation for 20 years .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable gym@@ nas@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( mainly black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high quality gym@@ nas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gym@@ nas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to be interested in the gym@@ nas@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this true representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , so many young girls are motivated with different backgrounds to start their way to becoming healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
&quot; assist@@ ants would like to organise more strikes , after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts suggestion . &quot;
&quot; the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 assist@@ ants voted for election , rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t had plans to introduce the contract for@@ ci@@ bly and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assist@@ ants will receive a new contract , which includes changes in bed@@ time and weekend work to improve the care of the ast@@ o@@ unding times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chair of the B@@ MA Committee for Assistant Doc@@ tors shared last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; assist@@ ants have given serious concerns to the proposed treaty , especially that it will inc@@ ite the current staff crisis and will be able to treat all the doctors . &quot;
&quot; in just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out . &quot;
efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve disputes through talks have to take part in the government on the contrary and sometimes to a de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened in a promise made Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t made it last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t needs to act now , raise the condition and address the concerns of the assist@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do so , the assist@@ ants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work campaigns . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a re@@ plen@@ ishment of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and physicians were involved to give doctors to the strike post@@ enk@@ ette cover . &quot;
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by adop@@ ting the reform contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; B@@ MA would like to pay a better week of week for the 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , CEO of N@@ HS staff , called on the assist@@ ants to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working campaigns reach nothing that only little , but already strain over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare for patients , nur@@ ses and their families only concerns , ad@@ versity and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we spoke to the committee of assist@@ ants and responded positively to the health ministry as well as other mini@@ stries responded positively to concerns regarding guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whist@@ le @-@ leb@@ lowing . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training courses , additional training for those who return from vocational training , training , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the health ministry regarding the observ@@ ance of agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 per day medication that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day drug after recommended by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ it@@ ant drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the drug is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls .
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ solve , it can flow through the flow of blood and c@@ log the blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk another .
&quot; Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; the draft bill of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg of Tic@@ ino rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health technology evaluation center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person &apos;s quality of life .
experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in to reduce further heart attacks and stro@@ kes among people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture lets voters blo@@ om in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year for the dism@@ iss@@ al of a government report due to corruption removed from office
a culture of political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to know@@ ingly ignor@@ ing widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities such as a anni@@ hil@@ ating government report today .
&quot; Sir Eric Pic@@ kles , former cabinet member , verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and Town Hall officials for ignor@@ ing evidence of election mis@@ use due to &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption treaty , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motifs would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set shut @-@ off bands outside of election cab@@ s to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should have a passport to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must only name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable inks to a person &apos;s finger , when they release their vote to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
&quot; whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non official committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and finance culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s elec@@ tive sc@@ andal in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special electoral court ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was to be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office . &quot;
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal fashion &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic rights .
&quot; Rah@@ man said &quot; &quot; his campaign is based on the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which one person chooses as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud all over the country .
he spoke in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent brief@@ ing - where the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , illustrated , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guiding of ways to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; as proof , pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people in order to vote in accordance with the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ical or Banglad@@ es@@ ish background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour on the basis of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric addressed 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit correspondence documents in order to stop &quot; harvesting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the election directory to be used for immigration and social fraud purposes . &quot;
consider choosing Cho@@ ose before choosing for your identification .
use non @-@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic review of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are in@@ discrimin@@ ate .
a 3 @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic letter selection .
prohibition that political activists edit complete correspondence and envel@@ opes of correspondence .
the police give the authority to set up lock@@ outs for poll@@ ing stations .
a legislative change facilit@@ ated a charge for inti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
photographer prohibition in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the elec@@ tive stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees generally asser@@ t that voters are alone in the electoral cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; astonishing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no complaint was placed .
&quot; the Elec@@ toral Court ruled Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; check @-@ out controls &quot; &quot; of the constitu@@ tions of the Town Hall . &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of the parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and hidden spread of election fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
mad at K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympic @-@ sports@@ men in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have entered this week by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , apart from the Rand and Band , who turned out to be an impressive double @-@ runner of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only ath@@ lete competing for gold , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , if you are allowed to believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olymp@@ ians that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in on the cycling track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush to Twitter , after pictures on which he looks similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the mad@@ ness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I think it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford &apos;s British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ pers Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ ner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes shall be able to pass through as a double @-@ tran@@ sit@@ ter for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African float Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
one course higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the inc@@ eption actor
&quot; another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ alli@@ grap@@ her Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and blonde hair as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian was attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter Ac@@ t@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face @-@ shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory into space : according to this user there is perhaps one reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair .
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter Ac@@ t@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face @-@ form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ used for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ in &quot; died like a pig .
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis of the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Zir@@ m at dr 4x@@ 200m free styl@@ istic te@@ amm@@ el emp@@ tied viewers of the C@@ BC Live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
Canadian broad@@ c@@ aster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float was like &quot; low off &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
&quot; the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was off @-@ off , when he was at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free styl@@ ish@@ ops his own opinions . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS comment@@ ator team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; being excited , he went like a pig , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for that .
&quot; the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ uan , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the bombar@@ d@@ ment 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , making it possible to close the gap to China . &quot;
viewers across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and the language .
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ et , &quot; Does the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ in from China &quot; as a pig has died &quot; ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
the idi@@ ot did not capture that they were still on show .
&quot; Ai Zir@@ han from China was described as follows in the final 4 x 200m arm squ@@ ad@@ ron for women : &quot; &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism of B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter was fast and hard in which many people asked him to speak .
&quot; Twitter users didn &apos;t come back , when they heard how in@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was &quot;
&quot; another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ don@@ ald . &quot;
you represent C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like rac@@ ists . # done .
&quot; shortly after he ap@@ ologi@@ zed Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment posted by Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; We ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comments on a swimming power . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ happy chosen wor@@ ding , we are sorry that it has happened . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
Scott Rus@@ sel &apos;s comment@@ ator colleague had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible that they will be broadcast .
we ap@@ ologi@@ zed yesterday night with our viewers on broadcast and our folders in the social media .
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments relate to the performance of the float and not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy chosen formulation . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the broadcast , trying to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ism , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark indign@@ antly above Mrs who ta@@ sted in the middle of the shop sham@@ eless under@@ wear
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see , when a woman moved out her clothes in the middle of a place to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she numbered her , as she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back into the shelf . &quot;
she continued and ta@@ sted four pairs of under@@ pants at a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone in which the woman ta@@ sted the under@@ pants before she put them back into the shelf
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had ta@@ sted the under@@ wear , she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the display , pulled off her own ti@@ ghts and trousers and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more dis@@ crete spot to do it - she just got there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back on the shelf again . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that her didn &apos;t like anything , and went out and went out . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that she watched someone - or to think about the person who , under certain circumstances , would buy the under@@ pants she had tried . &quot;
&quot; David Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; &quot; How disgu@@ sting to think someone would take home pants that had an other person who had not been washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to pull the garments from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and went out again and she wasn &apos;t washed .
&quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday , August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself against attack by Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it a bit more secure for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Union in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from front or behind , this video will show you how to turn the sp@@ out for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; when you approach you from behind , then you should first turn around so that you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the firing line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then grab the gun between your for@@ ear@@ m and shoulder before hitting his face with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; hit him with your knees in the bar and turn , while the att@@ acker bow@@ ed before pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the barrel and move backwards while they set the weapon on it . &quot;
&quot; with att@@ ackers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line , grab the weapon and turn it away so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the gun from its grip , before moving backwards and set the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that with a rob@@ ber@@ y , it is the saf@@ est way to submit your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;
traveler Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t his tongue for a guide to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller sub@@ trac@@ ted his immune system and stran@@ gen@@ gin@@ ity to a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel writer Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ stain@@ ed his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a flush of a ten@@ er toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before removing each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to let . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought to lick off the sink of a tow@@ ing toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately nothing left what he le@@ aked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine , travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public rail@@ ings to railway stations to sin@@ ks of toilets , the task placed its immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told me : &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was righteous in any case . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample painting showed a lumin@@ ometric number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ re number is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick after their lumin@@ osity rate was over 4000 units , while newly washed hands have one of less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; W@@ right and Finnish producer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; That comes close to the worst that I have stolen in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dir@@ tier than that !
&quot; I will not lick here , because it is disgu@@ sting here inside . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o .

&quot; Vali@@ o Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ hafts and New Categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the director of the film , added : &quot; let me tell me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had made some of the things I need to lick it , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to attach Ian to lick them and others where it was quite difficult . &quot;
I am happy that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .

&quot; as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family ru@@ ined before Del@@ og@@ ging Social House in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left her social apartment after a del@@ og@@ ging with a loss of £ 50,000 , because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bu@@ cock were thrown into S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall after a long list of complaints . &quot;
&quot; after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked residents of the housing association found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; walls pointed cl@@ aff@@ ling holes , wooden boards were torn , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot;
the family was res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who worked for Housing in Corn@@ wall Housing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer available . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is too .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had joined , street fights with bas@@ eball bat , inti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking , and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses included . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ by , 47 whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house that will be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden boards were torn up &quot;
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and had to call the police regularly
Corn@@ wall Housing gathered her and her partners for@@ ci@@ bly by the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ og@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anyone . &quot; &quot;
we lived twenty years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally away , it will become beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have failed to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police was established at regular intervals , for 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the out@@ grown side of the community house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the r@@ enter agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step considering the Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible .
&quot; I appreciate all the work my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message convey@@ s that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ og@@ ation on the floor
workers in the house administration will now have to se@@ agr@@ ass garbage mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ by received a fine , after she ple@@ aded guilty to the possession of a drug of Class B in commercial fores@@ ight . &quot;
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the rooms of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti covered .
the police said they will be del@@ aying ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
&quot; Angela C@@ row from the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police informed that del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants , who do not stick to the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ aches , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour , which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot;
tourists in Portugal set in panic after a ti@@ eff@@ able military jet flies over
&quot; Sonnen@@ an@@ wor@@ er in Av@@ eiro , Portugal lived the shock of her life &quot;
a portu@@ gal@@ is@@ i@@ es@@ ian P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of air strikes drove an unbelievable storm flight
&quot; air strikes announced that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no risk of security . &quot;
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists begin to panic after a fine jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military airplane flies almost in tangible proximity to the sun@@ rises on the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ists jump@@ ed on , understand@@ ably , to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without seeing what came to them by the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers posting videos about the dramatic fly @-@ by in social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Arro@@ yo added : &quot; I was just surfing , and it felt like the plane fell on me . &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
&quot; the Portuguese airline forces announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast , so that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that due to the bad visibility of the area , the jet flew lower than usual , but the air forces insi@@ sted that security at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; this summer , area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people on Madeira Island came to death . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese airline forces announced today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the circumstances - heavy fog and smoke , which narrow@@ ed his point of view . &quot;
the airplane was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify f@@ isher boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worry about Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting on Sunday for the first title win in the new football season .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the Spanish Super@@ cup at the Spanish Super@@ cup towards FC Sevilla , the bac@@ kl@@ ash goes three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the dou@@ ble@@ man must ref@@ rain from using the sub@@ superior cup@@ fin@@ alists and reign@@ ing Europe @-@ League champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot;
also Go@@ alie is missing Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
&quot; the German suffered a bend in the knee in the training , with which the demand for Bar@@ ca at least was clari@@ fied in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete in Barcelona for two years now as number one .
&quot; coach Luis En@@ rique has so far declined to make a clear decision , leaving Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most other races took the step . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , Spanish master dou@@ bt@@ less about the fitness level of the crew , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
also at 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ beg@@ in@@ opp against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co did not really convince .
&quot; in turn , Sevilla has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after an extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims at the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with eleven victories of the record winner in this race , Barcelona has won eleven victories so far . &quot;
MA Long in its own league for table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic Champion .
&quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ots and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the world rank@@ ings first took the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes in World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and the Olympics . &quot;
bronze went to the jap@@ anese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last but not least Chinese at the top Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; MA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they did not have coaches . &quot;
they had with@@ drawn from the tri@@ b@@ une and left their def@@ enders at fair competition alone .
&quot; the matches up here , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said logical . &quot;
after the game gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
MA had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
&quot; after that , he determined the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang on a total of 13 points . &quot;
&quot; due to the supre@@ m@@ acy of Ma , the expected ro@@ using match did not develop . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , there were nevertheless sufficiently breath @-@ taking ball changes to be seen . &quot;
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game around bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White Rus@@ se had moved a ri@@ b injury , after that in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be satisfied with baking . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump adm@@ its ″ great problems ″ in election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states to lose their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now has short@@ com@@ ings of his election campaign in the so @-@ called repub@@ lican High Castle of Utah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire said something like concerns how correspon@@ dents reported .
&quot; after he threw 16 ri@@ vals within his own repub@@ lican camp , there are now dou@@ bt@@ ful doubts about his success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; mistakes are false reports about his candi@@ dat@@ ure , he resum@@ ed his famous media sh@@ ov@@ el . &quot;
Repub@@ lican high @-@ bur@@ gers w@@ ob@@ ble
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ US from June was reported by Tr@@ ump and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in the future , but not by the distance that is common for Repub@@ lican candidates in the federal state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CNB@@ C , Tr@@ ump replied to the question how he wanted to stop the rise of Clinton : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and if afterwards : this will be either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he is doing nothing else than telling the truth .
&quot; if it does not reach for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , this is okay , Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump is said to have threatened to strike funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey results . &quot;
but instead of attacking the Repub@@ lic@@ ans candidates for Congress are stronger than their arms .
Olympia : tri@@ but@@ ary Sc@@ am at D@@ oping Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee immediately agreed to set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had told that the former S@@ printer and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i . &quot;
this was reported to team leader Ken@@ ias from the dop@@ ing inspec@@ tors .
the IA@@ AF World Association provided the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations into an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; according to the results of the study and the subsequent measures of IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; it said in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and released himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accredi@@ tation of the ath@@ lete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i had become more than 800 meters in Beijing &apos;s World Cup in 2015 .
&quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics team leader Michael Red had been with@@ drawn from the Rio Games . &quot;
he is said to have informed about upcoming dop@@ ing tests against cash payments in his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he report@@ edly has been arrested at his return to Nairobi airport . &quot;
&quot; at IO@@ C , Kenya has been under special observation at IO@@ C for many years of dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was pointed out beforehand that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country before summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with WA@@ DA &apos;s rules . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the country &apos;s athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports , alleg@@ ations were repeatedly raised that in Kenya &apos;s dop@@ ing means are easily accessible and there should be a substantial ment@@ ality of sports fraud . &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had been employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
&quot; in doing so , it could be proven that this sport was widespread and systematic in a systematic way . &quot;
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in Shakespeare &apos;s year , the Salzburg Festival plays the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ steins &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mixture - the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly about her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so she is wise , naturally also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very much , my Italian character I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is an enorm@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you can see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ atic@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them . &quot;
they are the same topics and they are as meaningful today as it was back then .
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
London &apos;s school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ t@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer , Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e , said that her family experienced a few weeks ago from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was assumed that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ t@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had anticipated to leave the country @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ t@@ ana and two other school girls from east London asc@@ ended to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria , and within a few months she became a wi@@ dow . &quot;
Rei@@ d says Clinton will stay in the case of election victory at Gar@@ land as candidates for the Supreme Court
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell is the opinion that the next President will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; on Thursday , Rei@@ d said during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to &quot; &quot; with a certain level of certainty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person from Rei@@ d said later that he had not talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the US Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the government &apos;s nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;

the Tre@@ ats Magazine works with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to release a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of Top Models for 2017 for their N@@ U Mus@@ es Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us earlier this year that his naked @-@ magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes , since Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; apparently , he believes that it does the calendar too . &quot;
&quot; we need to return to the presentation of timeless and classical nude , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the release of the Kal@@ end@@ ars . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .

Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t care and comm@@ its Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of people seeking refuge from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , even &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh action of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime counter@@ acts the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government already crossed Kur@@ d stron@@ gh@@ olds before months , 500,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing from Turkey . &quot;
&quot; after the tel@@ eg@@ ulated put@@ sch , there were still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks . &quot;
many will want to re @-@ start in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees , produces refugees in its own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the association of associations charged the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; thus , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the out@@ going pressure on the remaining cur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or exp@@ elled over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
the Federation of associations called for the German government to be &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , too , a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critics take place . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len @-@ Tag destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mics seeking professional existence .

&quot; as the newspaper reported under the call of the Federal Ministry of Defense , the Turks , before the coup , set up the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognised by political persecution in Germany . &quot;
&quot; on the closing date of June 30 , this 11,@@ 386 persons and almost 29 per cent of all called &quot; &quot; asylum @-@ seek@@ ers &quot; &quot; ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) were entitled to obtain asylum . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , it is not those who wage war , poverty , or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the rule of law , individually persecuted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives get nothing of the summer campaign with - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia shall not choose the land day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the country election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; more stupid than so far it doesn &apos;t work : summer holidays , heat and ag@@ ony ground combat - that bit@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaign fighters , are on holiday . &quot;
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers , who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen and Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so do not choose the land day . &quot;
&quot; practical problems come : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and count votes at the end are only lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and the last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign close to the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U @-@ coalition , must fear his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot;
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains in the end Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ dust left .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his large posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ atted a little with the people , as well as his legendary and elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , sailors can get cold feet and ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel gives the blame on the blo@@ om of Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; We create the &quot; &quot; ha@@ sten@@ ed the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is now likely to cost him a beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with her candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you are at the right place in the right place at the wrong time . &quot;
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to grandmother . Merkel &apos;s parliamentary group is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority in other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s a shame not to anybody from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel can listen . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the North @-@ East @-@ CD@@ U no longer ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual stand@@ ings on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this , so , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also realised that in the country , it br@@ ittle the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , hardly any in the expan@@ se of the country . &quot;
&quot; the advice of the CD@@ U electoral campaig@@ ner Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where the people are : village este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called on his SPD to a particularly committed campaig@@ ning . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had clearly won 35,@@ 6 per cent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in surveys , should make the leap into the land day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of their holidays and put their election campaign largely into the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; she calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green bal@@ lot champ@@ ions go on search for native vocal folds among holiday@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ did@@ atin , just cur@@ tail with a hou@@ seb@@ o@@ at by the Mecklenburg lakes and still finds it beautiful . &quot;
&quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; poll@@ ing holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 Ref@@ urb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from blocking
&quot; at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m. , there are everywhere praise . &quot;
&quot; they made everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet gas station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no default .
&quot; the construction site was scheduled to be transferred to the south at the yearly beginning , until the end of October all will be ready . &quot;
&quot; the reward is also the receipt of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft transfers . &quot;
&quot; since the building site has been mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in Of@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg again exists , the traffic situation within the place has eased . &quot;
the citizens can now drive from Of@@ ter@@ dingen to the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asi@@ ve traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some cases of considerable dis@@ comfort , &quot; says the Vice President Florian King for the technical management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; residents of Bach@@ ler@@ strasse , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because there were many cre@@ eping paths and rather familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks were in hiding in residential areas .
&quot; as the speed limits were not maintained , the municipality called for the measuring car from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; says King , who made herself aware of the situation himself . &quot;
two to three per minute have been fl@@ ashed .
the quick@@ est speed was at 77 mph in the speed @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved forward , it has become cal@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again . &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to sales bro@@ o@@ ks , everyone lets you see . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; i.e. produced for other companies , have hardly any consequences for the renovation . &quot;
&quot; even at the deal@@ ership of Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; most slight drop &quot; , &quot; but adm@@ its that of course &quot; &quot; the mil@@ eage is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most strongly exploited are the locals along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak house , formerly the Crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants met it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we need to be happy about every euro turnover .

he had to release half of his collabor@@ ators .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been fired , the policy would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , the host@@ ess would benefit otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now it must also bear the dis@@ advantages resulting from the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;

&quot; after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars are now less frequently passing by due to complicated traffic management , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot go down , it is also somewhere else beautiful . &quot;
&quot; that his trunk @-@ kli@@ ft comes back again after the renovation works , G@@ öh@@ ner does not have any doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crisis with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis that has experienced its inn@@ s in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , it is continuously scre@@ ened in laws . &quot;
&quot; following the recent proposals , Minister of Interior of Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now presenting a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all his proposals are politically unacceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they don &apos;t over@@ call anybody .
&quot; other , more advanced points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; ( users View@@ ing this Forum : 1 ) 1,@@ 50@@ 6 120 &quot;
&quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was on results and at a &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has shed a little time before he presents his conclusions for the security in the Republic . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; some things have already been announced , announced , announced , that a new security authority is to take care of the cr@@ acking of co@@ ded communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; also , it is not the fact that Germany must implement multiple EU guidelines on passenger data and arms exports . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second trial for proposals not to be done with the SPD : he wants to pun@@ ish sympath@@ e@@ tically for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; declares the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; however , he still considers this to be reasonable and doesn &apos;t require any chance at the coalition partner . &quot;
Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also presenting a few new ideas .
they have partly in themselves : he plans quick processes for deport@@ ations and more opportunities for the incar@@ cer@@ ation of people before the deportation .
&quot; refugees who are directly fet@@ ched into the country should check their smartphones before , and disclose social media accounts for a safety check . &quot;
&quot; in cases of tolerance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately om@@ it their documents to obsc@@ ure their identity . &quot;
some of them are political and legal .
some still works uns@@ ett@@ led and leaves questions un@@ answered .
&quot; and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient , for example , the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , in the face of the high refugee numbers , many people were worried about security . &quot;
&quot; and things , which the people deeply occupied , did not let themselves be cl@@ inging up in campaign hours . &quot;
the inner security has moved immen@@ sely into focus .
&quot; the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elections . &quot;
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking a position on the issue of internal security .
&quot; in the past few days , the two parties went up . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ sty dispute about the furn@@ ishing of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the R@@ ess@@ or@@ chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship . &quot;
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , too , is struggling with con@@ cili@@ atory notes . &quot;
&quot; from a revers@@ al of the double @-@ pass , he doesn &apos;t hold anything . &quot;
ISO @-@ 8859 @-@ 9 ( Turkish ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 10 ( Latin 6 )
re @-@ open it is not useful .
&quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package at all corners is constitutional and whether it is indeed &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it is only necessary to show itself . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot inside that could worry about stri@@ fe .
but the SPD is currently trying to profile itself on the issue of internal security .
&quot; the party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel signals carefully the willingness to talk and say : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which helps to increase security further . &quot;
&quot; still , Volkswagen is lim@@ it@@ less . &quot;
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery figures are rising worldwide . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not operate in all markets . &quot;
&quot; in the recall action , vor@@ tices are about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts with deliveries more restra@@ ined in the second half @-@ year .
&quot; despite its many brands and a number of well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer continues to boast a plus in spite of its many brands and a number of well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the core brand , VW , weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and thus weigh@@ ed back the total sales , such as the company listed in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; globally , the VW brand in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe , the second most important market in China alone , sales remained 14 percent below the same period last year . &quot;
&quot; in the home market Germany , the deliveries declined by almost one sixth . &quot;

&quot; in addition , there was a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets through &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU also explained a spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust gases were first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony is further lim@@ itated by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an ex@@ tradition minus from 0.9 per cent comes to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , group sales Chief Fred Kap@@ pler continued to present a sales plan . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen supplied 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen has been rig@@ or@@ ously manipul@@ ated with a software testing .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW calls about 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW confirmed that the conversion of cars had no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the autom@@ aker puts out a &quot; guarantee equal &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
cause of j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen would now grant its German customers a guarantee of standard diesel models .
&quot; this would have been confirmed last Monday , VW representatives in the German Transport Department . &quot;
the Ministry of Transport has confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my investig@@ ative commission and the KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; said Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to Ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after retro@@ fitting are not deterior@@ ating and all type approval @-@ relevant vehicle values remain un@@ affected . &quot;
Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not what it meant in corporate travel .
&quot; in the wide term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , customers come to a workshop half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot; &quot;
Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from sufficient savings in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; on Thursday , bank manager Josef Paul said : &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot;
&quot; the German Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal : ordinary sa@@ vers should not &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; to pay for their bankrupt@@ cy pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; if banks are depos@@ ited money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ al interest . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on checking account or day money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for quite some time , he kept 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not exploit . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and generate 0.4 percent of the costs , &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; according to the poll@@ uter pays principle , the cost is now further . &quot;
&quot; to leave the cash in the v@@ aults of the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four surprises , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the Bank Executive Officer . &quot;
most customers could have understood and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the co @-@ operative association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy of the ECB is causing considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; to bear them alone , be &quot; &quot; business @-@ economically permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
the Thur@@ ing@@ ian Volks@@ oper and Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines in 2014 with pen@@ alties for in@@ soles of three million euros .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Union , said : &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay total fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client@@ ele that is more opul@@ ent from the property . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; if they feed free money . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; currently there are no further banks known to the cooperative association of Bavaria , which comp@@ ute a substitute for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; said Spe@@ aker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Bundes@@ verband of German Volks@@ banks and Raiff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it is threatening the emig@@ ration of investors to competition . &quot;

destination plates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
sol@@ itary men of middle @-@ aged love plates .
&quot; before you rush to the comment section to over@@ see it under the pseud@@ onym &quot; &quot; Non@@ Alle@@ man@@ y@@ men &apos;s Middle Ages &quot; &quot; with harsh ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much @-@ spoken revival of vinyl records is not to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to a mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all forecasts up to the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ de by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers maintain their emotions rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .

&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill out the buildings where once independent sellers had been resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plate speci@@ als . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to judge their age and mind by observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of records : two young women , three men of middle @-@ aged ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of records : eight middle aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and walks through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards . &quot;
&quot; these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by email , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy items that he sold when he was young and ready . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70 &apos;s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably were too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers , whom he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media @-@ pub , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and set themselves to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
that would explain the boom to followers of the record audi@@ ting of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ on@@ ica to realize that plate business offers a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers took the imp@@ etus to cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some board fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of trusted record covers , from objects that call up happy Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ inner@@ ungen . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is a collector so I think it is so with many people .
it &apos;s a simple way to concern yourself spiritually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; in@@ still@@ s a staff of a pile of panels . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people , who bought a record last month , have not yet listened to . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a turn@@ table that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record not have record players . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried , while I was pu@@ zz@@ led by a pile of Bos@@ sa nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( quantity : three middle aged males ) , has noticed a &quot; trophy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone just came here and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own record players but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead disc so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a large percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ based , less musi@@ cally . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who only slowly enter . &quot;
&quot; pit@@ stop , which has dedicated the vinyl records almost a whole story , has a b@@ lower audience when I enter . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle aged teenagers . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest synthes@@ iz@@ er- and sex@@ packed pop rather than experimental jazz dr@@ illed out of the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks strange , but nag@@ ging mental trau@@ mas are hard to set if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale . &quot;

&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh . &quot;

my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of board lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I pret@@ end to sample the jeans hot pants , I watch a group of young girls who sit around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; the left is a staircase , a wall full of boards from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; however , considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and board enthusiasts who exist in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they do not spend their Thursday morning with certainty not to w@@ ander through record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates while looking at the star@@ ing view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false Moder@@ ator who raises nothing of middle @-@ aged men &apos;s shoulders above the shoulders . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French Court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais claimed that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary transactions in which people sell goods ranging from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , selling hair@@ dressing services or selling tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be dem@@ ol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and san@@ ity .
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported unions and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the provisional businesses and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot;
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people running the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture are absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feed people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the precip@@ ice was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &quot; Café of the camp , which is non @-@ serving and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to protect the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant closure &quot; &quot; for those children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two help organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants rated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - following a sharp increase in new arri@@ vals over the summer . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adjust to the next generation speed monitor : in different federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new lightning devices are tested , the tem@@ pl@@ ün@@ der should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the fut@@ uris@@ tic En@@ forcement Trailer of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accidents , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to renovation bridges with temporary tem@@ pole , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary bl@@ unt for adher@@ ence to speed limit . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days , while the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be detected across multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans by time , timet@@ ables and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the highly driven state , it is possible to drive the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply ch@@ ew@@ ed , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also van@@ ish the outer shell . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the shar@@ pen@@ er from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer for details of Vit@@ ronic has been tested in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also have a new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 copies after an order of 150 copies last year . &quot;
great Britain scores silver in 7 @-@ way rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji gets Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium here in Rio .
&quot; Fi@@ ji issued a master@@ class in handling , side step@@ ping , back up , line @-@ up and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was missed by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ k , 7 @-@ 5 in semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it might be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head trainer Ben Ryan , the former chief of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
&quot; this fl@@ ap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and allowed the GB@@ s to blast it out of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . as if you were running in running buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au drow@@ ned in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with just four minutes playing time , J@@ erry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a tough@@ er cr@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the Berg of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute lete j@@ aza Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch down and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ introduction and there was still a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still missing . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB introduced basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua ran through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an experiment for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South Pacific , whose fans che@@ ered , flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
&quot; the whist@@ le rang , the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced themselves and GB kick@@ ed anni@@ hil@@ ated in the grass . &quot;
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown drove the boat in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team ensured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning are inspired by the fight with the coach of the coach
&quot; there will be no more remote gold than in these games , and that will mean something . &quot;
&quot; from the first ru@@ d@@ der to last , 220 hard si@@ eves enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning invented an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who sat on the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was omni@@ present when they row@@ ed the second olymp@@ ic old in the history of British sports , who put such a y@@ ard@@ stick . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all their 39,@@ ter was un@@ defeated , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the way of triumph . &quot;
&quot; behind each of the gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental progress that could make the difference , and nobody knew that he would survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ked . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was fortunate that he was able to start treatment in early 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that was the right concept in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to get better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing on itself is already a challenge , but that makes it even greater . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts came to Williams who spent a nerve @-@ rising morning to talk more than usual and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , who was the captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that &apos;s maybe a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much to me this means , how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were not able to keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Helen cried , &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something T@@ oll@@ es .
&quot; today we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
glo@@ ver needs to appear next week on a wedding , your own with the TV adventure Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , retired . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot;
a small Francon@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
this meant some time ago in the original one in a contribution by Bay@@ erischen Rund@@ fun@@ ks .
&quot; a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Francon@@ ia paid tribute to the association . &quot;
the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group applied &quot; Bavaria far as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was in the ken@@ nel association for 31 years , 28 years as managing director . &quot;
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , based in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , the commun@@ e of Breit@@ brunn , promotes about 15@@ 0000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the municipalities are Kirch@@ ner , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the City of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
&quot; the current president , Breit@@ brunn &apos; Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller in 1985 was appointed a water wart and appointed Managing Director of the T@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his duties have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organization work , the bud@@ get@@ ary plan , calculation of fees and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , it called the start @-@ up and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and for the rehabilitation of the high vessels ( 1999 ) , the new creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial re@@ constructions of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no stand@@ still and there was always new additions , because water lives and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their lau@@ d@@ atio , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has spent himself with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association , and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association quite literally as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reductions before the water forum of the Lower Francon@@ ia area . &quot;
&quot; for that , he received a lot of recognition and praise . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on his part , praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water@@ man and he was a faithful servant .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as the highlights from his point of view , he distinguished the well @-@ being and the re @-@ structuring of the appropri@@ ation association . &quot;
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the tough@@ est use were the quar@@ ry at the higher bin at Kirch@@ ner on a third of January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained by filling up the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the Dr@@ inking Water Training Association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who joined Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

&quot; on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district of Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and wounded her . &quot;
&quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is fle@@ eing , and after him I will be publicly punished . &quot;
&quot; now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters large , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a glass candle . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man has a bald head . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the gun , so the police . &quot;
&quot; who sees Sven S. , shall call the 110 . &quot;
the police are talking about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the responsible police in Lübeck wanted to make no information about the wai@@ st@@ line or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; however , she confirmed that a human being was killed . &quot;
it is a deli@@ ri@@ um deli@@ ri@@ um .

&quot; according to eye witnesses , a special emergency squ@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Flas@@ h@@ back for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens , which threatened the sector from green electricity extraction , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it remains in the liberation of the Renew@@ able Energi@@ es Con@@ dition among existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ flow production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Commerce Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach that after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption , at the cas@@ hier . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry had additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , there is an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent . &quot;
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission on self @-@ determination .
&quot; thus , the status quo of the current regulation was largely determined . &quot;
the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; with regard to our &apos; steel future &apos; campaign , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are weigh@@ ed down , &quot; said IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and a significant price pressure .
&quot; last year , the situation continues to wor@@ sen as the world &apos;s largest producer country China threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers repro@@ ving Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , import duties are shown on import steel effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have risen . &quot;
it is unclear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; last but not least , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude closing statements of individual works . &quot;
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 86@@ 0,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than the previous year &apos;s mon@@ ate , as Steel &apos;s economic unification reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the assembled crowd went back to the second month in a row . &quot;

&quot; community , spirit , health : singing is good sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in the teacher &apos;s studies she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and lively , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler tells of the German sen@@ iors division . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular mer@@ ging , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and foster social contacts . &quot;
&quot; often social and family structures dis@@ solve in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to arrange oneself and organise oneself on the other and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense .
this is because sen@@ iors training a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly call his lungs are not so quickly out of the pu@@ ff in everyday life .
&quot; when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of the Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; by lyrics and especially melodies , the person suffering from dementia causes long past events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head is also required to perform special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm , and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; just elderly people , who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I am doing something for a long time , I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try out a new hobby doesn &apos;t hesitate , even if he means having little talent , advis@@ es L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who li@@ stens to you when a sound comes next to it ? &quot;
&quot; in the search for the right offer , senior citizens have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior choir , one can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ as@@ tical choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with internet research . &quot;
&quot; anyone who wants to sing should join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to any age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers on cri@@ es of the young
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hannover which effect the tail of k@@ itt@@ ens on adult animals has .
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust did not let the males cold - however , they beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al level of k@@ itt@@ ens by the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster to lu@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens , which are in great need , as scientists have found out of the Veter@@ inary School and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens , however always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young animals are either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; journal . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differs with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight female que@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a short break of babies who were taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of stronger red k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised additionally . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; all females , even those who had not own offspring , re@@ acted differentiated to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned faster to the speaker when this rep@@ ut@@ ment of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens was playing .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have repeatedly studied the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to babies , whether they were pregnant or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; after Super@@ cup &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ley@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey once again takes place an important football game . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; already in the case of susp@@ ending the state of emergency after the attempted assass@@ ination attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , should not be com@@ promised . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , whom one is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it will not stop before football . &quot;
&quot; against the former St@@ ark@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ßer , the prosecution issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; according to that , the addi@@ ct living in America is being accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ kü@@ r is to be a member of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; it is true that the state of emergency , initially for 90 days , is valid until October , in fact it has no effect on the life of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the no@@ c@@ turn@@ al &quot; &quot; democracy &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in p@@ endants and opponent Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &apos; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends .
&quot; but , in view of the dramatic experiences in history , the indign@@ ation of the Turks is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Poster Win@@ ner &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; , &quot; it will come back to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski again . &quot;
&quot; he proved his sporty value in the season &apos;s ex@@ pi@@ red season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as top scor@@ er of his association . &quot;
&quot; in the final game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 winner . &quot;
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ I@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy to his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the preliminary round @-@ K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the south via Li@@ g , it reached only sixth . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to gain something .
&quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title with 26 season ap@@ pers as the Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ tex @-@ King . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; on the occasion of the AC Florence under contract and on Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the Gom@@ ez was announced after the coup attempt , not to return due to the political situation in the country after his EM vac@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club Director F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; but the storm would have to be willing to ref@@ rain from around one third of its estimated 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man made clear : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these ath@@ lets still have medals at Olympic Games in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin had already been locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova won &apos;t start in Rio .
others over@@ run Athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio to get medals .
dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines for the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had su@@ ed for a dop@@ ing lock in front of the games shortly before the games , was mer@@ cil@@ essly fl@@ atten@@ ed and laid out at her start ( 100 m of chest ) . &quot;
it was a bizarre scene : she was still in the hall with an open smile and prov@@ oked her performance with her appearance .
&quot; when he was arrested that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a blast of che@@ ers . &quot;
but there are many other sports@@ men who are going to start the Olympic Games in Rio in spite of the dop@@ ing past .
here an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial characters in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked twice for dop@@ ing two times ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after it was detected by the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had a strong pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( disc@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 , World Champion of 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 has been positively tested on the prohibited stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl hex@@ an@@ amin . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the know@@ ingly taken ing@@ es@@ tion and was closed for six months .
the four most far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big favor@@ ites .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Peking Olympic champion and two @-@ time champion over 400 m , had been tested positive in 2010 and had been locked for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement have been responsible , mut@@ ed Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ed , Belarus ) : hardly an ath@@ lete was det@@ ectable as many medals as possible . &quot;
so T@@ ich@@ on lost its World Cup title of 2005 nine years later after it was detected with him testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympic Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ing and the European title in 2006 for testosterone abuse .
&quot; the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , which was also recognised in 2008 , was reg@@ ained due to a part of the International Sports Tribunal . &quot;
with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is rank two of the world rank@@ ings .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Walk , China ) : the world record artist and gold @-@ fav@@ ori@@ tin has been tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion found evidence of taking a prohibited dietary supplement , the lock of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran off on July 13 . &quot;
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al deaths
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand reads in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday @-@ early . &quot;
&quot; she suffered from cutting wounds and had been treated at the hospital , but had already left it again . &quot;
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he also Austrian citizens affected are still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , in this regard , is in constant contact with the local authorities , so brand@@ y . &quot;
&quot; in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a shel@@ ving quarter two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai @-@ woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , two sy@@ ring@@ es were once again high , and a further human being was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
Ph@@ u@@ ket reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
&quot; in det@@ on@@ ation near the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal staff . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ inct of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police . &quot;
&quot; finally , Det@@ on@@ ationen in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the south @-@ east coast called for several injuries . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bomb att@@ endants carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said Ar@@ ag@@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Free day before journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to speak about possible motives , but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bomb attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ rec@@ tionary movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is just a local sabot@@ age confined to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret references to forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed of the exact time and the places . &quot;
it is still unclear which group behind the attacks .
&quot; police rejected their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings , airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they are not directed against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that has been used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; following the massive bombs explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( secur@@ tier 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after con@@ front@@ ations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary journeys to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military much influence over the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos , while the country moved towards stability , an improvement of the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody tur@@ mo@@ il , keeps himself too good to have led the kingdom again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip for the insur@@ rec@@ tionary rebellion of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
&quot; just a year ago , in Bangkok , at an attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine , 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; the Right &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; has come into the visor of the Federal Office for Protection of the Constitution . &quot;
&quot; according to several national offices , the constitu@@ tion@@ ists have also under observation the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &apos; identical movement &apos; evidence of efforts against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; said Grund@@ schutz@@ systeme , Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß der Deutschen Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in such a way , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are in an extrem@@ ist way de@@ fam@@ ed . &quot;
this is why we now observe the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; mul@@ ticul@@ tural mad@@ ness &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by over@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in nine federal states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; identified . &quot; &quot;
&quot; during the decision , Mao said , his authority was closely coordinated with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the executive director . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful speech , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertising campaign for your own cause .
propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible to attack .
this is dangerous .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I have no knowledge of that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant at a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with regard to the marked increase in ri@@ cot@@ ic crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have seen in recent years that there can be right @-@ wing structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it may well be that other right @-@ wing groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
but a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
previous groups have emerged on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; he was concerned about the fact that many over@@ laps went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the suspic@@ ious attacks on asylum in@@ ventions were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many individuals have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , perhaps politically in@@ different , or , for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , have radic@@ alised themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records are not always deter@@ red by the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courage@@ ous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight swimming pool from Ethiopia was so slow that it was no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transformed into a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his course for 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not sporty character that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start@@ right from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in the presented countries better known .
&quot; because in Eth@@ op@@ ia most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the round .
some media called him the &quot; ro@@ uble of the whale . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; well @-@ being b@@ ump , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made fun of him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he beat about 100 m Fre@@ estyle with a minute and almost five seconds , played no part . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i ensured media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a run over 100 m of Fre@@ estyle alone . &quot;
&quot; fr@@ en@@ e@@ tically , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time . &quot;
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympic Games and had never taken such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the imp@@ ending election defeat so narrow
Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at a campaign event in Florida .
&quot; if there is nothing to do with the election to the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already had an alternative video . &quot;
he then dri@@ fted into the holiday .
&quot; after Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it would not matter : &quot; in the end , it will either collapse , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Repub@@ lican candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV station CNB@@ C . &quot;
&quot; if it does not reach for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this is okay , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; so he called US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
in his party more and more resistance was formed .

an electric @-@ delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .

&quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we change the whole fleet .

the GfK research firm GfK tau@@ scht its chief Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the cuts came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company GfK announced that the chair of board Chief Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the success promised by him . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
GfK Executive Chef wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; as of September 1 , the management board of the Management Board will take over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ jer@@ inger , informed the company . &quot;

accidents - bus sli@@ ps into cock@@ ro@@ aches in dit@@ ch : eight injured
&quot; in an accident of a touring coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered serious injuries , reported the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to give her information an opposite vice , which was partly on the return track . &quot;
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ person for the Police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independent , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ance coaches and an emergency doctor came to the accident scene at Landes@@ straße 2 ( Landes@@ straße 2 ) .
the un@@ adul@@ ter@@ ated trav@@ eller was brought back by a regular bus to the Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ ner @-@ district P@@ ew@@ sum .

the investig@@ ators called for the veter@@ ans and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , the fees per cubic meter of waste water amount to 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.10 € for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sche@@ Wasch@@ 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water charge will increase once again if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a low co@@ efficient calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the hom@@ olog@@ ation of the household by the Federal Council of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , Kul@@ mb@@ ach found that under cover for these wast@@ ewater treatment systems . &quot;
&quot; due to legal bases , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the facilities . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg will have to reach deeper into the wal@@ let . &quot;
the rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as head of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel , a new calculation of the fees for the waste water installations of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous cal@@ ulation period can be equ@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt explained the increased fee increases by relatively small facilities with a very low waste water fall , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; in this way , due to the low distribution basis , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the wast@@ ewater volume in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , during the rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation period of all three systems , renovation and repair costs fell in a considerable amount due to the age of renovation and repair . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ is@@ ers , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp , almost 20 years old . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced by a pollut@@ ant in the Az@@ endorf wast@@ ewater treatment plant .
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage slu@@ dge was depl@@ eted after almost 20 years , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be installed and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; on these extraordinary expenses , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period , came into consideration . &quot;

stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water fall in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance &quot; are full .
Schmidt continued to have spar@@ ed the market community of major entertainment costs in the wast@@ ewater facilities over the past 20 years .
&quot; the situation for the mentioned plants will remain prec@@ arious in the long run according to stone houses , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal drainage association cannot be extended by these facilities because these facilities are defici@@ ent facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were booked .
the annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , compared to the previous month , a rise in the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furnishings , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critic@@ ised as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat enables some 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already bor@@ dered to absur@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ familiar , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million new sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all devi@@ ations get to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were charged that the App Black@@ face would promote or propag@@ ate white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week gave some users a filter , which gave them sl@@ ot@@ ted eyes , false teeth and ev@@ apor@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow @-@ face . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversy had shown a larger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and ou@@ trage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was meant as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter reminded of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others declined the Ani@@ me comparison .
&quot; in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et was widespread over the photos that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and &quot; said to the least unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with contra@@ sting a very reluc@@ tant Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow face was drag@@ ged into the de@@ preci@@ ating extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling wire .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
&quot; and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people , who are more vers@@ ed in the breed than their older opponents - could expect to expect sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates an image that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it &apos;s much more difficult that such things stay un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
she said she said that racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in Snap@@ chat integration practices .
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part of white , only male leadership , and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable in order to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely ignored the Snap@@ chat . &quot;
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its staff , but according to a speaker , the company recently set up a human resource manager , focusing on subordin@@ ate population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; for her part , Z@@ hu said she will be closed to her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; IS@@ IS Secret service information , established by the Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence services to record an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions on the ground had allowed , an inquiry committee of the congress reported in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; preliminary report , created by a task force of the Repub@@ lican Members of the Armed Forces , Intelligence Committee and the Military Committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command secret service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , just Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence services typically kick@@ ed off by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders regularly recorded a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism , as the actual conditions were allowed on site , and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; quoted the report . &quot;
&quot; what has happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Repub@@ lican member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ com extend to the top point of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report highlights detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct indications that government sp@@ ik@@ es under Obama have given orders to change the reports , it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their hierarch@@ ies , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than facts , &quot; the report noted . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com subscri@@ ber publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican representative of K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015 , the Central Command points changed the intelligence reports to run down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic state .
&quot; the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights , while the investigations will continue . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are underway through the Secretary @-@ General of the Defense Department . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Repub@@ lican Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence estimates for IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the high @-@ ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Shi@@ p , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , such as Mr. Schiff , delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; compens@@ ated the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; &quot; gave exc@@ essi@@ vely little space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats gave no indication of the annex@@ ation of the White House at the Cent@@ com analysts with regard to a &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the preliminary results of the investig@@ ators of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor who received complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , announced that the Defense Department had no comment on the congress , while the inspec@@ tors of the General inspec@@ tor were still under way . &quot;
but he also admitted that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these key issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have further effects on the question of a successful aerial campaign conducted under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; the alleg@@ ations last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism with regard to the Secret Issu@@ es on the Islamic State resem@@ bled dis@@ agreements of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , presented a document of how the then government under George W. Bush approached only a small occupation force in Iraq , and had little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the statements of the government , air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these temporary refin@@ eries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature because of his over@@ ly positive app@@ rais@@ al of the war situation during a hearing in front of the Senate . &quot;
general Austin reti@@ res in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with UK faces &quot;
&quot; one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
&quot; that knows , however : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic tournament and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which will remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will gain first and second place each . &quot;
the first place will leave the strong Dutch a little longer from the way the other group will guide .
&quot; as always the game ends on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising s@@ wir@@ l through their success story , four years after they ended up in the past London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time with three years she had a ho@@ ckey r@@ ack@@ et in her hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National player of the United States , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work schedule in London that we now have .
we have been able to s@@ nat@@ ch the helm completely .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area . &quot;
&quot; India had gone into play without a win in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and le@@ aped the ball into the gate to give the American female a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late as it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and in@@ es@@ capable , a rapid relay between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , that is passed from the wrist protection to the swi@@ mmer to the tri@@ ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t switch on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ utz@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock with dimples , could well be among those well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , if he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ n@@ asts or even f@@ enc@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic gym@@ nas@@ tics tournament . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not elu@@ ci@@ date any event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade , are the sports that are not generally accepted : air@@ brush shooting , Arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may there be long .
&quot; but if I should make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ oline jumping has been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ sely perceived the last 16 years that many people I had questioned , did not know that it was a Olympic sport at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it never won a medal in the tramp@@ oline and until 2012 had had an ath@@ lete who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans who share the same for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ oline jumping has a certain outside @-@ char@@ me , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ lown school than the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a gro@@ unded enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact , but also the Gra@@ zie of gym@@ nas@@ tics and diving , which combines two sports , which essentially un@@ ites it . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El oline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; rising winners jump on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling mot@@ ions ( turning , h@@ encing and sal@@ ts ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to official Olympic programme , they are rated according to execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts in their quest for gold continue to go faster , upwards and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and down , upwards and down@@ wards on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they ch@@ ase not only the finish line or the output wall , but in the tel@@ ev@@ ised transmission also another under@@ mining goal : the world or the Olympic record . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is noble , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I think about when watching these games as something .
&quot; of this , the tramp@@ oline offers a resp@@ ite . &quot;
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline bed is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the women &apos;s qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end @-@ hours as part of a afternoon block on both days from 2@@ pm .
&quot; in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the objective of male athletes - as the male U.S. Tur@@ ner has recently proposed to the The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his following air rin@@ se , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia are sti@@ cking to the violent resistance of the government .
witnesses testi@@ fied that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police during shooting .
is Ethiopia just to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the last few months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country , ref@@ using to expand into more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response to human rights organisations was rel@@ ent@@ less .
witnesses testi@@ fied that polic@@ emen were shot dead on ump@@ teen un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
&quot; the videos on the protests , which are probably from the last or early this year , show how security professionals hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the chief of the UN authority for human rights now requires an in @-@ depth investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , head of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorists across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get as much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a resp@@ ectable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissi@@ dents effectively being sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or imprisoned , killed or driven into the desert of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Ethiopia . &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation is prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ eh@@ old with regard to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a large critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea rise ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ liberation front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been imposed more or less in recent years , exploit the turbul@@ ence and re@@ ar@@ ming themselves . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess now explo@@ de under the surface under the surface .
the first one seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave their attention to the protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , which are predominantly Christian high countries from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they explo@@ de the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are going to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and that are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , had until his death in an un@@ published illness in 2012 , 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly sav@@ vy in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively unclear reasons to take Mr Mel@@ es &apos;s position . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the North Ethiop@@ ian Tig@@ ray region , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia experienced such an uph@@ e@@ av@@ al in 2005 after thousands against elections evi@@ den@@ ced , according to analysts apparently ple@@ dged by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , and their measur@@ able progress in poverty allevi@@ ation . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intention of intensi@@ fying the internal mis@@ fortune of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters attacked Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ish city , run by Tig@@ ray and the hate against the tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the U.S. government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flüge over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently claimed that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin tigh@@ tro@@ pe walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains Obama &apos;s statement on IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to disp@@ el the last controversy that surro@@ unds his campaign by attacking that his repeatedly repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication raises new questions about the communication skills of the Repub@@ lican candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings together his comrades who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position that he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the hint at a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump kick@@ ed back in relation to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret , the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , on which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant that the alleg@@ ation was totally serious . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t , Mr. Tr@@ ump , wanted to we@@ aken the statement somewhat by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate did not want to know about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has tried to draw the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan during this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump attempted to return to this subject again .
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he asser@@ ted strong criticism when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , but later he said , &quot; Of course , I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic limits in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans , how they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communications expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump took an even estimated tone as his survey values continued to decline . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ at @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often bl@@ ames his critics to distor@@ ted his statements or mis@@ understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps threw his loy@@ alist opponents into the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements might be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of the most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned about Mr. Tr@@ umps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; in this sense , it is true that before Obama IS an almost unknown , small organization , he called it h@@ amm@@ ers , completely wrong and that &apos;s why it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most Ma@@ instream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in the MS Clinton administration , served as foreign minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out by aggres@@ sively taking control of the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on each of his words and being pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed against him . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ ck@@ oned the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ umps Exc@@ use as mere proof that he was in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
café in Green@@ point returns home once more about the price of the market .
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a legitimate cafe in William@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store were pushed away . &quot;
&quot; soap Ch@@ erie business , made in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; local people smoked it as a last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city . &quot;
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; I know New York is change but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but when New York is change , it is also a re @-@ invention . &quot;
&quot; a busy Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has wi@@ fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafe , the owner and managing director of the new cafe . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered him to provide money for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , survived much . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ nish such as cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions . &quot;
there are natural travel keys .
&quot; the café does not serve beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by William@@ sburg prices , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the club regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb closed , she gave the coffee drink for a while , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was in the coffee and culture in the club that pleased me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal was another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot;
&quot; he went there before the work , and inevitably beg@@ ged the same . &quot;
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a swis@@ s pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing b@@ agel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment , and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot;
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ B@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment on the fact that the soap business took the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go down to her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ point have also accepted the café , too . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he was ahead of putting them out , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice bar wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighboring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was devast@@ ated by the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that the entrance of the restaurant and the bri@@ des felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosevelt had a fai@@ ble for sophisticated delic@@ at@@ essen the Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; the menu on this day was slightly more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and a dessert p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane G@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ E last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the U.S. , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sav@@ our@@ y snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; 54 , ordered a sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable dishes . &quot;
as the repor@@ ter asked Hack@@ heed this was fitting the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; rich food items were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , Leb@@ erk@@ ä@@ se and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ brot . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheaper that the ingredient stre@@ ches .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts as they serve them as a dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at Buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male fields and it was served freshly baked past@@ ries for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; records the roads with which the country was surrounded by no longer being the land of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for Americans was a central , ten@@ se subject , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was equally ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le being a &quot; &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ dues , &quot; &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ man , as coo@@ ks could conc@@ eal un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for many years , became a rarely served luxury . &quot;
strange mix@@ tures were tried because a cal@@ orie rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction appe@@ aled to taste or even whol@@ esome food .
&quot; during their research for the book , which includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from that period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at noon , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the home business recipes .
&quot; as never before , or ever since , driven budget econom@@ ists - among them Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by published prescri@@ ptions and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary politicians &quot; &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a festival of historical delicacies .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa country house cuisine of his kitchen , he spoke as the milli@@ on@@ aire man of the world to which he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cooking as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining @-@ room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully opposed to reality .
&quot; President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake , if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to do an example with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the hired servant with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt led to the fact that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
many of the species from the Great Depression Er@@ a to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country returned to its feet .
&quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; the couple gave the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law better understood , for example , how they could not throw food away . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of waste food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot;
there was the attack of the wind .
&quot; after the plates cleaned up at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e came out of a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , the President Roosevelt enjoyed lunch . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , and added that it was a nasty trick to miss a nice name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ pped something reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the teeth , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E repeated three times a sur@@ fer .
&quot; he said to his wife like a Can @-@ Do @-@ bud@@ get@@ ter , &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
bomb attack killed : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the line to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60,000 people alive . &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own lives on the game to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil protection , which shows him to save an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house in 2014 , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbolic figure in the horror of war .
&quot; but as a hero , he has never seen himself , said lou@@ dly : &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die in saving life , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria . &quot;
&quot; helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrels of barrels above the Al@@ z@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath . &quot;
&quot; we now remove the toxic remains of the bomb , so that no children play with it , &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest ver@@ teb@@ rate is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ ie usually only comes to surface in winter .
&quot; after an investigation , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna . &quot;
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland h@@ arks have only 150 years of offspring .
&quot; the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms down at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches exactly 1,@@ 220 feet on average . &quot;
&quot; only when it matters , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates at about 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; however , this lifestyle em@@ bos@@ sed by slow@@ ness seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal &quot; Science , &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k that could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; mad , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max @-@ Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist predicted long , Greenland ha@@ ie would become stone @-@ old . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland ha@@ ie is hard to watch , finally they live mainly in the polar sea before the spar@@ sely populated coastal waters of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear in winter at the surface . &quot;
researchers do not know little about the Greenland ha@@ ie &apos;s lifestyle .
&quot; her tim@@ el@@ ines stretch to her , when she furnished six animals with a transmitter . &quot;
&quot; this sh@@ arks still make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; they possibly hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the polar ocean and look for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ch from higher water layers . &quot;
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland shar@@ k who took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , whereas the largest 502 centimet@@ ers were measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the lens core of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens appears before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the protein contained therein will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons search for greater quantities of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; the len@@ tic@@ ular nucleus , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons by its length of 220 centimet@@ ers and is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , all larger Greenland ha@@ ie had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lin@@ ens , which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 watch showed a 4@@ 93 @-@ cm long Greenland shar@@ k at an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k might be even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers could assign an age to the length .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland ha@@ ie with the reproduction obviously leaves at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this is also likely to be world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ als live mainly in icy waters is not acci@@ dental .
&quot; the old record holder , a 211 years old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , whose bac@@ on was stuck on the neck a 120 @-@ year old har@@ poon tip , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on spar@@ ring fl@@ ames . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often especially large . &quot;
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal gets heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as soon as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a very large animal should rather invest in a long life . &quot;

&quot; with topics around construction , the council has foc@@ ussed on the latest session . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the panel adopted the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently reported residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the plot , plot and development questions were clari@@ fied and the applications could be placed on survey@@ ing , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) is nothing more interested in interested parties . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the bro@@ o@@ ks in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au appeal to young families and ru@@ sty senior citizens alike .
&quot; as it was said , the volunteers can now report themselves in the town hall , on the awar@@ ding of the plots , the municipal council is expected to be advised in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to also obtain requests to reloc@@ ate further commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the new area of land use in sub @-@ areas only in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ time @-@ lar@@ n area , the park already proved there by two plots in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 is extended . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; accordingly , the City of the Main has the best chances of attracting new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt profits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Compet@@ ence Center for financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether monetary policy can continue to be pursued by London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been admitted to the UK . &quot;
this is why large US banks are taking advantage of this .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .

Gilead acqu@@ ires legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
an US official ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs arising from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead was liber@@ ated by a compensation for damages amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which , in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , were un@@ covered after a U.S. judge un@@ covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct from Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ l and other illegal acts . &quot;
&quot; in case of a complaint on Thursday , US President Beth lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to yield the costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to equi@@ p Gilead to control the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can heal over 90 percent of the patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck claim each other and claims ownership of laboratory work that Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir is underlying , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the United States say they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; troops supported by the United States have rec@@ ap@@ tured full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , a group spokes@@ man on Friday said . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , according to the extract of the remaining group of fighters , buried inside the city , are currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they have freed more than 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stage by fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Rwand@@ an Armed Forces allied with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out clean@@ ers , &quot; he told Reuters . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34,@@ 2 % federal taxes &quot;
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton published her 2015 tax declaration on Friday , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton handled almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ mption ; the former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declarations of the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false pron@@ unciation and reti@@ re@@ es in regards to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; it is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers argued as a reason for his refusal to pass a tax examination by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; noted Clinton &apos;s election campaign assistant Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in terms of the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspec@@ tions were not completed . &quot;
&quot; the critics , among other things , also the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his deal@@ ings and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday , calling on the high ranking Repub@@ lican Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she addressed the topic during a speech about the economy in Michigan . &quot;
he ref@@ uses to do what any other candidate candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; she said to the crowd .
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that , during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump paid no or only very little tax , and a New York Times econom@@ ist quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday that this could still be the case . &quot;
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure that individuals who pay more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in Om@@ aha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka demanded Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat here , to exchange Tr@@ ump to a meeting in order to exchange their tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax examination of IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump was &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; from the voters and not before the tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return until 2007 .
&quot; Clin@@ tons , who are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an average of approximately 32 % effective federal tax rate between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the 2015 tax declaration of 2015 showed that these are just USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main financial investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues of USD 10@@ 9,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der and fire@@ work bodies promote Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der .
&quot; the method has proved effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea years ago , has intensi@@ fied its promotion along with the U.S. natural protection by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many wood@@ p@@ eck@@ ers have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is World Wide Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant in doing so , &quot; said the managing director of Honey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi cloud &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ ff mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end up to the ignition switch is turned . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a knob and spra@@ yed fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der into the air . &quot;
a touch is usually already off to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; a final possibility is a thro@@ wer , which shoots a gold fire@@ work fire@@ works in the air and causes a loud , light explosion . &quot;
city council adopted unanim@@ ously : no Ki@@ os@@ ens@@ ub@@ au at the St. Go@@ ar river Rhine
&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar investment projects of trade @-@ seek@@ ers with K@@ us@@ sh@@ land apply - but the retail trade in the core city is considered to be considerably exp@@ and@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , the town coun@@ cill@@ or rejected the application for the construction of a sal@@ es@@ man at the Rhine near the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the construction of the Rh@@ en@@ ish @-@ Baltic Sea . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of principle , we welcome new business@@ men , but at this location in exposed locations on the Rhine shore this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot;
Jewish director dis@@ assem@@ bles Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots escap@@ es a media eye after revealing that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election , as Arab guests had requested an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel selection list . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries that could be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has been eliminated and eliminated ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to select Israel via its own call centre . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; shock him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was a deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels .
the reason behind it was causing even more rage in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pres@@ election is deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really sham@@ eful .
the fact that this is exactly the same hotel chain in Germany is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a fairly large response on the internet , where people called the whole a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some subordin@@ ate the Kemp@@ inski Hotel to give it to the alleged aff@@ or@@ ations of Arab guests .
&quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; was it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is located near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly rejected all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports The Mir@@ ror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; not to include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
added that the country code now has been added .
police destro@@ ys tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students met with the police in Sao Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reform for the public education system . &quot;
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esters .
&quot; the difficulties began as police officers tried to diver@@ t the students , leading to the fact that the police interven@@ ed rubber floors and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dism@@ ay about the plans .
&quot; according to the suggestions of the governor of the Federal State Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the members of the protest saw gra@@ ff@@ iti@@ ts against the provisional President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place on the streets several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspect President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian enterprises increased strongly in the country , the ambassador informed . &quot;
Russian companies are taking up existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , further commercial exploitation is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade break was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an goes from a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia for this year .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representation provided around 3@@ 5,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses requested : beverage Market in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y raid occurred on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ strasse .
&quot; under the backing of a gun @-@ weapon , three dark @-@ dressed people who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , from the staff of the beverage market demanded the release of cash and then escaped first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW @-@ Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money has been captured , the police do not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,60 and 1.70 m tall , i.e. relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is poor@@ ly observ@@ able .
&quot; after the fall , the perpetr@@ ators must be sc@@ anned towards Ger@@ ber@@ strasse , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel parking place located opposite the Park@@ haus , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
those who have made observations at the time ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y of prey should report urgently to the police .
Nag@@ old : games and fun during summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young@@ sters of the social educational day group / social group work of the child protection federation Nag@@ old with their assist@@ ants at their summer holiday in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet , relaxed atmosphere Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the lively group was quartered in the first school holiday week . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , it went to Bret@@ ten with the visit to the zoo zoo . &quot;
&quot; on the other way to Jews &apos; bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s tour in the world @-@ famous clo@@ ister . &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Celtic museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days , the group was am@@ using at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n who invited to jump , swimming and pl@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers with their self @-@ prepared body@@ guards like the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spoiled . &quot;
&quot; workshops were born , creating beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones or made of wood , a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings on the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of departure , the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned home satisfied . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gateway of Comp@@ as@@ sion
the mini@@ stries from the minister unit E@@ cot@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were met . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next roman@@ ce of all the mini@@ stries in the fores@@ ee@@ able two years , the round of the Ministers of Ministers of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgri@@ m@@ ages were insp@@ ected and finally decided for the Bischof@@ s@@ stadt Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Merc@@ y , the Holy Year of Merc@@ y at Freiburg Cathedral had a special pilgrimage goal . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and holy rooms went their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ m Cross and shared the Pil@@ gri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b it was driven by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster Imm@@ or@@ ist loved one and so the pilgri@@ m route from Münster was started . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were surrounded by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts in the morning and evening . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is at field cross@@ roads , chap@@ els or churches continued to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the overnight stays , there were par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes available . &quot;
&quot; with Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a tasty and stren@@ gh@@ tening dinner and breakfast . &quot;
we went on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; after that , the stage went to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but initially needed some 500 al@@ timet@@ ers to be climbed . &quot;
the deser@@ ved reward was a joint barbecue at the beach in the evening .
after the morning burst on the fourth day of the Pil@@ gri@@ mage in the impressive minster of St. Peter the final stage went to Freiburg .
&quot; the Min@@ is was visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , in the late afternoon at Freiburg Mu@@ enster and passed through the gate of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a little impulse , God was thank@@ ed here . &quot;
the Min@@ is by Ko@@ unding Markus O@@ bert were welcomed at the evening Mass in Münster .
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the city of B@@ reis@@ gau .
&quot; in the afternoon , we went by train to Hor@@ b . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped . &quot;
&quot; cave Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home , as Br@@ ite Gold wins for cycling &quot;
&quot; Scot@@ t@@ lands Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ zed last night in the men team spr@@ int at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor role , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
they repeated the trick after they took place in March at the World Championships in London despite the res@@ ignation of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in time for execution .
&quot; Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement has produced a gap , the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close . &quot;
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots , which now un@@ folds . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner scored an Olympic champion in qualifying laps , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ des fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which one went into a higher gear to slow it up and enable Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert and fell sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der than they got on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make a name .
we have set up an olymp@@ ic board in the final round and the World Champion is defeated .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y &apos;s and Ho@@ ys , he agreed that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track . &quot;
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection of England &apos;s rival .
&quot; with such a superior victory , there was no such problem this time . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; It feels with all the UK flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team over the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the past five months , we expect to be successful five days in the bicycle . &quot;
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
&quot; that would mean Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( an apparently sacred date for the British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - mean a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y will be part of the Sprint race that will start today and will go for three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he won two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were more good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometer race . &quot;
they came in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 at the finish . &quot;
&quot; world record , which won in 2012 in London Gold , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition where Wig@@ gins will focus on safety .
&quot; yesterday , he was cont@@ ested with officials before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will continue and end tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bark@@ er and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB Team relies on his strong web wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to catch a crowd of medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; trage@@ dies played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex@@ ism and muni@@ tions , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; but if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite like the legendary call GB@@ s , which has reached its climax at the perfect moment , will be repeated again . &quot;
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to ann@@ ul@@ ment of the energy consumption question@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the system operator can termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thus lift all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 work@@ places at the Al@@ coa facility in Port@@ land are at stake .
&quot; not less than 2000 work@@ stations - direct , indirect - could be at risk of closure . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the melting shop consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa acquired the Point Henry Mel@@ ting , which led to a closing of Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting furnace with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , indicated that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging operations &quot; , &quot; which should have come into force from November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenues in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on revenues on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong terminal markets for wholesale prices .
&quot; AG@@ L informed that the value of the contracts had already been written down in his annual subscription amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melting shop , or to ensure the power supply to the melting &quot; does not interfere . &quot;
&quot; the US company said it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have come into effect from November this year , even if it is still a declaration of why it has res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn due to the poor economic conditions of the sector prior to the possible closing of the Port@@ land sm@@ elt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of analysts at the start of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mich@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume around 600 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts per year and around 900 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts of electricity per year . &quot;
&quot; if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generating set , that would not be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Clan &apos;s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to cry , &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , a critical reality video that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ( except for the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as well as in the presence of the all @-@ loved show@@ bi@@ z @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends with a classic turn : they all have a surprise party planned . &quot;
&quot; this presents the stere@@ otyp@@ ed action nearly every birthday from a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon squ@@ ad at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls participate in this public@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , security began a new era of car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for her . &quot;
the September issue is the most selling edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracted a large number of advertisers . ( Accor@@ ding to the 8@@ 32 pages of the paper 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover@@ stars is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine had le@@ aked out before the official announcement .
&quot; women , who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there have been more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that model@@ ed &quot; as &quot; Models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar Win@@ ner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ enner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls below the previous category , is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or te@@ ens of today who know how to turn a good snap@@ chat video ( even if this applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with Lem@@ on@@ ade &apos;s release . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone . &quot;
&quot; with its reality TV history , J@@ enny &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised her and called her &quot; &quot; Mist@@ stück des Augen@@ bli@@ cks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these feelings were cooked up again , when the message came out with J@@ enn@@ ers release on the Vo@@ gue cover . &quot;
&quot; but on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut , it seems to pass by at the point . &quot;
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ ming Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters will sell you pictures of yourself on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she was sold to the magazine LOVE by C@@ ind@@ y C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter .
and in her spare time she is to be seen in reality TV . presum@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; municipal Service Centr@@ es aver@@ t 16@@ 0,000 people per year &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary conditions are rejected annually by the community centers , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further aver@@ sions on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , there are already three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no funds for unfair discrimination and similar - in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already fully covered , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , it is expected that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot;
the director of the community centre of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municip@@ ality Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people will be rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only get worse without lifting the decision of the federal government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people from important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with uns@@ ur@@ passed and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been fired by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ just@@ ly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of people in need of Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we urge the General Secretary and the Minister of Justice , as well as sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of community centers and their communities , as well as that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump campaign campaign indic@@ ted after workers allegedly moved weapons
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign has been charged with allegedly in@@ action after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina was directed to an employee in February , while traveling in a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in the State Court of Charlotte , by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ini was waiting for months to have waited for the matter to be settled internally before he realised that &quot; &quot; this would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; drew a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the course in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; Bord@@ ini admitted in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after he compl@@ ained to the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini stated that at least four other persons had already had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; Bord@@ ini admitted . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Repub@@ lican candidate country triggered an uph@@ e@@ av@@ al when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; - gun owners and weapon @-@ friends - should take action if his rival should appoint H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judges . &quot;
it was clear that the media had torn his words out of the context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is Compl@@ aint requires compensation from the campaign for violation of due di@@ ligence and Philip due to bodily injury and lasting mental damage .
&quot; for an opinion , Tr@@ umps Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher@@ in Hope H@@ icks was not to be reached . &quot;
attempts to contact Philip were just as bad .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , announces that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; not responding to calls to its consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; until now , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has conducted a controversial campaign . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before federal elections : lose the SPD and the CD@@ U
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses for the ruling party SPD and CD@@ U are notable . &quot;
this gave representative surveys to the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances to continue the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD r@@ ushed from 35.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : the Nokia Communic@@ ator was launched 20 years ago .
&quot; today , the success@@ ors dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster . &quot;
the tool weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ unk@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory initially amounted to eight Meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would suff@@ ice today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ aby@@ tes .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; occurred exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , fans can still buy the devices on the Internet , but they date back to the age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; but 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier on the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as an &quot; Western media office . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to transmit a lot for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator could be reached . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , albeit slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euro . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; no one could suspect in August 1996 , that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the Smartphone @-@ era . &quot;
&quot; since then , everything has been different . &quot;
&quot; smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the mobile phone division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold and wound up to Microsoft . &quot;
the market today domin@@ ates vendors that all came much later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday life . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; around 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million units sold . &quot;
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole of the industry has emerged around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough for the mass market occurred only in early 2007 , at that time Apple @-@ CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : one music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , everything is easy to use by touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the triumph@@ al march of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the company &apos;s most important product . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the look . &quot;
&quot; she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sag@@ as now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ evident 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German is now looking for 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we must all learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Kugel , responsible for personnel in the Siemens board of management . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and He@@ a@@ throw expand
&quot; He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring renewal and prosperity to our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just like in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities , we will work alone already 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of expanding he@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming at the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any asked question . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for some infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn in real growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and the whole of the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from T@@ 5 to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 that was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented drives in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third running track , which is supported by £ 16 billion on private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time that we direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software producers try to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display lock@@ ings on his desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post that told users that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertisements in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop page would change enco@@ ding with regard to its advertisements in order to detect the indication of which part of the page advertising is adver@@ ti@@ ser . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams writes that &quot; this kind of hard @-@ and @-@ going battle between the an@@ tim@@ ed Open Source Community and the conver@@ ters has already been underway since the invention of display lock@@ ers , and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest enterprise for social media has entered the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying scor@@ ers have become the industry .
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people use display lock@@ ers worldwide , almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; the company has posted it on Desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile apps for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertisement on desktop computers makes a sufficient amount of revenues , so that Facebook is the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; ad prefer@@ ential pool &quot; to keep people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we are planning to address the problem , &quot; commented on Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; advertisers are a bl@@ unt instrument , which is why we have instead focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to get more control over the hands of the people . &quot;
woman in susp@@ ecting susp@@ ens@@ ory suicide on Swiss fre@@ eway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was transferred to a suspected suicide by several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman took refuge in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 passed by several vehicles , including a truck , tried to kill himself . &quot;
she died still locally .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , &quot; divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a collision avo@@ idance ?
&quot; that is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person in the dark ran on the motorway , it was decided that drivers must not assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year a police officer of the neg@@ ligent murder was acqu@@ itted , after having passed a man and killed a man lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became un@@ conscious on the street , took the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the court stated that the polic@@ ew@@ oman , who had responded to an emergency call -- was justified in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Klim@@ am@@ o@@ dell : Venus once lived
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have exposed to similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , d@@ ull atmosphere and nevertheless turned slowly . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably showed more dry regions than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to its day @-@ side of the Sun nearly two months , &quot; &quot; explains G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model emerged a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously thought by planetary researchers .
&quot; although it once was probably hab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billions years -- was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away from the ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gene escaped , there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy returns as coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy stepped back on Thursday as a coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a low co@@ determination right in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as chief trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; expressed the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , needed and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
he must also have a right to take decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick told me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , Roy was the winner of the Jack Adams award as the best coach of the league . &quot;
&quot; he led the association to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten up in the first round of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed the night in each of the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches marked a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .

&quot; the labour struggles for the remun@@ eration for North Sea oil workers will be suspended , while all the parties put themselves at the table for a new round of discussion , said the negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the Wood company Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea conducted by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the present strike , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
we will hold some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will begin early next year to restart the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has shor@@ tened the rates to its tractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s install@@ ment follows a 10 % drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ om@@ ime with the UK energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had increased by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , the Scottish MEP , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the largest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation . &quot;

Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the Ple@@ j@@ aden
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the Ple@@ j@@ aden star enh@@ ancer .
the new data will help astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in star cluster rotate to different rates and in what context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with planetary creation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancements , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood . &quot;
they are now turning faster .
&quot; at top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ top rotation rates , these stri@@ pping stars rep@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; since these winds travel through the mag@@ net@@ osphere of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest indication of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers with bigger stars turning slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; since the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older &quot; , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is much more to us about what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; &quot; dancing shoes &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the summary rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades who will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a Bas@@ eball @-@ Star Tre@@ at
the tears ran up at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional roll@@ out announcement , the 41 year old pro will be wearing the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays for the last time in his New York Y@@ ank@@ ees tri@@ cot . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say Good@@ bye to both , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ times all @-@ star @-@ game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ ank@@ ees . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contrac@@ tion on December 31 , 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
as a player it paid Rodri@@ gu@@ ez for a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 Hits and 2021 Points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he made some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two other bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , in the hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should nevertheless not be accepted . &quot;
&quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nickname &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked for 211 games by the end of 2014 due to a winding in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the chief suspect to have received high @-@ performance funds for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic .
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time . &quot;
even his departure days are not running sil@@ ently .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends play once again on the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails the attempt to win any game , &quot; commented Y@@ ank@@ ees @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the actress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relationships with Pop@@ star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson , received sympathy from the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee Arch@@ riv@@ ale Boston red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the fans at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen x@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a curious ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh race day , the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro are the first official dop@@ ing events . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese float in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter steep@@ le ch@@ ase in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically @-@ under@@ ed athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to the unknown . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ d has been proven , which is used as a m@@ asked agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International International Court of Justice confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old finished fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ fly , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part in the blu@@ epr@@ ints of over 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing applies .
&quot; the national association &quot; &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en &apos;s full co @-@ operation at the investigations , &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International International Court of CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , it is not the IO@@ C but the CAS for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio , the news le@@ aked across the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 year old went on the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she was innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; the ath@@ lete explained . &quot;
&quot; hemp exhibition , museum of natural history Fri@@ bourg , CH &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Probe should also be positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v promptly informed himself with criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the ath@@ lete did not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ poll@@ uted nation may not participate in Rio . &quot;

both argue that they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
&quot; before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa was a further serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Federation had banned the entire Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing , even the nation nation of Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the swimming @-@ sports , the earlier off@@ ences in China also caused hef@@ ty con@@ front@@ ations between the athletes . &quot;
so the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Yang hard .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ ly purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle I want to pass , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the centre of a confrontation with Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Sun was positively tested for the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ one in the Chinese champ@@ ionships , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
dat@@ kl@@ au : as per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ ackers comp@@ ress their ran@@ som
programmers from black@@ mailing have currently access companies - and they are successful .

40 per cent of the victims had will@@ ingly paid the ran@@ som required by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in company networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to black@@ mail ran@@ som is much higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ cau@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski talking to the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in recent months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , she is searching for recently changed files like Word@@ - , Excel or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; after that , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the end key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private users are the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt business operations , in a case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany already several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients can be acute threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always tell the victims : pay not , it only encourages the problem , &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
the h@@ ackers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety investig@@ ators of F @-@ Secure have examined the user interfaces and the contact with black@@ mail and come to the result : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build a kind of customer service in order to earn more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ code for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and if private individuals are rede@@ emed after payments of only a few hundred euros , companies must negotiate a hard time and pay five dig@@ its to get back their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the Ran@@ som@@ ware solution , the h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the previous malware kits have been created by making the malware available for themselves , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the black@@ outs are looking for further h@@ ackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
&quot; so you log@@ ist in one of the boards on the ground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per infected machine .
&quot; usually the criminals then deleg@@ ate sp@@ amm@@ ers with the dis@@ sem@@ ination , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better safeguard their data .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful growth , the perpetr@@ ators are threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price sc@@ aling , &quot; explains Mal@@ cau@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the damage potential , depending on the type of data , is still much higher than before . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; at the &quot; &quot; Hack@@ er@@ konferenz &quot; , &quot; security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory rather than heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack all : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pé and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the HR @-@ V is very small only 1.@@ 60 m , the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the rear . &quot;
&quot; the interior materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cock@@ pit top side drops out . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage space .
&quot; it is not only a boot space of 45@@ 3 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l with revers@@ ed back@@ rests available , but there is the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less mag@@ ically , than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like chin chairs and thus offer storage space , which is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , he should make his work somewhat qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot;
but steering seems to be a bit more direct .
&quot; in the tested top version &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; , &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the security systems are part of the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane assist system . &quot;
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the remote @-@ beam assistant is very reliable .
and the intelligent Tem@@ por@@ eg@@ ler respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tle when necessary the speed .
&quot; however , full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI Connec@@ tors are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive petrol from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the motors meet the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
airline is not responsible : down@@ fall on passenger lift
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger lift .
&quot; because a liability is conceivable only with danger which are typical of aviation , the Higher Regional Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued . &quot;
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a bend in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline didn &apos;t have to pay any damages to the man .
disease : when to pay the organis@@ er
&quot; after their journey , dise@@ ased vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back when the cause of the disease is to be found without doubt in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than 10 per cent of the guests demonstrated the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the trial , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ mo@@ il holiday . &quot;
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their illness returned the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a faul@@ ty sewage treatment which supposedly contam@@ inate the sea@@ water .
the family thought that the trip was defici@@ ent - and compl@@ ained about the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
&quot; in fact , the sewage treatment was indeed defective . &quot;
but the organizer first learned about this before leaving the plain@@ ti@@ ff .
&quot; until then , he had to assume that the sea water was fine . &quot;
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his information obligations , so the verdict . &quot;
&quot; particularly as in the samples of water , no im@@ pur@@ ities were found . &quot;
the condition of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of living .
from 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ran@@ ged .
&quot; after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the state must act decis@@ i@@ vely and decis@@ i@@ vely on terror . &quot;
surely our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division .
we won &apos;t allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders have to leave the country faster , this increase the security and strength also the consent of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to implement the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; he also announced another personnel rein@@ forcement of the security forces , namely &quot; in a medium @-@ sized order of magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be pun@@ is@@ hable again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
the last much deb@@ ated sec@@ rec@@ y of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians should be maintained according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the threat of the citizens can be reduced , he said with a glance about psych@@ ical ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister holds a better social support necessary . &quot;
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ ati@@ sed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of conce@@ aled investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which helps to increase security further . &quot;
&quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior , clearly opposed to stock@@ hol@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; this was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said to the papers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abo@@ lition of double citizenship previously .
he considers a general prohibition of full @-@ wear to be un@@ constitutional .
&quot; you can &apos;t for@@ bid everything one re@@ jects , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green Chief Simone Peter designed the Minister for simul@@ ating action and action with ever @-@ changing anti @-@ terror par@@ c@@ els .
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ x@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Pro@@ verbs and a sharp@@ ening of the right to stay bring people no more safety in this country . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway zu@@ b@@ inger
here is a picture of November .
but this should change : the regulation of law should be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the ambient road every evening in the traffic jam if they are driving over the motorway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
&quot; on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , the road construction company extended the legal distance lane by 700 meters ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and Wes@@ eler Straße . &quot;
drivers can then direct from the Hammer street to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic is split early , whereby the total procedure is improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea , with the extended exit , had the CD@@ U faction in the district &apos;s dep@@ op@@ ulated Münster @-@ West . &quot;
the road nar@@ rowing on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nervous the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the way back to the bridge across the Alber@@ go way and sometimes beyond . &quot;
the reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is only guided via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second trail had to be built back a good one @-@ three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge does not have the necessary hydro@@ power , in order to take the heavy @-@ duty traffic two @-@ lane . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated plant @-@ daily traffic will continue , the competent regional company cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to reck@@ on : because the bridge has an official remaining period of rest until 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal ab@@ bi@@ quity of the law , the state has deliberately chosen the more moderate amount of time during the school holidays because it can be expected with disabilities . &quot;
the traffic is passed on Tuesday and on Wednesday by a lane by the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the Theater@@ stück &quot; Das Un@@ seen Haus . &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young theatre are now planning a musical project .
N@@ ima &apos;s Association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has attended a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible House &quot; of the Young The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; initiated by the N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel , &quot; 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 visited the production in the Small House . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcoming classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; most young@@ sters of the class have come from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and we@@ aken little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , such as the press release of the Young The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg , the Association N@@ ima &apos;s , and the young theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , teenagers with and without fluid and migration background should be able to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dancing , acting and music . &quot;
children and families in the field of theat@@ rical play and theat@@ rical language mediation are in the planning stage .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association reck@@ ons with many classes that want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement
the weather has turned the star @-@ schn@@ au@@ zer Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany on the night to Friday a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle , said the chair of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ scales are per@@ sei@@ den , which are one of the fastest shooting stars at the age of 216@@ ,000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening , one walks around for a long time ; at night , one is awake for hours , in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep in the morning before the wake @-@ up ring . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how are sleeping problems or sleep disorders ?
&quot; there are several types of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes underlying them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ emia , member of the board member of the German Society for sleep and sleep medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands inland , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , i.e. a disturb@@ ance and sleep disturb@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the Durch@@ gehen means many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagner &apos;s ne@@ cht , member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors can be identified , but also medicines . &quot;
in@@ frequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early awakening is especially common in case of depression , &quot; says We@@ emia . &quot;
and it can be that different factors are mutually dependent .
&quot; for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can lie badly , wake up every two or three hours , and possibly start to pon@@ der about everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should I go to a doctor with sleep disorders ?
&quot; if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is com@@ promised a day , should go to the doctor , advis@@ es We@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; impair@@ ment can look quite differently : one is beaten , tired , exhausted , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to rel@@ ieve the sleep disturb@@ ance , it is important to find out the causes . &quot;
&quot; the treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , it is hard to find quiet sleeping medi@@ ators , empha@@ sizes Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Sle@@ ep@@ ort of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , you should first contact the family doctor if you have sleeping problems . &quot;
it can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to the sleep laboratory , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; in order to study in the sleep laboratory , physicians will advise for example snor@@ ing with respiratory dro@@ ppers , for sickness @-@ free day fatigue , sleep @-@ chang@@ ers , or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disturb@@ ance , Fi@@ ba@@ que explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ ba@@ que . &quot;
&quot; after cl@@ adding , one goes to bed at a normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nas@@ al glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler right at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera draws on the ceiling to sleep . &quot;
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of scre@@ wing prop@@ ellers on which to put a better sleep .

what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to be
the former German float Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing sli@@ pping of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ i .
&quot; in December 2014 , he made gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time placed his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has been protective in front of his ex te@@ amm@@ ates standing in the review . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner receives 20.000 € award and a jungle team of 150,000 € should no one be surprised by missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot;
&quot; the conveying system in the swimming @-@ sport is bad , while the dop@@ ing controls on the other hand are very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at the topic of dop@@ ing , or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not saying that the controls should be set here , &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be registered for nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .

airport : ban@@ de from Bag@@ gage Al@@ lowed
professional th@@ iev@@ es at Düsseldorf Airport
police officers of the Düsseldorf police succeeded on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ects had report@@ edly committed several hand@@ bags and luggage racks as a band .
&quot; at 9 : 30 p.m. civilian officials in the area of the airport Dus@@ sel@@ dorf recognized a gang , which was known to the police officers from past theft del@@ usions . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ici@@ des since the middle of July and were very professional , working rigi@@ dly and especially professionally . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the C@@ ID Committee 34 can demonstrate four actions to the th@@ iev@@ es , which had been specially sent to carry out criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; the R@@ ī@@ ga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in doesn &apos;t look like that , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walking along the road from east to west , one passes through play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade . &quot;
someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house .
&quot; opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is to be dem@@ ol@@ ished soon , it is already built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , however , in recent weeks preferred to be illustrated with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have le@@ ased contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator H@@ enkel recorded several times for a hard action of the police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Ca@@ det s@@ mi@@ ths , had been cleared by 300 police officers , police pat@@ rolled three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , blocked off parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; during the meantime , the building workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers pulled off the che@@ ers of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain early Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are located . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ wing force is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who is raising three children here , is mainly generated by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the house projects , they share the concern of increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , which caused several local police protection from the v@@ andal@@ ous left . &quot;
&quot; the tr@@ ench , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police establish between house owners and their neighbors , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , even today compared to the rest of the city , a low average income and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 many houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street near Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was swe@@ pt under a large police force in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the R@@ ī@@ ga and partly inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in recent years , the borough has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and constitu@@ ents from all over the world : now residents of GDR times and former home occup@@ ants share their neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
many of the new@@ buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them on designed discs or newly painted fac@@ ades that were fired with colour bags .
no other street was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason for not all neighbours to regard this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : crimes such as bodily harm , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against police officers . &quot;
&quot; most of the criminal off@@ ences make damage to property , which tends to hit the newly built houses and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ancy house next to the disputed 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is wei@@ ght@@ less : the people in 94 are their neighbours , they have not been determined . &quot;
the famous burning cars are no longer available in the R@@ ī@@ ga anymore .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved into the R@@ ī@@ ga Street .
&quot; this is why it was so important that the residents get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted new buildings in former construction gaps that displ@@ ace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in the end , these are con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - there are more people who are not so well drunk , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not appro@@ ve . &quot;
but what should one do if someone never li@@ stens to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for tra@@ iled ones who are angry about color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the building projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
those who are moving should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub district to complain about noise there .
all persons presented only with first names have asked to not be called by their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee agent
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee agent for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of administration for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , migrant workers , administration , authorities and who else is involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customers from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the cutting edge of wool , which above all has a problem . &quot;
&quot; for example , some - less spot@@ ting than the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; searching for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , was a cutting edge of wool . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports both honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are big and minor problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
new containers are soon available in the W@@ as@@ enstraße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been acknowledged .
&quot; for the connection provision , the municipalities are responsible . &quot;
they must submit the refugees in their own or rented premises .
&quot; the costs for building , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the coun@@ cill@@ or to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; in fact , administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it did not work , so you may rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the apartments must be repaired as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are placed in the W@@ as@@ enstraße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customers and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a solid lead , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and support activities for refugees and migrants who have to be ti@@ led or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house master@@ ing , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that working for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
this is &apos; no employment therapy &apos; .
&quot; however , activity does not only mean labour . &quot;
&quot; the day requires a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and volunteers are jumping .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain to the refugees that it takes just and they can make sense to bridge the time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help nobody in Ur@@ bach , don &apos;t want to work and be useless , he will never integrate . &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; but there are problems , too , says customer honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : have the two after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces afraid of radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite plain@@ ly , &quot; what a person may call na@@ ï@@ ve . &quot; but a residual risk cannot and does not want to exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents also include the issue of refugees .
they would be afraid that the assass@@ ins will bring them up completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so major and local volunteers must look for activities locally and in the region .
they have always in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants would soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics abh@@ ors itself . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to spot them on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sh@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot;
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher are already busy trying to integrate the previous people sensi@@ bly .
&quot; this is currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they have to help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : looking for a helicopter with helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - without success .
two unknown men are forc@@ efully forced into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house at 8.@@ 50 a.m. on Friday morning .
the vill@@ agers surprised the two and stroke the cl@@ ums@@ y .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.70 m tall , probably m@@ asked , wearing both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ die pul@@ lis . &quot;
they escaped towards the city centre .
the police interven@@ ed in flag@@ ging a police helicopter and police helicopter .
the flag@@ ging proce@@ eded without success .
perhaps the unknown were indeed falling close to the apartment or their flight .
