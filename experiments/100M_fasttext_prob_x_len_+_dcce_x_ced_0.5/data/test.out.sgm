<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little variation on the beach with some colleagues."</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden" Sportpyramid "for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they drove home to the feed troughs in fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And therewith the equestrian career then ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany was the best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he let himself be led with his family about the plant of ALRV, on a horse he could not even have a photo."</seg>
<seg id="12">"long was the first time in Aachen, and thus also at the CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport assistant was handed over to the man of Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sport Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">Honours do not lack the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"black Lorbeerblade, Silver Lorbeerblade, Champions-Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already invited him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th laureate of the sports pyramid is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, on Saturday, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," "says Langer," "for she is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the" Hall of Fame of German Sports. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the skipping horse Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumum the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and umps policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are in favour of tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are basic, rather philosophical distinctions."</seg>
<seg id="5">About the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in case of doubt, Trump does not want to keep it small in doubt, and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to denounce the economy and regulate it to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively go back to regulation, and he is making a massive tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, states that the state has certain tasks to perform, he has to open disadvantaged chances and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to invest, Trump and Clinton are almost wordless."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate cancels the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly denied by the state-capitalist Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"on Trump, there could be partial internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump will build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, and he wants to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"on the other hand, Clinton wants to extend and demand renewables with its investment programme:" "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two rivals are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazious trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the United States from international trade, but simply better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be paid better, says Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump does to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to rage, then he says he cannot be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point out that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other side Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence is a part of women who are fleeing themselves, almost everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at least one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He is looking curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother gazes at the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the area manager of Condrobs, a vehicle for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the Munich North, they live in one of the few decentralised homes for single-wing women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs created the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich relief agency."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - even not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her run," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically, because torture or death threaten or because their families send them as hopeful carriers to Europe," she tells. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"women outweigh other reasons for their escape:" "many steal away secretly, because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forcible, honourable morals, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">It drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugboats require a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, are mistaken, says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee women would often be considered inferior and misused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are used to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they do not dare to talk openly about the experienced, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often do not know how to help, more accommodations need only for them, requests Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the question of whether they would benefit from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in accommodation of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabia alone, fled women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower Saxony and Lower Franconia, there are storeys or their own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodation exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the Committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is missing or both men and women are accommodated together, there can be - perpetual violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"especially the washrooms should be separate, and for women easily accessible, is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">How much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush that there is at the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we have been talking about it, we have a long waiting list," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily make a second home.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistants have called their union to approve new labour camps in their dispute regarding a new treaty.</seg>

<seg id="4">JDC said that ministers failed to address the concerns of the treaty.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistants and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the President of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was" persistently calm "to problems, which led to the fact that the Treaty was rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "In consideration of this, the JDC Committee has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and requested official renegotiations to all your worries."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in response to the silence of the government, the JDC Committee today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council, in order to approve an ongoing programme of escalating work campaigns that begin at the beginning of September."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture which ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey arrived on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin perceives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg palace, I cannot forbid the impression that Ankara will most want to reconcile this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile appeared evoked and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly about his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but could even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper reported that Erdogan was so dazed as if there had never been anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">"for me, his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the downfall of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara to fall into the backs of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the offence was even greater, since it was committed by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the confidence will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media launched a sharp, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting was held only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire lie clearly on the hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">"first and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after spending the last month at a failed coup d" état of almost his office. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks against Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They are counting on a late-night onslaught on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television projected cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed once again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti presented it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is furious to the West, since it's reaction to the attempted power takeover is regarded as a weak response."</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the continued resentment on the snail empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin is the pike to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey's relationship to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that after the attempted coup d" état, he called for support for the elected state organs. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, a matter of course which itself has a deep fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent an" "alliance of outsiders" ": two countries that violate themselves from the West and feel badly treated and now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial discussions, both presidents at the press conference said they did not even seize the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately mised it to answer a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned State University of Moscow for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it means (in Russian) that he later was the head of the protocol and chief of the government."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said to Putin about his appointment:" "thank you for your confidence." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and Vaino recommended as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest confidanes Vladimir Putin and worked as he was for the Soviet secret services, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, broadcasted on TV, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the ridiculing of the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official assertion - that a man who once was prized as a potential president, suddenly wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," It is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - arduous posts for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin a former member of the State Security Service (KGB).</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin reached power he named Ivanov as one of five people, whom he trusted the most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, since a third term of office would have violated Putin's constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry cross dressings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "ceiling blower", "which approach the completion for each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the construction stage of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slant ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economist Keith Brown attended a visit to the building site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry Crossings. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses to an engineering art from a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the sealing between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the total deck decks at their place and the last section of the deck gets a Betonguss for the deck today, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said:" the first closure presents a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this fantastic project, the closure is forward-looking high-performance and civil engineering."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the North turmdeck, which is under construction, we had to close the gap to the north or the country side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by dragging the northern lift bridge 700 millimetres to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, as the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards by a slope of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"because the tolerances that the team worked, were tiny - on each side they only rusted a few millimeters."</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens mean that investors should be put into duty much more strongly in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to bad news that Brunswick will lose almost 1300 budget apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD is proposing a" "living concept" "for the next council meeting."</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first and foremost, it is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A scheme is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"said vice-president Christoph Bratmann:" "we agree with the Greens: if you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all homes will have to be considered social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the cheap apartments, however, can also arise in the continuance."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big issue in the town hall is, as Bratmann:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing construction programme, which will cost millions of dollars and must still be financed, shall provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, such as Bratmann:" there is currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite this, so Bratmann, banners a sharpening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the program is not yet complete: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do you compare the loss of another 1,300 inexpensive dwellings, whose promotion will expire in the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, so the budgetary spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased intermittent bindings from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into the price fixing."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">For in the west-city run at the end of the season.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some 1800 apartments could be found there back in price fixing for affordable apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: this does not want the owners, the apartment building companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically, it is removed from the goal of the so-called mixing."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no concentration of social weak in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect there to be movement in the discussion.</seg>

<seg id="2">It's fascinating to watch the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children don't go outside to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time spending on screens, has been sued by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later they created a series of animation, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as many phenomena of pop culture dropped the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand, which overburdened the servers."</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon go has more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokemon that can be tracked with a GPS and once they were found," photographed "(using a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person sets back every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, announced the Washington Post recently that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of followed people who exercise 30 minutes each day, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for the health that people want to take" "take 30 minutes" "to" "come from the sofa" "and" "get active every day" "because many public messages to health are boring and coming from people looking to look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="19">"who regularly drives sports, reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that they are fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also mindless players who always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has got a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be repeated over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world and help many people hunting, more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="9">And now also Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast died on Thursday as a multi-campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">"her total result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medallists and" Final Five "team champion Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina."</seg>

<seg id="13">"Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-campaign title and altogether the fifth, while she solidifies her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment ended.</seg>
<seg id="15">"she puts this success in the same league as Michael Phelps, who brought her sports to new heights:"</seg>
<seg id="16">"Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals, which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said she is" the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"she expected her last examination in Brazil, a competition which was not so much between her and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered as disappointment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the individual competition of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Biljana repeated the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark on the farewell party of the crew-ordinator Martha Karolyi."</seg>
<seg id="21">"although Biles insisted that during their long journey to the top, never to have planned the future, this is not really true."</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of her floor exercises - which includes her typical Tumbling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not accidental.</seg>

<seg id="25">"since the summer of 2013, it has lost no competition competition, a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes."</seg>

<seg id="29">"Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her grandson - a pure formality - and tears flowed into billowing red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to a Tiebrake at Mustafina."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time the 22-year-old team captain, who is called Oma by the Americans, had a lead."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said."</seg>

<seg id="9">"in the south of Alabama, a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it was still raining in the Mobile area."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the river COMITE near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will probably reach record levels across the weekend."</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburb regions near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he also said that a river-downward flooding in Ascension Parish represents a danger, as these rivers only slowly flow into the Lake Maurepas."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the river Ticketw, south of the Mississippi State Border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level already at 09.00 on Friday, which was ever recorded."</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still emailed people from the flood water in the districts Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Hansford, 62, says that water of Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, increased greatly overnight."</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another step-in-step who lives near him would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"we woke up and poured in the water," "said Hansford."</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">"his wife, Hansford, said they had never seen such a flood of the river in the 48 years they lived there."</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Hansford said that emergency helpers had rescued all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were lodged until Friday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Krautmann said that the floods were spreading rapidly, as there were still serious rainfalls and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions."</seg>
<seg id="24">"according to Krautmann, an observer was reported near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain."</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the ground was considerably sucked by the rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that heavy rainfalls and road floods caused the rescue of inhabitants of their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and lesson in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS-subsidiary WWL reported that a co-ordinate in Tangipahoa 200 flooded houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches that now both were flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the leader of the community of Robby Miller, said that the authorities would have saved 72 persons and seven pets, which were washed up by the floods."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuation."</seg>
<seg id="31">"as soon as the water starts to go back, they will return to their homes again," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"in the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen roads were closed because of flood water and provided sandbags for the residents to take part, hoping to keep the water out of their houses and stores."</seg>
<seg id="33">"the last great flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration. "</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to be a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison Countys said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast."</seg>
<seg id="36">"according to his statements, a handful of houses had been reported as flooded on Thursday, but no announced on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I presume under the Women's Olympics in the Turns and for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second: this team has three gymnoses, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie" Laurie "Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin color."</seg>

<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American."</seg>
<seg id="9">"last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2."</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas had a surprising Olympiagewchinin and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they expected unexpected but masterful gymnastics routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual competition event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but we don't see gymnastics in the whole country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" Last Five, "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that gymnastics are a costly sport and gymnast primarily in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who are maintained for training, orientation, travel and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnclubs are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the Turner receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer by Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer by Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes, since they started with the gymnast."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to give the churches a myriad, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-access exercise."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my Turnfoundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness culture lets voters bloom in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year for the dismissal of a government report due to corruption removed from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political Correctness has led to knowingly ignoring widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities such as a annihilating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, verbally attacks the police, election observers and Town Hall officials for ignoring evidence of election misuse due to" "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, which is now an anti-corruption treaty, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motifs would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set shut-off bands outside of election cabs to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "he recommends that voters should have a passport to prove their identity in elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter must only name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes to apply non-removable inks to a person's finger, when they release their vote to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this is not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and finance culture associated with it," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's elective scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special electoral court ruled that the acting mayor Luton Rahman was to be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in cynical fashion" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman said" "his campaign is based on the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He spoke in particular alarming to the fraudulent briefing - where the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, illustrated, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the guiding of ways to prove the identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it says:" as proof, pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerted, especially women and young people in order to vote in accordance with the will of the elders, in particular communities with Pakistanical or Bangladesish background. "</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behaviour on the basis of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric addressed 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the prohibition that political activists edit correspondence documents in order to stop" harvesting. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the election directory to be used for immigration and social fraud purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider choosing Choose before choosing for your identification.</seg>
<seg id="25">Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone to choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic review of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are indiscriminate.</seg>
<seg id="27">A 3-year limitation on applications to an automatic letter selection.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists edit complete correspondence and envelopes of correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police give the authority to set up lockouts for polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A legislative change facilitated a charge for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Representation of the People Act 1983.</seg>
<seg id="31">Photographer prohibition in elective stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the elective stations (except for Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees generally assert that voters are alone in the electoral cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishing" that after the Tower Hamlets case no complaint was placed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the Electoral Court ruled Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unsuitable," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he also criticises the ineffective" "check-out controls" "of the constitutions of the Town Hall."</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of the parliaments, but the worrying and hidden spread of election fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you are approaching from front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the spout for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"when you approach you from behind, then you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and go out of the firing line," says Mizrachi. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting his face with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"hit him with your knees in the bar and turn, while the attacker bowed before pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the barrel and move backwards while they set the weapon on it."</seg>
<seg id="8">"with attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, grab the weapon and turn it away so that the attacker cannot shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun from its grip, before moving backwards and set the weapon on it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright shabt his tongue for a guide to the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller subtracted his immune system and strangenginity to a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk abstained his course on a euro note, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a flush of a tener toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before removing each object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to let."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to lick off the sink of a towing toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately nothing left what he leaked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestine, travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public railings to railway stations to sinks of toilets, the task placed its immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told me:" as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was righteous in any case."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample painting showed a luminometric number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometre number is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick after their luminosity rate was over 4000 units, while newly washed hands have one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Wright and Finnish producer of dairy products valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," That comes close to the worst that I have stolen in a toilet. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirtier than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I will not lick here, because it is disgusting here inside."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.</seg>

<seg id="25">We led crazy brainstorming that ended that we said "Let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the director of the film, added:" let me tell me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had made some of the things I need to lick it, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to attach Ian to lick them and others where it was quite difficult."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asoziale family left her social apartment after a delogging with a loss of £50,000, because she had terrorized her neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebucock were thrown into Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked residents of the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"walls pointed claffling holes, wooden boards were torn, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family was resettled and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who worked for Housing in Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer available."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think that people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is too.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had joined, street fights with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screams, strikers and curses included."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skelby, 47 whose name was on the lease, received an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house that will be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate, where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden boards were torn up"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and had to call the police regularly</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing gathered her and her partners forcibly by the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogation was cheered by lightened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," They didn't care for anyone. ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived twenty years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning, we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally away, it will become beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have failed to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house, to which the police was established at regular intervals, for 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the outgrown side of the community house, rubbish and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the renter agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family as a delogation is always the last step considering the Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogation on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers in the house administration will now have to seagrass garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Skelby received a fine, after she pleaded guilty to the possession of a drug of Class B in commercial foresight."</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after they were without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the rooms of the house were graffiti covered.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police said they will be delaying tenants who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">"Angela Crow from the Devon and Cornwall police informed that delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants, who do not stick to the house rules."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproaches, as well as those who have been harmed by such a behavior," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"the Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities."</seg>

<seg id="5">"due to the harsh action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>

<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the election and the last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign close to the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU-coalition, must fear his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains in the end Koalitiondust left.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his large posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the country, distributes roses and chatted a little with the people, as well as his legendary and eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff did."</seg>

<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority in other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m., there are everywhere praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything quite jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet gas station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>

<seg id="7">"the construction site was scheduled to be transferred to the south at the yearly beginning, until the end of October all will be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the reward is also the receipt of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of makeshift transfers."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the building site has been migrated to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the place has eased."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen to the B 27 on both sides.</seg>

<seg id="12">"there were some cases of considerable discomfort," says the Vice President Florian King for the technical management of the refurbishment. "</seg>

<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not maintained, the municipality called for the measuring car from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable transgressions," "says King, who made herself aware of the situation himself."</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been flashed.</seg>

<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales brooks, everyone lets you see."</seg>

<seg id="25">"even at the dealership of Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "most slight drop", "but admits that of course" "the mileage is missing." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Solitary men of middle-aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you rush to the comment section to oversee it under the pseudonym" "NonAllemanymen's Middle Ages" "with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the much-spoken revival of vinyl records is not to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to a mid-life nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all forecasts up to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers maintain their emotions rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit."</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill out the buildings where once independent sellers had been resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specials."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to judge their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to Reckless Records (Number of records: two young women, three men of middle-aged) into Reckless Records (Number of records: eight middle aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and walks through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy items that he sold when he was young and ready."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70's that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably were too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink too much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25 who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers, whom he meets, apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media-pub, people who have heard about the comeback and set themselves to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to followers of the record auditing of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that plate business offers a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers took the impetus to contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some board fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of trusted record covers, from objects that call up happy Jugenderinnerungen."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is a collector so I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to concern yourself spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "instills a staff of a pile of panels."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people, who bought a record last month, have not yet listened to."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record not have record players."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried, while I was puzzled by a pile of Bossa nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (quantity: three middle aged males), has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here and said," "I don't own record players but I'd like to buy a Radiohead disc so that I can put them on the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-based, less musically."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who only slowly enter."</seg>
<seg id="44">"pitstop, which has dedicated the vinyl records almost a whole story, has a blower audience when I enter."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle aged teenagers."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer- and sexpacked pop rather than experimental jazz drilled out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks strange, but nagging mental traumas are hard to set if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She is more like a shopping spree than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not earn much, therefore collecting panels is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..." it drives off with a dearest sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of board lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I pretend to sample the jeans hot pants, I watch a group of young girls who sit around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"the left is a staircase, a wall full of boards from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"however, considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and board enthusiasts who exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they do not spend their Thursday morning with certainty not to wander through record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates while looking at the staring view of an uncanny, 30-year-old false Moderator who raises nothing of middle-aged men's shoulders above the shoulders."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French Court rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais claimed that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary transactions in which people sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, selling hairdressing services or selling tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported unions and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in addition, the provisional businesses and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of Calais prefecture are absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feed people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the precipice was the Jungle Book Kids" Café of the camp, which is non-serving and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people have signed the petition to protect the kids' café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it meant closure" "for those children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two help organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants rated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - following a sharp increase in new arrivals over the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at 7-er rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji issued a masterclass in handling, side stepping, back up, line-up and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Bok, 7-5 in semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of that, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it might be a consolation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang around his neck: Fijis head trainer Ben Ryan, the former chief of England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this flap will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and allowed the GBs to blast it out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in running buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 upwards, as Osea Kolinisau drowned in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with just four minutes playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned around."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a tougher crackle from Mitchell stopped the Berg of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute lete jaza Veremalua in the right corner a touch down and there was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the reintroduction and there was still a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressured by further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still missing."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB introduced basic changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua ran through Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an experiment for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South Pacific, whose fans cheered, flags and danced on the tribune."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">"the whistle rang, the Fijis embraced themselves and GB kicked annihilated in the grass."</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a scarce semi-finals match from the race - Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Kyle Brown drove the boat in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the posts in the second half."</seg>
<seg id="30">"a brilliant late Tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team ensured the win - and thus the silver medal."</seg>

<seg id="2">"there will be no more remote gold than in these games, and that will mean something."</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first rudder to last, 220 hard sieves enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning invented an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even if there were only those who sat on the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was omnipresent when they rowed the second olympic old in the history of British sports, who put such a yardstick."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolutely, after all their 39,ter was undefeated, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the way of triumph."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind each of the gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental progress that could make the difference, and nobody knew that he would survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he risked."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that did it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was fortunate that he was able to start treatment in early 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right concept in such circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to get better soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing on itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even greater."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts came to Williams who spent a nerve-rising morning to talk more than usual and tried to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"panning, who was the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said," "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's maybe a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it only repeats how much to me this means, how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning did not lose a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were not able to keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen cried," "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">"today we didn't want fireworks, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover needs to appear next week on a wedding, your own with the TV adventure Steve Backshall. "</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in London, it took about six months to conceive that I am an Olympic champion."</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>

<seg id="2">"the managing director of the" Veitenstein Group, "Ruppert Göller, retired."</seg>
<seg id="3">The association is regarded as "Bavarian far exemplary."</seg>
<seg id="4">A small Franconian drinking water-purpose association as a model for the large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This meant some time ago in the original one in a contribution by Bayerischen Rundfunks.</seg>

<seg id="14">"his duties have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organization work, the budgetary plan, calculation of fees and contributions to emergencies on weekends," said the chairman. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"as an outstanding event, it called the start-up and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and for the rehabilitation of the high vessels (1999), the new creation of a central computer control (2004) and the partial reconstructions of water pipes."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was no standstill and there was always new additions, because water lives and drinking water is the most important food."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in their laudatio, she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years."</seg>
<seg id="18">"he has spent himself with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association, and he has lived the water-purpose association quite literally as if it were his own company."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group for nitrate reductions before the water forum of the Lower Franconia area."</seg>
<seg id="20">"for that, he received a lot of recognition and praise."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Rupert Göller, on his part, praised Wasserwart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Ursel Kipp has accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in the teacher's studies she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and lively, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, Erhard Hackler tells of the German seniors division."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular merging, seniors can socialize and foster social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"often social and family structures dissolve in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to arrange oneself and organise oneself on the other and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense.</seg>

<seg id="15">"on older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of the Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, the common singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening of songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"by lyrics and especially melodies, the person suffering from dementia causes long past events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head is also required to perform special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm, and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"just elderly people, who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I am doing something for a long time, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try out a new hobby doesn't hesitate, even if he means having little talent, advises Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who listens to you when a sound comes next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in the search for the right offer, senior citizens have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in an ecclesiastical choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help with internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"anyone who wants to sing should join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or World Records are not always deterred by the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>

<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte was subsequently transformed into a viral internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old finished his course for 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not sporty character that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special startright from the international swimming pool.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in the presented countries better known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"because in Ethopia most sportsmen run, Habte wanted to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first nicknames quickly made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media called him the "rouble of the whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"based on a" well-being bump, "the English tabloid" The Sun "with" Dad Bod "made fun of him."</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he beat about 100 m Freestyle with a minute and almost five seconds, played no part."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani ensured media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a run over 100 m of Freestyle alone."</seg>
<seg id="21">"frenetically, Moussambani was fired at that time."</seg>
<seg id="22">The then 22-year-old learned to swim eight months before the Olympic Games and had never taken such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filtering tool, Snapchat enables some 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that is already bordered to absurdity."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are unfamiliar, self-propelled tools that generate more than 30 million new selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All deviations get to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were charged that the App Blackface would promote or propagate white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week gave some users a filter, which gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and evaporated cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon by Asians -" Yellow-face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversy had shown a larger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and outrage were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was meant as an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of vulnerable clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others declined the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an email, Grace Sparapani wrote a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widespread over the photos that the filter was" vulnerable and "said to the least unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with contrasting a very reluctant Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face was dragged into the depreciating extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wire.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">"and Snapchats big audience of young people, who are more versed in the breed than their older opponents - could expect to expect sensitivity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"if one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is insulting for a user," it's much more difficult that such things stay unnoticed than it was earlier, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">She said she said that racial-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat integration practices.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticized the large part of white, only male leadership, and ended up with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," "said the Chinese-American Zhu," "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable in order to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely ignored the Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its staff, but according to a speaker, the company recently set up a human resource manager, focusing on subordinate population groups and on internal integration efforts."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for her part, Zhu said she will be closed to her Snapchat account and added," I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K.. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence services to record an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions on the ground had allowed, an inquiry committee of the congress reported in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"preliminary report, created by a task force of the Republican Members of the Armed Forces, Intelligence Committee and the Military Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command secret service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, just Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence services typically kicked off by high-level Centcom commanders regularly recorded a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism, as the actual conditions were allowed on site, and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services," quoted the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what has happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the Centcom extend to the top point of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report highlights detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct indications that government spikes under Obama have given orders to change the reports, it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their hierarchies, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than facts," the report noted. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a Centcom subscriber publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican representative of Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015, the Central Command points changed the intelligence reports to run down the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights, while the investigations will continue."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway through the Secretary-General of the Defense Department."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015 Centcom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence estimates for ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the high-ranking Demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Ship, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, such as Mr. Schiff, delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "compensated the morals among analysts and" "gave excessively little space for dissenting opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no indication of the annexation of the White House at the Centcom analysts with regard to a" "certain political opinion". ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"the preliminary results of the investigators of the Congress were published on Tuesday through" "The Daily Beast". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector who received complaints from CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, announced that the Defense Department had no comment on the congress, while the inspectors of the General inspector were still under way."</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also admitted that "experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these key issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have further effects on the question of a successful aerial campaign conducted under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a statement made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"the allegations last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism with regard to the Secret Issues on the Islamic State resembled disagreements of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, presented a document of how the then government under George W. Bush approached only a small occupation force in Iraq, and had little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the statements of the government, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these temporary refineries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damaliger command, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of his overly positive appraisal of the war situation during a hearing in front of the Senate."</seg>

<seg id="9">The first place will leave the strong Dutch a little longer from the way the other group will guide.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game ends on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising swirl through their success story, four years after they ended up in the past London games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time with three years she had a hockey racket in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became National player of the United States, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work schedule in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to snatch the helm completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a setback from the local area."</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into play without a win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and leaped the ball into the gate to give the American female a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late as it is, it's the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inescapable, a rapid relay between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, that is passed from the wrist protection to the swimmer to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't switch on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Leutzy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women's flock with dimples, could well be among those well-known names sent to Prime Time, if he was a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic gymnastics tournament."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not elucidate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shade, are the sports that are not generally accepted: airbrush shooting, Archery, Badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may there be long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it became so sparsely perceived the last 16 years that many people I had questioned, did not know that it was a Olympic sport at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it never won a medal in the trampoline and until 2012 had had an athlete who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians who share the same for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outside-charme, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a grounded enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending impact, but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, which combines two sports, which essentially unites it."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El oline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"rising winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling motions (turning, hencing and salts) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to official Olympic programme, they are rated according to execution, difficulty level and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists in their quest for gold continue to go faster, upwards and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and down, upwards and downwards on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they chase not only the finish line or the output wall, but in the televised transmission also another undermining goal: the world or the Olympic record."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think about when watching these games as something.</seg>
<seg id="30">"of this, the trampoline offers a respite."</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline bed is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end-hours as part of a afternoon block on both days from 2pm.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the middle of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the objective of male athletes - as the male U.S. Turner has recently proposed to the The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley expects his following air rinse, new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia are sticking to the violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police during shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the last few months protests against the government shook the country, refusing to expand into more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response to human rights organisations was relentless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen were shot dead on umpteen unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the videos on the protests, which are probably from the last or early this year, show how security professionals hit young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN authority for human rights now requires an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorists across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get as much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively being silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or imprisoned, killed or driven into the desert of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold with regard to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a large criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea rise; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo-liberation front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been imposed more or less in recent years, exploit the turbulence and rearming themselves."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode under the surface under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first one seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave their attention to the protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since eons, the Amharas, which are predominantly Christian high countries from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy, while they explode the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to co-ordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and that are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, had until his death in an unpublished illness in 2012, 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly savvy in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively unclear reasons to take Mr Meles's position."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the North Ethiopian Tigray region, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval in 2005 after thousands against elections evidenced, according to analysts apparently pledged by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and their measurable progress in poverty alleviation."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intention of intensifying the internal misfortune of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters attacked Gondar, an amharish city, run by Tigray and the hate against the tigray becomes more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the U.S. government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflüge over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently claimed that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains Obama's statement on ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"on Friday, Donald J. Trump attempted to dispel the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by attacking that his repeatedly repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the" founder "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification raises new questions about the communication skills of the Republican candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings together his comrades who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position that he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after he had made the hint at a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump kicked back in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret, the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was contrary to the previous day, on which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant that the allegation was totally serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt, Mr. Trump, wanted to weaken the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism prasselt down on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to draw the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values on the economic situation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan during this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump attempted to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he asserted strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, but later he said," Of course, I thought the sarcastic. ""</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic limits in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans, how they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump took an even estimated tone as his survey values continued to decline."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-at-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often blames his critics to distorted his statements or misunderstand his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps threw his loyalist opponents into the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how provocative his statements might be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of the most prominent intercessors, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in this sense, it is true that before Obama IS an almost unknown, small organization, he called it hammers, completely wrong and that's why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most Mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in the MS Clinton administration, served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread out by aggressively taking control of the situation in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on each of his words and being prejudiced against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he mockoned the" poor, miserable "television experts who try to understand him and said," You can't!. ""</seg>

<seg id="8">"a busy Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the new verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old cafe, the owner and managing director of the new cafe."</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Gegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COE last book" Chop Suey "acted by Chinese cuisine in the U.S., while Ziegelman told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, savoury snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"54, ordered a sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable dishes."</seg>
<seg id="12">As the reporter asked Hackheed this was fitting the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food items were very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there was peanut bread, Leberkäse and Bohnenbrot."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheaper that the ingredient streches.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating as many peanuts as they serve them as a dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat Buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cooked for male fields and it was served freshly baked pastries for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "records the roads with which the country was surrounded by no longer being the land of land."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when eating for Americans was a central, tense subject," "said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was equally tense: mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became staple food, the casserolle being a" "wonderful way to recycle food residues," "noted Ziegelman, as cooks could conceal unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for many years, became a rarely served luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures were tried because a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction appealed to taste or even wholesome food.</seg>
<seg id="27">"during their research for the book, which includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that period, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at noon," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Ziegelmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions do not match each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the home business recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before, or ever since, driven budget economists - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by published prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" "budgetary politicians" "and the challenge of converting Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a festival of historical delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens, like President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-cake-food-attitude."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly praised the simple Iowa country house cuisine of his kitchen, he spoke as the millionaire man of the world to which he became."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cooking as fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gold-plated dining-room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully opposed to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">"President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake, if his wife Eleanor had asked him to do an example with his stomach."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland haie usually only comes to surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after an investigation, this shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna."</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland harks have only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Greenland shark swims down at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches exactly 1,220 feet on average."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it matters, the five-meter-long animal accelerates at about 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, this lifestyle embossed by slowness seems to be a panacea for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal" Science, "at least from a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"mad," comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"although the evolutionary biologist predicted long, Greenland haie would become stone-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland haie is hard to watch, finally they live mainly in the polar sea before the sparsely populated coastal waters of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear in winter at the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers do not know little about the Greenland haie's lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">"her timelines stretch to her, when she furnished six animals with a transmitter."</seg>
<seg id="18">"this sharks still make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"they possibly hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the polar ocean and look for cadaver, which torch from higher water layers."</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland shark who took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, whereas the largest 502 centimeters were measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens appears before the birth of the sharks, the protein contained therein will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons search for greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"the lenticular nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons by its length of 220 centimeters and is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the other hand, all larger Greenland haie had normal carbon-14 amounts in their linens, which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 watch showed a 493-cm long Greenland shark at an age of 335 years, while the record shark might be even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers could assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland haie with the reproduction obviously leaves at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusals live mainly in icy waters is not accidental.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the old record holder, a 211 years old Grönlandwal, whose bacon was stuck on the neck a 120-year old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on sparring flames."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often especially large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal gets heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as soon as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"on the other hand, a very large animal should rather invest in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="1">"cave Callum Skinner storms home, as Brite Gold wins for cycling"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Scottlands Callum Skinner razed last night in the men team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio for fame, when the British team defended the title of London 2012."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself."</seg>
<seg id="4">"England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took place in March at the World Championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time for execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Hoy's retirement has produced a gap, the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man in which they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots, which now unfolds."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner scored an Olympic champion in qualifying laps, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hindes fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which one went into a higher gear to slow it up and enable Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy saw from his position as a BBC expert and fell skinner, Kenny and Hinder than they got on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and to make a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have set up an olympic board in the final round and the World Champion is defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenny's and Hoys, he agreed that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection of England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such a superior victory, there was no such problem this time."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he said," It feels with all the UK flags on the grandstand like London. "</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress in the past five months, we expect to be successful five days in the bicycle."</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would mean Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently sacred date for the British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - mean a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny will be part of the Sprint race that will start today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," I just enjoy this for the moment. "</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," "If he won two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were more good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They came in 3: 51,942 at the finish. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"world record, which won in 2012 in London Gold, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday, he was contested with officials before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB Team relies on his strong web wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to catch a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"tragedies played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of sexism and munitions, as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"but if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite like the legendary call GBs, which has reached its climax at the perfect moment, will be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the smelting of Portland due to annulment of the energy consumption questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the system operator can terminate the energy supply contract and thus lift all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy companies."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies for the operation of the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workplaces at the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">"not less than 2000 workstations - direct, indirect - could be at risk of closure."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects since the melting shop consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa acquired the Point Henry Melting, which led to a closing of Anglesea power station last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting furnace with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, indicated that three other owners will terminate their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by melting," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were so called" "hedging operations", "which should have come into force from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a 12 month notice period, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenues in the fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on revenues on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong terminal markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL informed that the value of the contracts had already been written down in his annual subscription amount of $187 million in" "anticipation of termination". ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" ability of Alcoas... to operate the melting shop, or to ensure the power supply to the melting "does not interfere."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have come into effect from November this year, even if it is still a declaration of why it has resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn due to the poor economic conditions of the sector prior to the possible closing of the Portland smelt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements of analysts at the start of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Michkelsen said that Portland will consume around 600 megawatts per year and around 900 megawatts of electricity per year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generating set, that would not be good," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clan's Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on their Instagram account on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to cry," "wrote Kendall."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the unveiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the cardashians like?), a critical reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn), as well as in the presence of the all-loved showbiz-Onkels and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), which ends with a classic turn: they all have a surprise party planned."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this presents the stereotyped action nearly every birthday from a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought that we had forgotten you?", "with the honesty of a cartoon squad at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of Vogue, security began a new era of cardashians."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014, but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for her."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most selling edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that resembles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracted a large number of advertisers. (According to the 832 pages of the paper 615 pages advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his coverstars is eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine had leaked out before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women, who were already on the cover, include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there have been more" celebrities that modeled "as" Models, the celebrities, "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar Winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - falls below the previous category, is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teens of today who know how to turn a good snapchat video (even if this applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with Lemonade's release."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners's success doesn't like everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with its reality TV history, Jenny's position in the world of fashion was always tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised her and called her" "Miststück des Augenblicks." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"these feelings were cooked up again, when the message came out with Jenners release on the Vogue cover."</seg>
<seg id="23">"but on the Missmut, it seems to pass by at the point."</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your priming Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all your sisters will sell you pictures of yourself on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She was sold to the magazine LOVE by Cindy CRAWFORDS daughter.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her spare time she is to be seen in reality TV. presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="3">"today, the successors dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster."</seg>
<seg id="4">The tool weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was rather clunky."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory initially amounted to eight Megabytes, which would suffice today for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" "Nokia 9000 Communicator" "occurred exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, in the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros, fans can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they date back to the age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"but 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier on the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as an "Western media office."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone was able to transmit a lot for those standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator could be reached."</seg>

<seg id="1">England must direct the Olympic spirit and Heathrow expand</seg>
<seg id="2">"Heathrow will not only bring renewal and prosperity to our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just like in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great advantages to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we will work alone already 10,000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of expanding heathrows is too great."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming at the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any asked question."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for some infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 bn in real growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and the whole of the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2 that was built in the middle of the two most frequented drives in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third running track, which is supported by £16 billion on private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time that we direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="2">"for companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software producers try to bypass ad blocking, a" "cat and mouse game". ""</seg>
<seg id="3">"on Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display lockings on his desktop, Adblock Plus published a blog post that told users that users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertisements in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that his desktop page would change encoding with regard to its advertisements in order to detect the indication of which part of the page advertising is advertiser."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams writes that" this kind of hard-and-going battle between the antimed Open Source Community and the converters has already been underway since the invention of display lockers, and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest enterprise for social media has entered the struggle is a strong indication of how worrying scorers have become the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use display lockers worldwide, almost four times as much as 2013."</seg>
<seg id="9">"with 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the company has posted it on Desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile apps for the social network and instagram, shared a speaker."</seg>
<seg id="11">"advertisement on desktop computers makes a sufficient amount of revenues, so that Facebook is the investment of such a step as worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its" ad preferential pool "to keep people more control over them."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be worrying about new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising."</seg>
<seg id="14">"for the users, this is not a positive experience, so we are planning to address the problem," commented on Facebook in an e-mail message. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"advertisers are a blunt instrument, which is why we have instead focused on developing tools such as Ad Preferences, in order to get more control over the hands of the people."</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was transferred to a suspected suicide by several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman took refuge in the dark" in an act of despair "on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 passed by several vehicles, including a truck, tried to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died still locally.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigative procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation," divided Gilles Hofstetter to Le Tribune de Geneve. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidance?</seg>
<seg id="12">"that is something the prosecutor has to decide," "said Hofstetter."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases - in which a person in the dark ran on the motorway, it was decided that drivers must not assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the motorway, as it was in the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="15">"last year a police officer of the negligent murder was acquitted, after having passed a man and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, took the judgment."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the court stated that the policewoman, who had responded to an emergency call -- was justified in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a" completely extraordinary and unforeseeable situation, "the judge said."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have exposed to similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin, dull atmosphere and nevertheless turned slowly."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably showed more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to its day-side of the Sun nearly two months," "explains GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model emerged a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously thought by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it once was probably habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billions years -- was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away from the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogene escaped, there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today."</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of rotational rates among the stars of the Plejaden star enhancer.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data will help astronomers to understand why stars in star cluster rotate to different rates and in what context the rotational periods are associated with planetary creation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star enhancements, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="5">The Sternenhaufen of the Pleiades lies 445 lightyears from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">"many stars in this star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood."</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning faster.</seg>
<seg id="8">"at top-of-the-top rotation rates, these stripping stars repel large amounts of starches."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since these winds travel through the magnetosphere of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars."</seg>
<seg id="10">"when a star fails, its rotation rate begins to slow down."</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest indication of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars revolve more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers with bigger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the Sternenhaufen of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers from blackmailing have currently access companies - and they are successful.</seg>

<seg id="4">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims had willingly paid the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to blackmail ransom is much higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the damage software," explains Malcauebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski talking to the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in recent months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, she is searching for recently changed files like Word-, Excel or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"after that, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the end key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users are the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business operations, in a case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany already several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients can be acute threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always tell the victims: pay not, it only encourages the problem," "explains Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety investigators of F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and the contact with blackmail and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service in order to earn more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decode for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private individuals are redeemed after payments of only a few hundred euros, companies must negotiate a hard time and pay five digits to get back their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware solution, the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is about three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware kits have been created by making the malware available for themselves, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes a customization tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackouts are looking for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so you logist in one of the boards on the ground, buys the set from a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals then delegate spammers with the dissemination," explains Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better safeguard their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful growth, the perpetrators are threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price scaling," explains Malcauebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"this means that the damage potential, depending on the type of data, is still much higher than before."</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack all: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivans."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the HR-V is very small only 1.60 m, the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the rear."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the interior materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top side drops out."</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is not only a boot space of 453 l with raised and 1026 l with reversed backrests available, but there is the" "Magic Seats". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"this is less magically, than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like chin chairs and thus offer storage space, which is 1,24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">"however, he should make his work somewhat quieter."</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">All-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort."</seg>
<seg id="17">But steering seems to be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the tested top version" "Executive", "the equipment leaves nothing to be desired."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the security systems are part of the City emergency braking assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane assist system."</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-beam assistant is very reliable.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent Temporegler responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttle when necessary the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI Connectors are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">"those who don't want to invest so much will receive petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros."</seg>

<seg id="2">Here is a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this should change: the regulation of law should be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the ambient road every evening in the traffic jam if they are driving over the motorway to Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">"on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August), the road construction company extended the legal distance lane by 700 meters (16 / 17 August) in the area between Hammer Street and Weseler Straße."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, one walks around for a long time; at night, one is awake for hours, in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep in the morning before the wake-up ring."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How are sleeping problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several types of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes underlying them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weemia, member of the board member of the German Society for sleep and sleep medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands inland, however, is the Insomnia, i.e. a disturbance and sleep disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the Durchgehen means many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagner's necht, member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"organic, mental or behavioural factors can be identified, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is especially common in case of depression," says Weemia. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are mutually dependent.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, those who have a herniated disc can lie badly, wake up every two or three hours, and possibly start to ponder about everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to a doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">"if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is compromised a day, should go to the doctor, advises Weemia."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can look quite differently: one is beaten, tired, exhausted, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve the sleep disturbance, it is important to find out the causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany, it is hard to find quiet sleeping mediators, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleeport of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"for this reason, you should first contact the family doctor if you have sleeping problems."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to the sleep laboratory, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"in order to study in the sleep laboratory, physicians will advise for example snoring with respiratory droppers, for sickness-free day fatigue, sleep-changers, or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, Fibaque explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not make a nap," says Fibaque. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after cladding, one goes to bed at a normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nasal glasses, a chest strap and a feeler right at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera draws on the ceiling to sleep."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>

<seg id="5">"article about this" trendy district, "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, in recent weeks preferred to be illustrated with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have leased contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel recorded several times for a hard action of the police against the project, the area called" no-go-zone "for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Cadet smiths, had been cleared by 300 police officers, police patrolled three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, blocked off parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"during the meantime, the building workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown landowners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers pulled off the cheers of sympathisers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of houses in the sun, others entertain early Späti."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the building projects, a primary school and kindergartens are located."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left-wing force is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, is mainly generated by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the residents of the house projects, they share the concern of increasing rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it doesn't sound like a Kiez, which caused several local police protection from the vandalous left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police establish between house owners and their neighbors, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers" district, even today compared to the rest of the city, a low average income and high poverty risk. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990 many houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street near Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer was swept under a large police force in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rīga and partly inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, in recent years, the borough has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and constituents from all over the world: now residents of GDR times and former home occupants share their neighbourhood."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on designed discs or newly painted facades that were fired with colour bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year together with the words "left autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason for not all neighbours to regard this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime: crimes such as bodily harm, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against police officers."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the criminal offences make damage to property, which tends to hit the newly built houses and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenancy house next to the disputed 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as far as violence is concerned, it is weightless: the people in 94 are their neighbours, they have not been determined."</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rīga anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately moved into the Rīga Street.</seg>
<seg id="31">"this is why it was so important that the residents get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by unobstructed new buildings in former construction gaps that displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - there are more people who are not so well drunk," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "violence and destruction can I absolutely not approve."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone never listens to someone?</seg>

<seg id="20">"the costs for building, rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the councillor to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in fact, administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it did not work, so you may rely on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, the apartments must be repaired as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customers and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a solid lead, there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and support activities for refugees and migrants who have to be tiled or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house mastering, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that working for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is' no employment therapy '.</seg>
<seg id="35">"however, activity does not only mean labour."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day requires a solid structure, say Deuschle and Customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteers are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain to the refugees that it takes just and they can make sense to bridge the time, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help nobody in Urbach, don't want to work and be useless, he will never integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are problems, too, says customer honestly," people with whom nothing works. "therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">This is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: have the two after the recent occurrences afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer quite plainly, "what a person may call naïve." but a residual risk cannot and does not want to exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents also include the issue of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would be afraid that the assassins will bring them up completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So major and local volunteers must look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants would soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics abhors itself."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to spot them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," says Annika Deushle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already busy trying to integrate the previous people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">"this is currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they have to help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
