Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as over T@@ ehr@@ an dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been stra@@ ined for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu free will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal of the Iranian nuclear program promoted by Obama , the relationship of the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu presented a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress which was partly regarded as aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , professor adm@@ its to have shot his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ annon told Lamb with a somewhat sad voice of the police , that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , which I wanted to reverse , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; this was written by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , already had 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular historian professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ zeich@@ ung Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call at some point after that .
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life , when the police enc@@ ir@@ cled him . &quot;
&quot; one day after the shooting in the university , the students and faculty forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and collabor@@ ators who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his teaching .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ la died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal background . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself mentioned lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both set up in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for an absence of health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which lamb had worked so hard for him , would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police found a late Lam@@ bs lane when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , lamb also killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said they believed that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; lamb began working at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and education . &quot;
he received his doc@@ torate in the spring of education .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 , when they met with friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool old guy who attempted a few years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
he was the women &apos;s nurse at that time .
&quot; all girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson suburbs of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no evidence of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that ad@@ joins a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail played both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played the one or the other gig together .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings its own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he finished lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 . September for the last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ica in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no indication that something did not agree .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were fr@@ aming and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense for joke .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was chairman of his br@@ otherhood and the student &apos;s Committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening , about 900 people , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community participated in a candle @-@ light commem@@ oration ceremony on Tuesday evening . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the watch guard , while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to the return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ dot@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had shot the emergency after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb is called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
toys R Us say that it will not be so many Christmas season employees like last year but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently working employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
&quot; the company said it plans to employ 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 4@@ 5,000 workers were hired . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees is increasing from October to December .
&quot; while the holidays themselves are still months away , Christmas business moves closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p shops with employees that sell , send and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons too .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simulated g@@ äh@@ nen and an arm length of it , to be with the Princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary on &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and Producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; Un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that Russia &apos;s response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is , &quot; There is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the br@@ ink of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria which they proved to achieve a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it doesn &apos;t work ( yet ) . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys have shown Donald Tr@@ ump in the two @-@ digit range , and some start asking seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ rin &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom did not only win a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now realizing pumps staying power and starting to let their dollars flow , to precip@@ itate it . &quot;
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
dump@@ s Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a Mon@@ mouth @-@ University survey showed that only two of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
&quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump nomin@@ ates . &quot;
only two out of 10 say they were &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; when he was the candidate .
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Repub@@ lican voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the re@@ public@@ ans does not see the temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters think that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the nation &apos;s first constitu@@ ent state , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to perform effectively , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament not p@@ asse in the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they put up their duty @-@ on @-@ duty contrac@@ tions , re@@ public@@ ans hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; when asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nomin@@ ee , after a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , four out of ten last week , Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change from the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the final cycle , four out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination to just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters can watch Tr@@ umps campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump suggests almost everybody . &quot;
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to umps leading while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other Can@@ did@@ ates .
&quot; but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump pic@@ ks up the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he got 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ ste and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate that beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half the voters support Tr@@ ump , say they have given their votes firmly . &quot;
&quot; of course much can happen to change that , and no one can truly say to never change opinion . &quot;
46 per cent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; nonetheless , m@@ umps is the strongest competition in the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with tr@@ ump on the issue of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump was named &quot; &quot; R@@ ape &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration of the pi@@ vot@@ al and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the 2016 public discourse . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump will hold decisive His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans away from the Repub@@ lican party and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ Survey of Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with tr@@ ump on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration is left in the lim@@ el@@ ight , it seems to do Donald Tr@@ ump as well . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for about half of the support of Repub@@ lican voters , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey conducted by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience . &quot;
and they are mad at Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish@@ ly anno@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sylt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
the house is heated by electricity . 2 bathrooms with shower . 2 toilets .
&quot; in the street , a square meter of a reed roof costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sylt the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular clim@@ ates one square meter is the most cost .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; V@@ ölk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square footage ratio in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro no - per square meter , noted . &quot;

&quot; by the way : Munich , as an exception , is not at the top . &quot;
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double keeper in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to FC Bayern to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ äus - then it ran .
a sovereign kick off of the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their first game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and G@@ ötz@@ er hits ( 89 . ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth grid success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola will finally take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; Müller received the Champions League in the Champions League for awar@@ ding a good help from Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had a f@@ atten@@ ed shot of the world champion . &quot;
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ahm promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich thought . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without to shine .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus won his most recent home games in the royal class , including notable clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid and Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went bol@@ dly , but with their aggressive efforts often too resour@@ c@@ eful to work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often introduced to the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the upper left corner . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ 7. minute , the World Champion promised the potential 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first of all , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct @-@ dinner , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the knee par@@ ked ( 35@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could put needle @-@ stick @-@ stit@@ ches . &quot;
but on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neu@@ er was a decree .
&quot; for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of Ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te ( 56 . ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola had to defend a qu@@ ad with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ stration , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after gradu@@ ation , said Sport@@ show Matthias Sam@@ pler at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it is mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought the King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59 . ) . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , with m@@ illed m@@ illed m@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; before the game , it was in the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ alle . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partly w@@ alled Bavaria fans in their audience @-@ block obviously prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with bat@@ ons against the Munich fans . &quot;
at least one Bavaria fan was injured in the stadium .
smo@@ kes have a higher risk to lose teeth
&quot; if you smoke , you will not only damage the lung , but also your teeth - this will suggest a long @-@ term study of Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : if you ren@@ ounce the risk is reduced quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of loos@@ ing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of loos@@ ing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely in order to increase the 2,5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; main causes for dental loss are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the g@@ ums , acc@@ entu@@ ates the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these peri@@ odon@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between cigarette smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent gum infections in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the haz@@ ard falls back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; explained Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one has to persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained study director H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , results in good dental health up to a high age . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
earlier studies have pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study em@@ its the findings .
archae@@ ologists come across from the town of Cologne on rem@@ n@@ ants from the late Anti@@ quity
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine . &quot;
&quot; close to the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called floor monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a specialized office for archae@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; in the third part of the Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists were now five . &quot;
&quot; from text documents had already been known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; besides rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and church tower a cemetery with some 350 graves has been discovered , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman from a freight train captured
&quot; after a young woman died at the train station in the &quot; &quot; Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ der &quot; , &quot; the Federal Police is asking the people for assistance . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 p.m. , the woman crossed the railway station toward the station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; by collecting the train , she carried most serious injuries to the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated with emergency medical care and taken by ambul@@ ance personnel to a hospital .
&quot; on the basis of the ni@@ ghtly cross @-@ crossing of the young woman , the bud@@ ding officials did not find any evidence . &quot;
the incident was possibly witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .

EU Commission propos@@ ing new court in dispute over the TTIP
&quot; to def@@ use the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function reflects clearly more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens , &quot; &quot; stated Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot;
the Swedish Parliament introduces the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TTIP , the largest free trade zone of the world with 800 million people is to be created . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings consider specifically that the EU states and the US jointly selected independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot;
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it would allow it to rise against jud@@ gments .
&quot; until now , the parties involved in the proceedings against each other on arbitr@@ ators , there was no objection to their jud@@ gments . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , according to his own statements , she wants to work towards an international investment court . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , especially from large corporations , are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parallel judicial law , which allows companies to viol@@ ate tax pay@@ ers , negotiate national legislation , or to en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act adopted the proposals of the European Commission to be insufficient . &quot;
&quot; critic@@ ised , above all , that they should not be considered for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;
&quot; the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described plans as a major advance . &quot;
&quot; during the reform , the Commission considers essential points to be drawn up by the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , in the spring of other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned about limiting the economic performance of the business by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , on Wednesday remained unclear . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .

Del@@ ik@@ ater Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , where the shy but@@ cher has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of various places he repeatedly records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs tell . &quot;
where they were born and what it looks like in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has turned out to be a wonderfully creative Irish . &quot;
&quot; with the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; kl@@ ug @-@ composed songs seem to be very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can be dri@@ fted into great opul@@ ent times at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ our , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first install@@ ment of a dis@@ car@@ ded series : each of the 50 states should be in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and in the Rhine region &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive anticip@@ ation . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .

&quot; one year later , the musician returns to the series in New York . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Hel@@ oise &quot; ) , a masterpiece celebrated in 2005 . &quot;
b@@ ord@@ ingly reminiscent of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no annual list of the influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic components . &quot;
&quot; this sixth studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but performed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and hall . &quot;
&quot; long since the smaller clubs got off , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle from ne@@ on brow@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
in the dark held Hamburg More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the much more mature St@@ ev@@ ens comes back to intim@@ acy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ened album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can thus throw off the &quot; &quot; plate fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only to an enc@@ ore , St@@ ev@@ ens is modest , acousti@@ cally plays a few older songs and finally bow@@ les to thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tions
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut has been anticip@@ ating eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut in the Prime Minister .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s mission and for the first time create David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after noon . his performance by the media is prob@@ able and the Labour MPs are examined nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , because after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has been prov@@ oked by a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several cover stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns shadow kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked within Labour &quot; &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements towards the position of the European Union and the limit in profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour would make changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow labour and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the cap of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23,@@ 000@@ pounds . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader who has since become a T@@ ory leader in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says that he has &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ aire is too con@@ front@@ ational , and that he will be subject to serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he has also brought the idea that other colleagues can occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ hurt , speaker of the House of Comm@@ ons , in order to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he would remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; cas@@ per@@ le theatre &quot; &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire . but a few years later he admitted he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , it was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pound increases by accelerated growth in the UK
&quot; the pound rising sharply to dates , which show an increase in the growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller building target . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and delivered assessments on the time of an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
&quot; FT@@ SE 100 Index finished with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 22@@ 9,@@ 21 . &quot;

Bur@@ berry shares were 0.9 % higher following encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore shares rose by 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken 2.5 billion $ through a stock sales as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
&quot; the shares of Mond@@ i Packaging and Paper Group were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company rating on &quot; selling . &quot; &quot;
JD Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports lending company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
JD Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compens@@ ate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

&quot; Met@@ cash tries to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di invasion , in South Australia and Western Australia . &quot;
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a soil competence campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like Eis@@ manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ haven , who distri@@ butes samples in IG@@ A stores and shop owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ a will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholesale merchant for food , alcohol and equipment goes through its annual investor @-@ strategy day . &quot;
&quot; it is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will remove all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analysts Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that IG@@ A retail@@ er could lose 360 million sales per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost basis could cost some 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent conducted survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ a will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ a refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ a contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; i@@ Gas market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has been supplied by approximately 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , has declined by 43 percent since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ ed and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to improve sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and deliver IG@@ A retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of private label food . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Chief Executive Officer Ian Mor@@ rice says that prices adjustments and load refurb@@ ishment programs are to be put on é@@ lan , and hopes that the major dealer will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association , Steve He@@ aly &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism of his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent assault on his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise for his own conduct according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with the not@@ orious confrontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ ros with St@@ an W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison ex@@ claimed : &quot; &quot; W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka would have hit Cyr@@ gi@@ os and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a cr@@ amp sh@@ ook a potential US Open win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am rather excited about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drag@@ ged into the dispute , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et when he lost due to a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a r@@ ack@@ et out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he has been treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to do not take Kyr@@ gy@@ ros during the important preliminary decision , which starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on competition and not all around the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ ros &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the lim@@ el@@ ight , where he can only think about it , we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . &quot;
&quot; Europe refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency stop , ex@@ cludes the border , res@@ ists refugees &quot;
&quot; Hungary explains the emergency situation and marked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illegal into the country , with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indign@@ ation . &quot;
the people fle@@ eing from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip along the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants &quot; op@@ holes the border ! &quot; and sm@@ iled ins@@ ults to the Hungarian prepar@@ edness police . &quot;
some exp@@ elled from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block at a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be reconc@@ iled .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were looking for refuge in the over@@ l@@ ump@@ ed Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive further 120,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday to discuss a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; but Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , an emergency meeting in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to get out of the crisis so they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said , that his country also plane the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania , in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck and the entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia . these laws also place higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted tra@@ ff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation , &quot; said Prime Minister Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities were 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by sh@@ aking the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounding the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and press a crowd in order to push it down there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to come in , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton has continued to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the first elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rising by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ eling for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the pre @-@ elections , most democratic elec@@ tors say that it is too soon to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News Survey Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased . &quot;
&quot; your support in the men has fallen sharply , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points back . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic elec@@ tors under 50 years has fle@@ dged , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , still has a big margin in older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a two @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ election authorities would say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would support them only because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
&quot; maybe not surprisingly , that Clin@@ tons are the latest supporters especially excited by her . &quot;
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic elec@@ tors of the pre @-@ elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Repub@@ lican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it is time that a woman president will be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters will also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the di@@ vis@@ ability are also cited .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president raises a potential for the presidential office into the scales , 57 per cent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries are asked who for the party would be their second choice , bees are at the top . &quot;
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call on questions about voting . &quot;
&quot; similarly , as last month , there is no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this voters of the pres@@ election as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some key features among voters in the pres@@ election of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities Con@@ sider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; among the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts the best from hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in agreement with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic elec@@ tors have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server will continue to be placed as foreign minister during the term of office , most of the Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are happy with their declaration of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public overall .
&quot; half the Americans are now uns@@ atis@@ fied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on the general opinion of Clinton , though 36 percent said that their opinion was still worse . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of her party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters . only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 per cent of the eligible voters see also Tr@@ ump as not honest and trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good notes while conducting . &quot;
&quot; among the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush excell@@ ently cut off with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son many do not think of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves to nationwide survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son finds himself close to Donald Tr@@ ump at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son returned from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under repub@@ lican voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ governor John Ka@@ uns , is beaten off with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen on the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % in third place . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from re@@ public@@ ans in this latest pol@@ l is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son climbs in the surveys - he lands with 19 % support with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the most recent survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also revealed Tr@@ ump ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view to a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for former neuro@@ sur@@ geons , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question umps . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a presentation in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even when peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing holiday makers to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the north or the Baltic Sea is likely to be a very short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and the Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) shares with . &quot;
&quot; bathroom temperatures , on the other hand , continues to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even comes up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Neul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual of a student compound in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder appeals against five persons . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft release Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital which contributed to his death .
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with sand loaded with a 30 pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to move over a frozen field to a goal . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call on the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waiting for an hour before they brought him to hospital , the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ geln and Andy Men@@ g to contact the National president of the Brotherhood to get advice , police spokes@@ man Chris Wagner said at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide their utensils and basically set the Brotherhood &apos;s well @-@ being about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with mu@@ te force injuries to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year at the chic@@ anes , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
one County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an accus@@ ation due to murder of the third degree for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of criminal attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Society , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases the interest rates
&quot; there will be a rise in interest , and the house @-@ se will come into bankrupt@@ cy , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides only small guidance on the process . &quot;
a recession came after the first rate of interest only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so sharply stressed that investors should not concentrate on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather to the period needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to a zinc increase . &quot;
&quot; the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock which many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase hits , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets margin decrease from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market in the past 35 years is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase , rather flat in the last six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , chief facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest increases they often promote .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a interest increase in the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
market participants set up a interest increase of the F@@ ed all year and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ended on Thursday .
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade is only a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the In@@ cre@@ ased cycles of 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ al heights are put in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on loans is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
&quot; when bor@@ rowing , the yields appear to change as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the raising cycle , the bond @-@ makers are immediately falling , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st near Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
Jones means that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has increased , the yield curve has increased , lending ten@@ ders have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and comprehensive business , companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the USA will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debt are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively for three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will most lose , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings could be seen by higher yields , even if experts differ in the way how fast that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says member of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the sender for its &quot; &quot; de@@ duction &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also zi@@ pped to the BBC Music Awards and said they were only im@@ itated by The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the broad@@ c@@ aster to prove that he does something , which does not do the private transm@@ it@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; stupid &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also zi@@ pped to the BBC Music Awards that started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be the Br@@ its only under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you are trying to do something else - these are two spontane@@ ously named examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC Director General rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn from classical music anywhere else . &quot;
&quot; and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed . &quot;
&quot; and the involvement of Radio 3 , to find new music and to put new works on behalf , I think also very important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to put the commercial ri@@ vals on its feet . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , purchased by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for estimated costs of 22 million £ . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; , &quot; when the next time it starts a series of entertainment . &quot;

Internet sales rose in August most slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000 &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down the issues
&quot; for over a decade , virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have transformed into ghost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
&quot; experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 &quot;
&quot; if you consider growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales with the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , as buyers began working with their mobile purchases . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this is comm@@ uting itself , and we may experience that growth decreases . &quot;
&quot; the Black Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for decreasing sales . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers added to their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites fell off . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 is spending a little more than £ 1 online .
&quot; for some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims bury the dead in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are borne by Muslims in the first burial in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia sets down the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that , in addition , 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane r@@ ushed . &quot;
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead who were killed when a crane was crushed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ que .
&quot; mour@@ ned , largely dressed in white , the way to reg@@ ain their respect when the first of the dead stepped up their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the proc@@ ession went over to the Holy Shr@@ ine , where only days before a building crane was rus@@ hing through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the ends . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king left Ben Laden &apos;s construction company because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 who were killed when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central mo@@ z@@ ee of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents prior to the beginning of the annual h@@ add@@ ling in the Grand Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officers have already said that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to go to the city , will continue . &quot;
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden Group , would not have attempted to steal the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English service did not report this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership was forbidden . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man blessed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane which pl@@ ung@@ ed into an inner courtyard of the large mos@@ que where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for comment . &quot;
the Royal decree also imp@@ elled the Group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
&quot; dozens of cranes surround Mak@@ ka &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project , which is led by the bin Laden Group . &quot;
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the royal family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was de@@ ported by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is necessary at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
&quot; government representatives agreed that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured . &quot;
other injuries receive half of this amount .

&quot; she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends , which show more female single households that do more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift this more strongly towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions about the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher is the only company that occupies 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial performance . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group failed to pay for the shut@@ down of the shops .
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches because of the trend . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity to court
&quot; on Wednesday , at the Kl@@ agen@@ furt Regional Court , two officials from the Austrian volleyball tournament A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for lack of faith@@ fulness and spending . &quot;
the def@@ endants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he has been re@@ affir@@ med in May . &quot;
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the Adv@@ oc@@ ate General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ endants had been cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 @-@ 2011 were mon@@ ies of association accounts , which they were able to disp@@ oni@@ ze in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial off@@ enses .
&quot; this fact was the Chair of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the sake of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense provided that the association did not come into existence at any point in time . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials had only compens@@ ated expenses for expenses and the sports club , for whom they had spent a lot of time and money , out of debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we were standing in front of the situation : do we continue the club or lock we ? &quot; &quot; one of the accused , in the bread @-@ based tax profession of the finance ministry said . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his co @-@ def@@ endants and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have invested money , put our life insurance as security in the bank , &quot; he said at the time of arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , there must be no debt . &quot;
&quot; in case of adequate financial success , the withdrawal of the expenses for expenses was decided retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the expenses paid out only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus was on the account , paid off . &quot;
&quot; therefore l@@ ump sum and not detailed cancell@@ ations , the former chairman also explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and as@@ parag@@ rap@@ hs shared the two def@@ endants , the second def@@ endant said . &quot;
&quot; why the withdrawal of the association had not been disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial support , it is important that it was only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 , against the one function@@ ary investigation on account of office abuse , an amount of € 1@@ 20.000 was transferred to the club account . &quot;
&quot; these had been set@@ backs , the def@@ endants reported . &quot;
&quot; this securities account went to the name of the second def@@ endants and , according to the statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent knew no answer for a long time .
then he said he believed that this was the best for the club .
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room . &quot;
&quot; the def@@ endant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified . &quot;
&quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why compensation ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; the first def@@ endant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association was never damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; With this you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; the function@@ ary said he had never obtained a cent salary , he only calculated kilometers and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; on di@@ ets , he charged the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the def@@ endants were unable to prove accurate documentation for the early years .
&quot; these were no longer kept for a working test , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
kilomet@@ ric allowance also referred to the second def@@ endant .
&quot; all buildings are in cash , for that he must have to go to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his residence at the international market , he stated in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard starts another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the staff reductions running for three years , the computer giant will be able to reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the Stell@@ enb@@ ach@@ ungen of the US computer giant Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to reduce the breakdown of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate divisions . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the costs of $ 2.7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the mining of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP had some 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;

both business segments shall be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand for corporate clients after its services , set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; thus , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP has responded with a spl@@ itting up and massive jobs on change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company led by Me@@ g Whit@@ man has recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do business online .
&quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 positions . &quot;
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would mainly result in rejection : 54 per cent spoke against it , 35 percent were agre@@ eing . &quot;

forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ tion in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
&quot; at the Serbian border , the Hungarian police were deployed in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and floo@@ d@@ lights against several hundreds of refugees . &quot;
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police there was a police line and behind the polic@@ emen there was a head@@ light ready .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones , b@@ umps and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially put on an un@@ interrupted pepper spray .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn a little bit .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried . &quot;
other refugees stuck together and suffered under difficulty .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries caused by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank
&quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank is coming together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for nearly a decade the interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reuters found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to remain a little longer and the interest rates will last from 0 to 0.25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a major central bank could possibly leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Chief Executive Officer at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is based on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and only generate a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky view of global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision to be made at 20.00 o &apos;clock CET on Thursday
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues on the day and killed , Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say that &quot; &quot; he could do it wrong &quot; , &quot; stated authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi said that lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and said , &quot; &quot; He has fired on someone and has killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that police officers needed to send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house that &quot; nobody will distur@@ b , &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police questioned the c@@ aller according to his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
lamb didn &apos;t give explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen enc@@ ir@@ cled him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ sh had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ sh were &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot;
&quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; Lamb had inv@@ oked relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; as police officers caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , lamb drove his car to the side , flew by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
lamb received a doc@@ torate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015 .
stars who have lost their luck
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also said to fight drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly calls for its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group
the Lufthansa plans a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot;
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and uses Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no longer a management board for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the Euro@@ wings assembly line should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in the management team headed by Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ aud will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the future . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; until now , the organization of the 120,000 staff was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operated under the umbrella of the airline Air@@ line Group , representing three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the collective conflict with the pilot @-@ agreement cock@@ pit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the tried @-@ and @-@ tested strike . &quot;
that shared the union with them .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement arrangements for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predictable record result , &quot; &quot; cock@@ pit &quot; &quot; wants to come to viable results as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to several strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transition supply of the pilots , the background is the &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
it is fores@@ ee@@ able that the Lufthansa in the fight against competi@@ tor lines is out@@ sour@@ ced to the Euro@@ wings group &apos;s own image airline .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
&quot; at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven . &quot;
&quot; while this brought the left external def@@ ender to we@@ eping and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had burst into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being transported to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double bone structure and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantas@@ tically , and then happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it will last six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a red card and the suspension of a mil@@ limeter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not pen@@ alized the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a el@@ k meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I &apos;ll come back more strongly . &quot;
&quot; related : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of PS@@ V , &quot;
&quot; with the European Championship in France , England def@@ ender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno had suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ As Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction so it looked like he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ aller .
certainly David Cameron is familiar with The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it &apos;s a thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost mem@@ orized . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite kid &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 , decided to use Dr. Se@@ uss &apos;s eco @-@ label . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all nice and good , except that the following paragraph where Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book , instead introduces an ingredient of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; as if this would not be suspic@@ ious enough : the text presented by Cameron is in part like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely such a relatively low PR function was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s election circle .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was provided by Cam@@ er@@ ons staff , but gave no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; across Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; the Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as spin @-@ bowling and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
related news : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ eers are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ectors . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully kno@@ cks further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot;
&quot; the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not deliver such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test man gets to set his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances , like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ play .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I set up high . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 236 towards us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends naturally on the appointment of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of letting mos@@ ques in addition to Cook make what an extra spin bow@@ ler perform and four qu@@ ads would get , appeared , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he &apos;s a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her and there is no big difference . &quot;
&quot; my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 . &quot;
he made three hundred rings straight away and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the cad@@ re as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics on average 31 with the r@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there &apos;s no big number of backup spi@@ der who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made some smart additions to the coach . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ nes , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a fe@@ at coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , since he played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application to the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously said . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players don &apos;t determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
&quot; the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain out of the EU ) could gain access to Zul@@ auf , if the economy runs into a noisy cry by 2017 &quot;
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ developed ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper with every day , even without the choice of the genius of Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n becomes leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who is severely wounded for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at fre@@ und said recently that some member states are deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always of its own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they mostly do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb to the summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they will win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always around me .
&quot; my European friend who would like to look outside Britain inside the EU Zel@@ tes - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel &apos;s cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as for the exagger@@ ated long endurance champ@@ ions such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a da@@ zz@@ ling force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something they do not want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; so maybe some such Ministers possibly plan not inten@@ tionally helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to ha@@ sten the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be on its cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Press Centre in 1975 but were not that supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; they may be weak on Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who have made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ m Ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90@@ s . &quot;
&quot; with all his mad@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vill@@ ains , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and pseu@@ do non @-@ nation@@ als who possess most of our big newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air thought similar to her , but noticed that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you are better distributed ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ air himself than Bl@@ air himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the EU constitution which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back@@ door to him . &quot;
the press never missed him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly sla@@ p on the back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to w@@ ander for me - seems at risk of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wil@@ dest favor of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ anism can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; &quot; in radio and television this week said that the boy sc@@ outs were fighting in him , not to admit that the appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the seventy @-@ five years when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal towards his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to mediate - remember that he even touched me - News Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine remains important in the Age of TV around the clock , and above all in the vor@@ tex of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron any free card for Europe , which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities about EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past , is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin w@@ ander into political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
&quot; the US is already pretty disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by a somewhat reminiscent of British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , launched Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month reached the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily wind@@ y basis , &quot; on which he reas@@ oned his most important conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the alleg@@ ations &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis ( MC@@ DA ) analysis to bring their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously obtained by British American Tob@@ acco agent ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that they received funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was to receive after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the board are not delivered , but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes Champions , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco @-@ management of p@@ he took part .
&quot; the Group &apos;s research work indicates that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or limitations are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison with tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people are dying every year on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by showing up @-@ to @-@ date evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
BBC should give up East@@ enders says former head of Channel 4
&quot; former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ it@@ ters .
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC for making publicly @-@ legal programs , probably seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard @-@ disputed time @-@ windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and bands like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to get in contact with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communications Committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot;
&quot; if you want to hold the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t think about a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least give your production to programs that others do not do or commissioned . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs are financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I have to see how this should be public @-@ right television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC shall be to blame for evalu@@ ations &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts will show what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ enders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ law N@@ ic programs &quot; to BB@@ C4 should go where you can &apos;t measure the audience but they are fulfilling their tasks , and they can argue if they are performing on their apparent missions to justify four billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all of these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson told the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here .
&quot; of course , think of all , we all think that for 150 £ a year you get a great value here , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review , train and maintain their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission . &quot;
&quot; he said just few of the BBC production would now officially be class@@ ed as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , educ@@ ating and talking about the publicly @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alliances go to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they reson@@ ate with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
impulses are used by switching mot@@ ion@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the di@@ aphr@@ ag@@ m channels that react to ultrasound waves .
further on this topic : reading and writing brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the depths @-@ brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses in the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; round@@ worms do not generally react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani stated that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms cells .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion@@ als and activate the cells they are assigned , such as a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani changed gene@@ tically the worms so that some of their mot@@ ion@@ eur@@ one TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels carry . &quot;
&quot; when it applies ultr@@ asonic to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transfer into the worms where they turn on the changed mot@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which needs to be revealed to a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered tissue and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ de@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in tongues and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I recall the ten@@ se smile of those who I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ handed complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve @-@ popping up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , whether and where you have taken sab@@ bath years , where you are in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re honest Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract H@@ AH@@ AH@@ A , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like , in contrast to those that you would not speak with , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress up and cut their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted people receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; her room should be a retreat , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space blo@@ oming culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away to get back the energy I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow milit@@ ant is exhausted from rap@@ idity - and send him an SMS instead .
apro@@ pos drop : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
&quot; as you begin the university at the height of Back Man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people to imagine himself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are an decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; poor@@ ly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead people to sleep when you drop . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residence .
&quot; of course , the claw of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check with the dairy owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a more balanced deal than my ro@@ ommate , adding a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my hall asked her neighbors , if it was something to give them a little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted with even more loud music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly let her neighbours to sleep for two hours before she lo@@ aned her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour trial . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move to the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it would not be aby@@ sm@@ ally embarrass@@ ing if you keep a ro@@ ommate for your future marriage partner , dis@@ connect and then see them every day and perhaps see how she passes away all the common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future spouse , try to let your under@@ body speak a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fine when it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security , but don &apos;t miss anyone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot;
&quot; close your door and put your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but don &apos;t t@@ ack their poss@@ essions on the ceiling more than twice . &quot;

&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build a good and good building today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly the living space can be created : he builds in a project row houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the massive accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay at a large extent here .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a row house needs least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if you put people in blocks of living .
&quot; each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three residential units , each with four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can easily be rebuilt according to the individual needs . &quot;
how high are the costs ?
&quot; guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000@@ Euros , without grounds . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
guil@@ der : legally I have passed my project correctly .
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under construction , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities the space is missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their Town@@ house project ?
guil@@ der : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
date : 06 / 14 / 2009 Size :
but do you not tigh@@ ten competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years , but we built luxury flats that can hardly afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even everyday people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the self @-@ educ@@ ating mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot;
I &apos;ll show you how to build a cheap and good building even today .
that &apos;s what it is about .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s Only Dev@@ ise : full Attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one Dev@@ ise in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes te@@ amm@@ ate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; ahead of the start , the World Cup branch emphas@@ ised the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; that I have nothing left to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the Vice World Champion before the second race in Singapore on this Sunday from defending champion and two @-@ fold champion Hamilton .
the Br@@ ite already won seven out of the previous twelve races and takes the floo@@ d@@ light Grand @-@ Prix in the city state as a favorite .
&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Br@@ ite was able to win the race . &quot;
&quot; whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have an impact on the Grand Prix of Singapore , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; for days , a dark bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbour island Sum@@ atra . &quot;
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member in its ranks , thus increased the number of members to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul Gau@@ sel@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot;
Gau@@ sel@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honor@@ ary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
&quot; Gau@@ sel@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen , with a donation supported by Alfred Klein . &quot;
&quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who cannot muster the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent recruitment are also to be driven forward .
&quot; Gau@@ sel@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; Red @-@ Wh@@ ites &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town . &quot;
Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ office is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ markt Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Platz .
&quot; besides consulting , one can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been setting up with our out@@ patient care service that often caring relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are an infinite number of questions .
&quot; in addition , many services of the insur@@ ers are not often used because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ist and the Ci@@ tiz@@ enship service , as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is possible to use additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis combine in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the retirement centre for care and care , &quot; illustrated Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre will see both executives especially in demographic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
&quot; in addition , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the club meeting at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite to a regular soci@@ able supplement . &quot;
&quot; thus , the social foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well as possible in their familiar environment . &quot;
&quot; the Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday 10 a.m. to noon . &quot;

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang 92 @-@ years passed away
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on September 5th at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus touched on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus abandoned a honor@@ ary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as stated in the broadcast . &quot;

&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freel@@ ance architect , but was also active as a teacher , writer and institute director . &quot;
&quot; from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute for Design . &quot;
&quot; in the 1980s , he was entrusted with the institution of the treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg in Vienna and the reconstruction of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum . &quot;

&quot; according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he did not admit it intellectu@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; in the Bre@@ mer &apos;s inner city , Wiese was cut out just as he saw how outside a parking maneu@@ ver provided a pen@@ thouse for his white Chev@@ rolet Cam@@ aro . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Wiese ran out of the shop , s@@ laugh@@ tered the civil servant , and threw her the fine fine of money in front of his feet , as the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper reported . &quot;
&quot; at the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations and is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot;
&quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot;
only then will decide whether meadow will be shown or not .

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses anxi@@ ously seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ or@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 p.m. , three young men were on the road from Bad So@@ den to Sal@@ ma@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , one of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afghan , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at this point the group was at the level of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the grounds of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men now sh@@ ou@@ ted the young , and struck the face with the fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a nas@@ al disturb@@ ance and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the r@@ ack@@ et , he left his victim first . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home now . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their flat and passed there demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured before the building went to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was again attacked by the r@@ ack@@ et and another male member .
&quot; with the help of a stock@@ pile , one was beating on the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be transferred to a hospital for medical care .
date : 06 / 14 / 2009 Size :
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second r@@ ack@@ et was about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was cloth@@ ed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller to acquire practice breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( left to right ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ isti@@ llery .
&quot; we are also pleased to announce joint mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ preis U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and As@@ endor@@ ff mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , are lucky : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ isti@@ llery is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his side in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a re@@ building phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he will invest 3@@ 10000 Euro into the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympath@@ etic at first sight when the fel@@ low@@ ships met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently complet@@ es their specialty training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to get into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the garbage cans would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ isti@@ ller and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I just called them . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to practice their own practice in the future in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know the families over the years , and accompany them . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also see his own boss . &quot;
and so one agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
&quot; however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; Frank Müller , two @-@ time family father Frank Müller , grew up in several doctor &apos;s offices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Chief Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz and was voluntarily employed in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ isti@@ sen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) speci@@ alis@@ es in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the m@@ iller , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as home @-@ physicians . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the rooms will look modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and endurance EC@@ Gs and need a subscri@@ ber room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ P is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; as part of a subsi@@ dy programme of the district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) , the land@@ fill is given a subsi@@ dy of 50,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that practice will continue , &quot; emphas@@ ises Sard@@ inian mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Mu@@ eller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , about 2000 patients come into practice every quarter in practice , in the North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
&quot; in As@@ endorf , there is another practice practice . &quot;
a positive side effect of the practical acquisition by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ isti@@ llery in As@@ endorf .
&quot; if no successor had found himself , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; by the way , who visits Müll@@ ers Sprech@@ stunde , also looks especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the rock formation . &quot;
&quot; with their departure ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all the medical doctors have practiced for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gen@@ sen re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; after a long time , they feel a little melanch@@ oly . &quot;
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients often , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
her husband comple@@ ments laugh@@ ingly : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter site . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pressed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now border controls are also on our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum claim can also &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; do so . &quot;
the care and safety of people is in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; the Minister said . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia denied
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue to travel to Austria and Germany , and may also er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia was already strongly insp@@ ected as the outer limit of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , the Sloven@@ ian will not wish to unlock its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; according to the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried to travel in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby fields of corn .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has constantly taken police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it acts mainly for Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country reck@@ oned with some 4,000 refugees , said Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ j@@ evo to the Serbian @-@ Serbian border , which have previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it would be encouraging people to take certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we do that , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d in the morning , in the course of the day further buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants had been travelling all night from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border to Serbia that was around 500 kilometers away .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
this could indeed come to a somewhat far@@ ther west @-@ situated route to a somewhat far@@ ther west @-@ situated route to the previously predicted displacement of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed earlier that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible withdrawal situations in the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call for details , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot; . &quot; &quot;
perform strict checks to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good report to the country , as far as the standard border controls are concerned . &quot;
on Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
&quot; according to the media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm on Wednesday early at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
it would not at present take a very high number of refugees .
&quot; one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers rates migrants to dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distributing maps on which alternative routes are drawn up by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent in the border region . &quot;
stock h@@ ackers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber crime , which is accused of getting an insight into still un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the collected information , insi@@ der trading activities should have been made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the investig@@ ators were aston@@ ished by more than 100 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our country borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; says the SE@@ C release . &quot;
the trials against 32 other appe@@ ti@@ tes in the case lasted .
most of the def@@ endants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators are supposed to have acted both in the United States and Eastern Europe .

&quot; while some passing a pass@@ ant spontane@@ ously to the chal@@ k , and the sentence around &quot; my life affir@@ ms , &quot; &quot; can read , &quot; &quot; stop war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on . &quot;

&quot; led by Fed@@ Ex , financial outlook for 2016 reduced &quot;
Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter and the delivery giant lowered his prospects for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;

&quot; Fed@@ Ex Cor@@ p said to earn a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10@@ ,90 in the fiscal year that ends in May , 20 euro cent less than in previous forecasts . &quot;
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view is despite the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 per cent and effective on January 4th and despite higher den@@ si@@ ties for body transport of heavy and large packages , which will be elevated from November . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will yield solid yields , considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for holiday jobs were announced a day later as that of the Ri@@ val U@@ PS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex claimed 6@@ 92 million , 6 per cent more than in the previous year . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;

the card is a reminder that the chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices to be stable here .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives by the short @-@ term interest rate at the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data from the economy show that it is growing solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il on global financial markets might be anxious to intensi@@ fy this volati@@ lity by raising interest for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation primarily will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Head of Econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty about the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which makes the financial market uns@@ ett@@ led . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
&quot; however , the financial markets await the F@@ ed , with a key indicator which shows only a 30 % chance of increasing . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition unless the strateg@@ ists mil@@ der the blow by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value jump@@ ed at 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ sky , Head econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at that point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does so , she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that she did not panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a interest increase would re@@ assure the financial markets because they would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good ways to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow sharp@@ ening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the proposition was observ@@ able . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed , the improvement in the labour market in this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to the level which the F@@ ed looks like full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation ran under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can deal higher interest rates and need it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world collap@@ sed at the end of last month after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
&quot; in May , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that slow@@ ing the Chinese economy would re@@ fuel global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , whereas the Dow is now almost 10 % below the level of May . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would take the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US bank . &quot;
now he pre@@ di@@ cts that she will be waiting for at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved in the technical decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the influence of the central bank has been enormous . &quot;
&quot; the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion , dissolved the confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for Asset Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on the financial market movements linked to seemingly not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , a unanim@@ ous member of the Federal Open Market Committee , stands for a interest increase , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their loans by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market re@@ unification , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the interest @-@ fixing of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the latest turbul@@ ences do not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a tax increase because the markets are getting upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C at Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / storage was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot;
&quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai town . &quot;
&quot; the market / the warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewellery and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a auto @-@ department if you need motor oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes over an hour to stroll through the walks . &quot;
&quot; if the whole purchasing department makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the kitchen ( good and cheap ) in this shop is close to the coff@@ ers and has various picking options .
what is there : do you need something - something - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruits and much more . &quot;
&quot; the meat counter is extensive , as well as the fish bar - the staff behind the counter will clean and filter the fish and fry them even if desired . &quot;
&quot; a good part of the shop belongs to the solid freezing department . here you will find frozen cur@@ ry leaves , bit@@ tern@@ ess mel@@ on and gal@@ ang@@ y , whole du@@ cks , fish , beef bar , local saus@@ age , commercially prepared food and more . &quot;
&quot; who purchases here : restaurant owners and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot;
the wide gears are suitable for trol@@ leys and fork @-@ lift trucks .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
where it is located : the store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
&quot; parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants . &quot;
&quot; even if the shop is well @-@ attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : refugees for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
preparing a warm welcome is not without the involvement of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are many people who support un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with her body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 L@@ enzen .
&quot; every Thursday , she does it in the asylum seek@@ er home at the Dill@@ inger Straße . &quot;
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite different teaching than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pap@@ al society Rio Grande promotes healthy breast@@ feeding nutrition
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization Spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that su@@ ck breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research findings suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation to mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipality of Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar power plant .
&quot; the planning for long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ around building at the Bern@@ ese Sport@@ arena is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal council meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction work without major discussions was unanim@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; before that , the committee had already approved an application for an &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; from the valid construction plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; exception , &quot; it was about the permission for a special form in relation to the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ ogenic first and roof over@@ hang &quot; should be constructed . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of the planning is to use the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; &quot; this way we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; in turn led to the roof incl@@ ination , which for energetic reasons - unlike the cultivation plan - should lie below 10 degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the cultivation plan for the roof incl@@ ination does not permit &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ese Municipal Council is usually more restri@@ ctive when it comes to liber@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in turn , this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected by school and adult education .
&quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ meter large hall is now presented to the Board of Directors . &quot;
clinic Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the hospital in Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of staff moved from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this applies to the Supervisory Board , and the Supervisory Board conven@@ es on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work . &quot;
the vast majority should be moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the more existing inside station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play with the question of who was willing to take the lead from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means an &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for p@@ ac@@ emaker and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ator .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the In@@ ner Station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , Fischer will work with his team if the supervisory board agrees to both houses , until then next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app , which has more than 35 beds , is to be finally closed in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the administrative district has planned this for 2018 when the currently ongoing refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital has been completed . &quot;
&quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ rat , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I simply shut off . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and an iat@@ ro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity will not come again , &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which had been accepted by the employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where Fischer worked as chief physician for over 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; in recent decades , the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) has repeatedly been threatened by closure , departments have been closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded tonight ( 8.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Mountain@@ dog HC .

two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in action , as the police claimed . &quot;

missing 16 year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspic@@ ious suspic@@ ious has led the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
&quot; in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
an 16 year old missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to violent crime .
&quot; the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the prosecution and the police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old was also suspected of being active on Tuesday evening , who reported in fact the statement and the investig@@ ator led to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home after a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen after visiting an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; when looking for the young woman , investig@@ ators first bite the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the arrest stated in police inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and put the body into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was supposed to be brought forward on Wednesday at the port fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ators put an eye on him . &quot;
conclusions about the near@@ er circumstances of action shall bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many major cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; &quot; con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; to compare this year , 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus , 14@@ 0,000 homes are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first reception . &quot;
many come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment rentals .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , last year , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent . &quot;
&quot; the negative development of the housing market , however , is not limited to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes considerable om@@ issions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany moves up an apartment deficit from year to year .
&quot; currently , some 77@@ 0,000 units have already been missing in the metropol@@ itan areas , said Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many of the working people lived in large towns not@@ ated in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ willing to stay longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the flies on the housing market .
&quot; in the large cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a has declined for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
new incentives for housing construction should be revi@@ ved .
&quot; in this way , the purchase tax will be wai@@ ved and the foundations for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the Alliance . &quot;
the subsi@@ dy programme for the recei@@ vers of the Kf@@ W is already well received by cities and municipalities .
&quot; on Monday evening , a good week after the launch , more than half of the available around 300 million euros have been called up on Monday evening . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free travel : Croatia and Slovenia establish a corridor
&quot; there is practically no passage to Hungary , as more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; Zagreb announces that transit through Slovenia to the north , without hur@@ dles . &quot;
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring country Slovenia about setting up a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian interior minister and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after sealing off the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television station RT@@ L . &quot;
&quot; on the eve of the day , Hungary sailed its border for refugees . &quot;
&quot; new laws , which entered into force on the same day , practically make decent asylum procedures in Hungary practically superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; they can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the Serbian Border at the border of Serbia . &quot;
&quot; most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came with both the bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after arrival , they would have tried to get to Croatia on foot via the green border . &quot;
&quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not meet border guards . &quot;
there are other dangers involved : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a secure passage .
&quot; in Hungary , however , after the closure of the border no more refugees arrive . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police killed 3@@ 66 people . &quot;
shortly before the closing ceremony on Monday there were still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the overcoming and damage of the Grenz@@ z@@ a@@ uns as a crime .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
the condemned sentences handed down to five years and the deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; Tran@@ sitz@@ onen &quot; on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly persons . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there would have been 40 refugees there . &quot;
&quot; practically , nobody has a prospect of obtaining asylum granted in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to clean up .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barrier screens were disman@@ tled and one of the wareh@@ ouses in the border town was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the aim of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , only a few refugees arrive . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; 20,000 migrants were still staying in the country according to government figures . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for the further journey to Germany . &quot;
the train from there to Germany was hal@@ ted by the German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly . &quot;
mayor ro@@ de &quot; str@@ and@@ ete &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday with the ti@@ dying up when suddenly ten people were standing with touring coaches at the entrance to the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to go to Pass@@ au by train . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany was un@@ expect@@ edly set off on Sunday because of the flow of refugees with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and cut the fr@@ inge together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars crossed the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before we left the unexpected guests only once , with refresh@@ ment and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said immediately , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man could not take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; we were very happy , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers were switched on Sunday evening in W@@ els by ICE to a regional train in the direction of Pass@@ au , in order to make it after the short notice that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still to try to cross the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was put off at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the bridge festival with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able on Sunday , a second bridge spor@@ tily - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends another Z@@ ig@@ nia to us , is a logical result of an apparent policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in order to help the establishment of structures , our Chancellor has officially moved up the position of the Hungarian government into the sphere of national socialism . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ oultry will find that the &quot; promised land , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; there will be a great challenge facing the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , in order to produce decent conditions for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 3@@ 5,000 winter@@ proof quartz &quot;
Konrad lived with the refugee teaching all hands full .
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to establish districts for thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos at the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen headquarters .
&quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told about his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees , who had come to Austria on Monday , was without major vor@@ tices , said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; master power . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 tonnes in a he@@ ur@@ igen year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are supposed to provide the countries , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; Konrad said . &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial govern@@ ors .
&quot; they would have assured him , even for the coming refugees Qu@@ arti@@ ere . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to clarify how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum co @-@ ordin@@ ator sets great expectations also in the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping how we &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , private persons can easily offer accommodations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they are hoping for hotels that are vac@@ ant in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of need , it cannot be that mer@@ c@@ ers must hold a certain height of the towel holder or size of the duties . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary time , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the ministry of the Interior , in contrast to the ministry of accommodation , Konrad decides with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further face to fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er don &apos;t cause the republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their head@@ count by three to four .
&quot; up to now , your own quest has not been successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container on the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better distribution
&quot; there is no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings , such as tips Arena and Design Center for refugees &apos; accommodation plans the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since the persons concerned are currently without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , other locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
criticism exercises the boss on the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
also other districts need to make their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has been accused of further action in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German limits are not regulated .
the further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there are now the respective border controls . &quot;
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
&quot; however , the seek@@ ers would be transferred to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger called for more enhanced solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , Austria is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; in Linz &apos;s industrial line is officially closed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is set up , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine investing in startup companies of the Neue Wer@@ ft and later to acquire them .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; € 1.7 million has been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million Euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of rest area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are en@@ quiries . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the arcade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focal point of the new shop .
&quot; actually , Jutta Br@@ eit was willing to buy a dog . &quot;
the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni had to move into the do@@ ve market in the do@@ ve market : finally she got a growth in the form of another business location .
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop where they sold bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and garments of various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to € 500 .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; before that , several weeks have been modified . &quot;
&quot; but I long thought about whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; for the decision , among other things , the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the big space Linz , who sell this stamp , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has given Br@@ eit from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so some woman , when seeing a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , can &apos;t answer the professional woman with the last safety . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag de@@ valu@@ ates every outfit .
the Me@@ et@@ jes@@ us from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
&quot; this property also connects people with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants to become . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for set @-@ ups .
&quot; whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself alien@@ ation , repor@@ ters are concerned or gaps in international crisis policies - the candidate for the U.S. presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign power@@ fully . &quot;
and cuts well with it .
&quot; this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire came from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the hair @-@ hair@@ style is a term for many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf an der Wein@@ straße .
some in the 1200 @-@ habit@@ ant place is related to him over -@@ zig ver@@ tices .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ stadt Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous s@@ ap@@ lings , among which besides Tr@@ ump the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz is among them . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt ( 2014 ) , so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is a bit a big mau@@ l , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the nickname of the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ us &quot; &quot; - to Hoch@@ german : the gi@@ ver , says it . &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the gi@@ vers .
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold graves in the USA . &quot;
the corn@@ erst@@ one of the property group was first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time , failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared film start . &quot;
&quot; ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the building of a boundary wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the Polish , it is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative of his m@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks rather dist@@ ancing the Americans , &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ ittle . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; I cannot imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pen@@ sion@@ ist Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ at a visit , which was generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he did not win the election because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the collar at the time of his grandfather in the USA , would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter , Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , which was inter@@ viewed for a long time , attracted 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ at@@ singers , also in the USA watches the interest . &quot;
the Upper Bavaria district of Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; Mountain@@ eering village . &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 resident village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park was awarded the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; may have more than 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the ratings despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the liber@@ als &apos; leadership , but there are no major shifts in Today &apos;s reviews . &quot;
the breakfast show by N@@ ine was aired by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; Riv@@ ale Sun@@ rise , with moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the board seemed to play no part for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise posted an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 viewers among the five capitals in comparison with today 33@@ 9,000 . &quot;
&quot; today there was a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
&quot; in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 was running . &quot;
&quot; up to now Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ 9,000 viewers in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are okay , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial enst@@ ar by Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama of a recently swe@@ ating father who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million spectators . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could wear a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and struck lightly The Block ( 83@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL famili@@ al ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e showed an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in half an hour . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; the drop in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia , N@@ ine will be confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m. &quot;

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret unveiled ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; finally , the woman , when Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was covered in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you may acci@@ dentally have given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood delivers his lips to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women are in ly@@ rical ways of why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; could become their answers to the game @-@ destro@@ yer who won the core of the Bachel@@ ors . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and realized ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible and I thought it was in the whole course of the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit of the house last week made her clear that &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose whom wood should choose , if not she , then she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30@@ h . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ nes had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some coaches could have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game when he lost a sc@@ ram@@ ble as he did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also into the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged her . &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ nes in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t in a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first game quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings &quot;
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian team had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; after the F@@ um@@ ble , Hay@@ nes left the field and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ nes said . &quot;
Hay@@ es compared the car@@ ver with its Orig@@ in debut then in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al range led to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; because of the high refugee numbers , the Free voters are calling for the setting of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the FW @-@ Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sur in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and frac@@ tion@@ ist Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect the schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get fault in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Free voters &quot; parliament postpon@@ ed until Friday in the under @-@ Frank@@ ish Commun@@ e .
&quot; actually , quite different main topics were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free voters meeting .
&quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it gave during the 1990 &apos;s wars . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot;
asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative courts in charge of asylum requests : &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the FW @-@ chief critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards for federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria anim@@ ates , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more powerful . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional policy is not to fall under the table in the city of Wielkopolska . &quot;
a lon@@ gl@@ asting standing tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , French Minister Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Central Level plus , &quot; where an extension of the secondary upper secondary level will be tested for three to four years - in the result it will take nine years to finish . &quot;
but that does not go far enough .
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the FW boss . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that want that .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax jumps to jumps
&quot; after a long @-@ distance route , the German stock market closed with profits for a long distance . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon , a solid start of the US stock exchanges took a clear direction , which finally promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points upwards . &quot;
&quot; the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values increased 0.@@ 54 per cent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points . &quot;
the technology @-@ based Tec@@ D@@ ax climbed by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 36.@@ 69 points .
&quot; the Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 , as the leading index of the euro area , decreased by 1.01 percent to 320@@ 7.@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid earnings also bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed the London and Paris market places .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in the meantime , the debate about the bur@@ dens arising from the nuclear phase has temporarily de@@ pressed the shares of RW@@ E to record high , and also left on deep marks at E@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot;
the German government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent on the D@@ ax peak .
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the US collector &apos;s magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive effect from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors therefore paid little attention to the German chip maker . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , investments in promising w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off . &quot;
&quot; car values were asked : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August , more cars were dropped again than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Automobile Exhibition IA@@ A in Frankfurt . &quot;
the papers of the automotive Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen assets increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; on the German pension market , the return on listed federal securities was dropped to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.50 ) percent . &quot;
the Re@@ x bond index increased by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Con@@ federation @-@ Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.3 points .
the price of the euro dropped to $ 1.@@ 12@@ 62 in the afternoon .
&quot; at noon , the European Central Bank set the reference rate to € 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) USD . &quot;
the dollar thus cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) Euro .
4 people killed after police officers shoot rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police demonstrated rubber floors in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official on Wednesday said . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , senior district administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and bombs . &quot;
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before res@@ or@@ ting to rubber floors .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used by those who are known to kill them , which are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , evi@@ dently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ our@@ i say that new provinces , formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal by the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been governed centrally for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator ha@@ sten@@ ed the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
area planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Youth Centre Old Post shall be restored .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 @-@ square @-@ meter area .
&quot; the plan is a mixture of trade , business and living - concrete offers are not yet available . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market a approx . 4000 square meter site in direct neighbourhood to the Old Post youth center .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the grounds for a mix of trade , commercial and living . &quot;
&quot; waiting for corresponding offers , it is said on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor would come into question is not yet clear .
&quot; however , no contracts were signed in accordance with this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner of the Great street , already a few months ago and the building had to be torn down . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
plans for the agriturismo on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented public plans for the project for the first time .
many tra@@ ilers are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure tour
&quot; for months behind closed doors was negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday cottage on the small sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the interest , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot;
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day .
&quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , who accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends on the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market .
&quot; violent reactions to the owners of Meer@@ bus@@ en , who had come to the meeting , ev@@ oked the images and new details of the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , mer@@ gers and board member representing the interests of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a huge cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears , like several other project critics , that the traffic would strongly increase due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; there must be whole bus@@ ses coming so that it pays , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what exactly is happening on the well one hect@@ are of the former inn , however , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator anymore .
&quot; first we need to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this was still lacking , the development plans were still variable . &quot;

Google starts publishing donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donation campaign to help to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that have over@@ tax@@ ed the thousands of refugees that have over@@ tax@@ ed the European nations , since they escape from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the don@@ or &apos;s call on its blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus trips , hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds raised to $ 5.5 million to a share of $ 5.5 million are doubled to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely due to the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many escaped from the Afghanistan war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly over@@ weight diab@@ etics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too soon to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial about the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity therapy , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb nutrients .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes treatment , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are regarded as obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity therapy - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric hos@@ epi@@ - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I under those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition dissolved completely and partially at 28 % . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; moreover , the results of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better found in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood level of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ c@@ emic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year the B@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the ga@@ stro @-@ rec@@ tom@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs 5.1 ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study has no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who under@@ went obesity treatment , about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit to the survival of the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney illness , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone adds that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting for too long to take people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story in H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a subject that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel seems to be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because it plays in Lang@@ wei@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional author was raised in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot record all the refugees , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama , and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama talked about the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford which devot@@ es himself to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria to cope with the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries can be created , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we need to think about how killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama said the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the violent response of the US drag@@ ged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after 11 September , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put on violence and this has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in taking of hands @-@ on dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the USA report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years that swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand san@@ iti@@ zer , so Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Georgia Po@@ ison Centre Director , the cases of revenues of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under the age of 12 reported to the poison control centres , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants inten@@ tionally while some do it to impress their friends , or because of a test in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how te@@ ens dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people have said to have mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic m@@ outh@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children . &quot;
hand san@@ iti@@ zer contained somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in small children , few jumps can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is most concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 channel in kan@@ sa city . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p of whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children get it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had four squ@@ ir@@ ks of straw@@ berry sc@@ ented hand san@@ iti@@ zer in school , was brought to an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; your blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is required by an adult legally as drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ enti@@ sted her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of brain trau@@ ma , since the girl fell through the alcohol and had cast her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ aan &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended both parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hands @-@ on dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were linked to deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities &apos; staff hypoth@@ es@@ ises that the product contains meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which has been listed as a substance . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York were planning to poison their &quot; mil@@ dly &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; the police scrut@@ in@@ ized the tel@@ eg@@ ram plan as &quot; &quot; dex@@ ter@@ ity &quot; &quot; and instruc@@ ted disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

former rank @-@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they don &apos;t show highlights from the Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
you can talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of excitement in the Old Firm gaming games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;

&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel exactly the same - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the player better . &quot;

&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the UK@@ s of 5.5 percent , as shown by the figures from the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;

it &apos;s almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .

why I will be witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; something later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison@@ ous sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
&quot; the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew ni@@ gh , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists should be allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and as often more applications are available as places , there is a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery instead of deciding who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will see it emotion@@ less .
I cannot .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; could have been better form@@ ulating &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after Barry Van Tre@@ ese assass@@ ination would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I &apos;m sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy says ste@@ wards were trying to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
&quot; Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year , threatening to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he zi@@ pped on the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claiming that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ tu@@ bu@@ d test at Li@@ dar@@ i which he cannot explain .
he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I pret@@ ended to say nothing about it and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot;
they know it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I &apos;d like to walk up@@ lifted main , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; before Moo@@ dy had made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy out his barn . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Terr@@ y Bail@@ ey , Day@@ ton Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - which I will name when I am asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing inside my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy to rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly put themselves in their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ le@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to think that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave and do people outside of coaches are responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and rep@@ el me , and I have no doubt that what I say they now think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I am now at the point where that doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training levels of the trainer are based on the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he &quot; &quot; could throw his licence on the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ disputed master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race tags treatment rule &quot; &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has mistakenly applied mud to the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
&quot; it could have been the whole day , which was so . &quot;
but it had also been on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the day of the race . an examination of this affair has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot;
man after driver &apos;s flight arrested
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ram . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy back against rival claims to ring fight
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has described criticism at the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; agenda setting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster &apos;s coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires allowed the Storm players to have &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high storm trophy in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a barely conce@@ aled comment to the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the tor@@ ch of his team and said that at the Tac@@ kling machine , they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team would confi@@ dently agree that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; that appears again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson replied about ring@@ fights when she beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but over the last six weeks , we have made our contact with tac@@ kles into a real focus , and this has yiel@@ ded the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously he has a great team to train . &quot;
it is strange as this always appears again at this time of the year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a bull@@ sh@@ it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we regard as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like them . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to have to play against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they probably didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against Roo@@ sters reached a higher score than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are breaks made , and are not points something exciting ? &quot;
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
the Storm Team is free at this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; serving beer with 200,000 $ deposit after drug addiction &quot;
&quot; a man who could possibly have a lifetime sentence due to his attempt to get into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , who were sm@@ ug@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite a possibly viable sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that he could have been in the café for a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he stated to the Court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in case of a criminal complaint , he lied to the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had a security deposit of 200,000 dollars in common to achieve their release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ ent declarations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Richter Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to stop him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and Ser@@ b passport and stops at the police daily and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
A5 on A5 at Karlsruhe : leader &apos;s house tear apart apart
&quot; at a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the Autobahn 5 at Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver has been seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks participated in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried v@@ ain@@ ly to turn left at the last moment as the police interven@@ ed .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing plan completely separated .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from 6 hours to 2 am .
&quot; there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 Euro . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ oph@@ ile to sending pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ ist used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when this slept , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of decent pictures of children that were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the dor@@ man@@ t H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; Web resear@@ ches &quot; , &quot; which used terms to search for in@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , since it would lead to &quot; &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile on the internet &quot; &quot; and he &quot; &quot; pret@@ ended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to pret@@ end to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures , and he asked to send even more photos . &quot;
he said he did so to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wants pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she also saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Play@@ station used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he was .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment to have received un@@ decent pictures of children on the 14th of June this year , and did not appear before the court hearing a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ate Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g did not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , as one could argue that &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; in his off@@ ence is to be found . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael sp@@ ends the verdict until October to get background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted security deposit in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings of other pending cases . &quot;
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the judgment .
locks ev@@ ade on small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the large control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ d@@ houses left people on smaller border cross@@ ings because of fear of discovery and arrest .
&quot; out on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the river Inn river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn area since Tuesday . &quot;
they were on foot over bridges and def@@ ences to the German side .
&quot; there , they are received by federal police and rel@@ ayed to the registration . &quot;
&quot; at Munich Hauptbahnhof ( Munich Main Station ) , more refugees arrived on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week . &quot;
&quot; at 8@@ am alone , some 700 people have arrived in the provincial capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ establishment of inspec@@ tions at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city . &quot;
&quot; Stuttgart : bo@@ gie of tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against storm holes in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm ocean air flows into the country , divided by the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the strong low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic over the past few days . &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground @-@ seek@@ er with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 hour kilometers . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the mass is doing it : every two years the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IA@@ A .
2015 is above all moving to the compact cars that are currently particularly well sold .
cars from the compact class are particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment alone in August alone .
this is reflected in the IA@@ A ( Public Days September 17 @-@ 27 ) .
&quot; between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at retailers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive either . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in prospect , starting at € 17 650 . &quot;
the current Astra will cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra has a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ essi@@ ans offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are also among the first . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a fifth . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which can also be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will be done next to the Astra at the IA@@ A still on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen only as a fifth in a conventional and an acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT @-@ version . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , he also served as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; with the new model , the Nissan emul@@ ator will be able to find its position in the strongly growing segment . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adap@@ ts to the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will receive a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the bal@@ eno in Europe in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n collector laid the front part in front of everything : here the radiator grill was newly drawn and the changed head@@ lamps equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants at the IA@@ A in the compact class , such as the refurbished Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court granted an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary School Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells . &quot;
this decided the Federal Constitutional Court on a decision issued on Wednesday .
those affected can even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; with this , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally un@@ separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on free foot , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his claim of office because of the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the country Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the judges highlighted the verdict of the Berlin Court of Appe@@ als and rejected the case for re @-@ examination . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber court now decides on the level of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons of the question@@ able period only a few days of prison days for compensation are author@@ itative , a compensation claim was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; rub@@ bing the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of compensation .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; so they spoke only in April of an in@@ mate , because he was locked in prison naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision by 2011 , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple occupation of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which in@@ filtr@@ ated a decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
the former plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have come into the head@@ lines because of lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; therefore , prisoners are imprisoned again and again for 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to kill them because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Jus@@ tiz@@ enship Office 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to young workers , 19 are to be om@@ itted in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to the German Federal Ministry of Education , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to the vice @-@ Chancellor of Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even capable of recording a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to different forecasts between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the German Federal Ministry of the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) apartments each year - and the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up until now ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; dramatic is the lack of living space , but especially in affordable rental properties : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing is out of the rental price bond , and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion of 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , scientists and federal government ministers agree that there will also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them start their careers , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but the integration of refugees is crucial if they find work in Germany .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political change in Germany : from prohibition of work to refugees for the recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the residence lights , asylum seek@@ ers restricted to a residence . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
&quot; until now , there is still no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most common through personal contacts .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Administration has stated that only a handful of parents give their children to the kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the u@@ pro@@ oted parents it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ dab@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ books in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the demand for educ@@ ators is growing strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of education - roughly by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students are prepared without any knowledge of German in welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ carrying from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle no federal land prohibited asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its stance . &quot;
prepar@@ atory refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a permit or Dul@@ ce do not receive services according to the asylum seek@@ er law , if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the latter will not get a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g because they do not fall under the circle of the authorised persons . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this funding gap must also be closed , ask Steffen Kra@@ ie , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely move to Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state @-@ churches law will further develop into a new state religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is also important to establish an Islamic welfare association , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give him certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to leave such conflicts in Germany immediately left their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law on Arab .
integration will continue to be a topic for the whole of society in future .
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more urgent . &quot;
&quot; Germany , as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination point and a general gender equality law for a decade now . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U assass@@ ination series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the same opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organizations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German have long been asking for and why international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany must become reality in the coming years , if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the good of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical treatment to the expected refugees , &quot; says Doctor President , Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must be incorporated into the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to balance all newcom@@ ers equally with the registration of health cards . &quot;
services rendered could be expected to be deduc@@ ted later by the federal states .
&quot; and in the long run , it is highly question@@ able to send as many people with the limited power catalogue , which the asylum seek@@ ers act act . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors make the language barrier clear . &quot;
&quot; already so far , the Berlin Health Scienti@@ st The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over . &quot;
many refugees were also helped by more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; with the partially other illnesses of the disease , German doctors came from their training , but clear , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; and what concerns the shortage of doctors is by the refugees even allevi@@ ation in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly again cover ex@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill , according to estimates of the Federal Pen@@ al Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or under depression . &quot;
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder , among other things , suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with difficulty breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration difficulties , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms would be chronic , an early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically sick refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although mentally ill seek@@ ers in the social offices can apply for a psych@@ otherapy application , however , processing takes usually several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , cler@@ ks or doctors , who are not educated for mental illnesses , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on the bar and was@@ en to dream .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Animal Teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the actual generation of the goats . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the Circus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
&quot; thus , the gift to spiritu@@ alists lies in the blood of the family . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to remove people from their everyday life and take them in a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ enco@@ der tail with cosm@@ opol@@ itan flair &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities on the less than 3,000 kilomet@@ re long tour can now experience this flair . &quot;
the cir@@ cus program impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family pul@@ ls the audience with w@@ it and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of silent movies , the Cuban duo wants to easily record . &quot;
ease and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art on the mast is meant to capture women &apos;s hearts by storm .
&quot; apart from numerous laugh@@ ing sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger tips and artic@@ ulations . &quot;
to balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
ape @-@ to@@ ed people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little else and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve countries offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there are only too many gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses only too often in various animal protection organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we do not go well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , will be read by the eyes every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to be in the arena . &quot;
the upper@@ most commandment : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in a habitat and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; for each visitor , something is likely to be there . &quot;
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; no matter if five or one hundred spectators , we always give our best and are there with all my heart . &quot;
&quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst starts from September 17 to 20 , daily at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. on his performances . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm . &quot;
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5@@ pm the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe comm@@ its wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , desc@@ ended from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread through the social media . &quot;
the opening of the parliament was also comfor@@ ted by the opposition of the opposition members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with bu@@ y@@ levels .
&quot; last month , they had denied him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
spokes@@ man for movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their phones that they warned against Mr. Mu@@ gabe address .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity in the Parliament will end and once they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the spokes@@ man said that the party headed by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25.000 to 30.000 jobs as part of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service business activities . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses supporting companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as a stand @-@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever before , to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will focus on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says the company . &quot;
it spl@@ its a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to produce electro @-@ systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage one called the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has passed a massive restructuring to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that closely focused companies perform better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September , and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot;
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of his story his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he previously had .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknow@@ le@@ dges , there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study by Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that in six out of eight game times , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most vulner@@ abilities . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win martial @-@ power , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger poses a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not traveled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are allowed to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need to get a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , being measured on the Richter scale of 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the apprenticeship in the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope , with his management to lead the club to his first European victory . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
&quot; Friend@@ ship Fest : the comedy show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships &quot;
&quot; the absence of similar shows in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever had been proven , as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged between 20 and 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 announced the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms revealed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends first of all so that a friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call extr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire declared recently , money can really not buy . &quot;
the Schön@@ e at Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality influenced by interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments of football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even though they are often restra@@ ined to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of phone care , I explained : ... &quot; my audi@@ ble role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I cope with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status over the telephone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship Fe@@ ast with the scenery completely re@@ designed to celebrate the day , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be broadcast at Com@@ edy Central from the beginning - the total 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his match against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; in his debut , di Maria meets in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö at the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria made less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards she missed a number of occasions before she finally raised her head when Cav@@ ani reached a head office in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Masters as it does not only seek the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced with his home town team and against the association with which he started his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and look back even if there are certain things that we need to perfect over the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret not having scored one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury that was able to hold a 2 : 2 Draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was pier@@ ced by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was referred to as the man that can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why when he ended up in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , before he completed Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who beat Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ op@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was excited with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ app &apos;s posts in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes arose , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was only scrat@@ ched in the first half in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had deployed it after re@@ bo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who turned the Di Maria into a shot , which was led by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ... &quot;
&quot; the second goal finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus , the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans claimed his sixth season gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ aded a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; that ended all thoughts that Malm@@ ö can return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result could be low before substitute players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi reached a goal at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which does not have the same level .
the qualification matches are not sufficient . &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore collects $ 2.5 billion through stock sales
&quot; the Mining @-@ Ri@@ ese Gl@@ enc@@ ore , based in Switzerland , which is affected by collap@@ sing commodity prices , collected $ 2.5 billion by a stock sales as part of its huge debt rep@@ ay@@ ment plan . &quot;
&quot; the Gl@@ enc@@ ore , registered in London , said in an explanation that it sold new shares amoun@@ ting to about 1.6 billion pounds , in order to pay off their own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , fights with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses the demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
the issue of subscription rights brought Gl@@ en@@ cores share price at the early Wednesday morning a rapid increase to the tip of the London stock market .
&quot; the share jump@@ ed by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
Gl@@ enc@@ ore announced last week the 2.5 billion US stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around a third of its 30 billion $ debts .
&quot; the company sold the new shares to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion common shares of up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
&quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices decreased by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , axis of first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and replies president Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner , after the two leaders have bilateral talks . &quot;
&quot; President xis visits will offer the opportunity to extend the American @-@ Chinese collaboration with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi addressed the possibility to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , which was announced at first in February , will probably meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber sp@@ ying in China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world@@ - and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who was then playing for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times winner champion , four times champion @-@ league winner , two times champion @-@ champion , two times champion @-@ champion , two times champion champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi adm@@ its that he was already out of Barcelona before the European Championship .
they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we did nothing , &quot; he says . &quot;
and this also recorded FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern . &quot;
guar@@ ola was the reason X@@ avi changed not
but the change did not occur .
and the decisive man for this is today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how to run Bay@@ erns &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi was standing for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the whole distance on the grass , folded the Red Army ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican filmm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; as a result of the Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ Light , experienced actor Brown interrupted when he emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives , in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen script . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with off@@ ended un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian strengthened . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers , in order to discuss the show fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the character of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said at first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a n@@ ap , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People settled for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing right at the film ; Dam@@ on replied that &quot; &quot; in the end , their direction &quot; &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Mr Po@@ oni &apos;s Twitter user expressed his anger about the clip saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its diversity - this is SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , Black Li@@ ves Matter was nation@@ ally affected and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to enjo@@ in discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured immigrants . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a recording on the movement during the introduction of nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; &quot; ( albums always have their meaning ) &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums always have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , Black Li@@ ves Matter has published a statement in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the Black Li@@ ves Matter is a love group , &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ers who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crowned first champion
Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prize of $ 1 Million .
&quot; the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season of the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
&quot; to the last task , climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was included in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten completed the task at the time when he was the first ath@@ lete , who finished the exhau@@ sting Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge three seconds faster , making him a winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Big Prize of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deser@@ ved or had any more than $ 10,000 , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot;
so quite suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer , K@@ ent We@@ ed , sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , the one gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll complain about it any more .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
crowds of awards he received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m happy that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior has been extended for an eighth season , the filming will begin in the spring of 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; previously , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 at Target Field . &quot;
the T@@ wins w@@ asted a chance to climb inside a half @-@ half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Ar@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) stroke 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and made three R@@ uns possible .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen of any game , and so I want to go quite concentrated into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ guard Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first r@@ bis since the middle of August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit @-@ hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the wood well , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh inst@@ inct , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into the game . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks placed a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted with the designated R@@ ook@@ ie percus@@ sion@@ ist Miguel S@@ ano , who won a two @-@ run two @-@ run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen offered the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat Double Play in this season .
&quot; after det@@ ecting an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inning , Detroit created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and posted the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed thro@@ ws S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit benefited at the beginning of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the game from the injury list after he had been missing more than a month due to a back injury . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; having received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers placed in the second one , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not go well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J. A@@ chter . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three R@@ uns at six hits and a walk with four k@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throw @-@ out shoulder .
&quot; he is being investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the injury @-@ list because of a shoulder @-@ loos@@ ening , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is cancelled by the injury list to start the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30th
he has been missing in the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people who came to it will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden said on Tuesday evening . &quot;
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the h@@ ess@@ ische provincial capital had been prepared for this event in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there .
they shall then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; over the past ten days , according to the government pres@@ idency of the government of the government , 7@@ 500 people arrived in H@@ esse . &quot;
&quot; due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls . &quot;
milit@@ ants in Syria are an option
&quot; the Director of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the decis@@ i@@ vely re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he proposed &quot; collective om@@ ission &quot; to the European states .
&quot; four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military intervention in Germany . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict is crashing on our front door , &quot; he said in Deutschland@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has also introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , but no one was sent back to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , too , no refugees were sent back to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , there have already been discussions between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
they did not call them concrete figures and had discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ therapie from Hungary . &quot;
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU countries have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis .
&quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of more than 120,000 refugees on a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee resistance in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries stronger in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced at the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with Prime Ministers in the Chanc@@ ellery of Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need shelter , get them too . &quot;
but those who don &apos;t have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; . &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees meanwhile stuck on the Bal@@ kan@@ itinerary .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent tu@@ g@@ boats seeking ev@@ asi@@ ve routes across Romania said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , thousands more migrants reported that thousands of migrants were reporting on their way to the Greek border . &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ tail of the Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sw@@ apped a global ocean .
this is what researchers conclude from observations of the &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; room probe .
&quot; accordingly , the Moon stag@@ gered easily on its track around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; this do@@ ve movement is only small but still too big for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it says in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) of Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the specialist paper &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
&quot; even longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in 2006 , Cass@@ ini had discovered ice volcan@@ oes on the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon which sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and therefore feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , astronom@@ ers closed at that time . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden oceans was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 Munich must ren@@ ounce a month on offen@@ sives Val@@ det R@@ ama .
the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old gave an investigation into an investigation .
R@@ ama had already filed a complaint at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis &quot; is expected to mean four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ edi@@ tary loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we must now reflect , &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a non @-@ professional pro@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , the Six@@ ties initially presented a Def@@ en@@ siv@@ mann . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after his conc@@ ussion , the goal hunter Ru@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training next week . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had hurt his head in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) .
&quot; contrary to the first app@@ reh@@ en@@ sions , he remained without a severe bli@@ ster . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy sweet .
&quot; but he who wants to take care of his slender line , often rather dis@@ cour@@ ages from them . &quot;
man@@ gan@@ ese contain relatively large amounts of sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gan@@ os contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits thus supports vision , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant . &quot;
peel color alone does not tell how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ go can taste very tasty .
they should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or sweet foods .
&quot; a man@@ go , but also sav@@ our@@ y dishes , gives a special touch . &quot;
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

&quot; the US parcel service U@@ PS will again provide up to 95@@ 9,000 subsidies for Christmas business in the United States . &quot;
&quot; the company already started the recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS shared on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are being sought .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce by 95@@ 0,000 hel@@ pers for the holiday season . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming on @-@ line business , U@@ PS and its competi@@ tor Fed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed delivery of parcel services had introduced harsh criticism . &quot;

on Wednesday and on the night to Thursday the fo@@ ehn is partly blowing through the gro@@ aning valleys .
&quot; after gro@@ aning on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind bows and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently facing an extensive deep @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west flow . &quot;
on the alpine side of the Alps it breaks through the valleys in the night to Wednesday .
&quot; as a consequence , the F@@ öh@@ n blows up until Thursday morning in the fi@@ r @-@ valleys with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally also with more than 100 km / h especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öh@@ n can move in places to the adjacent centre of Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains , even or@@ can ar@@ cs of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my F@@ öh@@ n ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moisture can be st@@ owed on the Alpine hill@@ side . &quot;
rain is made here that lasts until Thursday evening .
&quot; total must be expected south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , with some 100 litres of rainf@@ all per square meter , which has already fallen large quantities of rain during the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , the air enters the air . in the episode rolling a cold front with powerful , partially swe@@ ating rain from west to east across Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front , the wind bri@@ gh@@ tens up to stor@@ my temperatures and temperatures drop significantly . &quot;
&quot; the following days are presented in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend , with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of City President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the work community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , the pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live in sec@@ rec@@ y for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the square becomes visible that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) found himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he found the city as a promising sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; according to historians , his negative impressions are likely to have reinforced him in his later fight against Rome . &quot;

hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with gorgeous images . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means in@@ significant with &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adjusted to the respective themes , that can be quite dark . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project about three years for which he made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
&quot; cycles have been created which dev@@ ote themselves to topics like cr@@ us@@ ades , pl@@ agues , commandments , or fa@@ ther@@ hood . &quot;
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare H@@ og@@ an Lov@@ ells
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the Scrip@@ tures on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages chosen by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today , into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror by Al@@ ts Pain@@ ting .
they are embedded between the original Bible commentary by Martin Luther and a set of the artist who form@@ ulates his very personal thoughts on the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately triggered for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant sovereign Order . &quot;
&quot; since education already happened with the cane , &quot; Oth@@ mar &apos;s old re@@ members . &quot;
I tried to work up so that I might also be able to reconc@@ ile myself with the Lord &apos;s Father .
&quot; his second concern is to reg@@ ain art again in fast @-@ lived time : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is marked by advertising today , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being supp@@ ressed .
artists have a different lust and bl@@ iss to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to fall into the pictures , let them look , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art to be : &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I have not taken care of cap@@ turing the Bible completely , but selected the most important , also mysterious subjects for him . &quot;
&quot; this was not co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text only elu@@ ci@@ dates . &quot; &quot;
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare H@@ og@@ an Lov@@ ells
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and of responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15 . &quot;
commen@@ cement of construction for BM@@ X
&quot; a year later , almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was finished . &quot;
&quot; failures in politics and administration were responsible for casting , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill looked down , looking for new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval was received in October , the First Municipal Ad@@ visor Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will be even more visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear mark on the weekend . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; football is responding to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and ensures that politicians get help in cop@@ ing with the problems they face . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that is nothing to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am the next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football can and may help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must put the policy .
&quot; for this reason , the German Football Association has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years . &quot;
&quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation ensures that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; stated Nier@@ sbach on the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some federal li@@ gi@@ sts support this program .
&quot; already this weekend , the 36 professionals will set a clear sign if they will be wearing the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor &apos;s logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said L@@ ever@@ kus@@ ens Sports Director Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a &quot; matter of course . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , nobody should take it away . &quot;
&quot; we can use football feder@@ ations , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so unbeliev@@ ably , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ offen@@ heim , Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig , spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the EM qualification match against Hungary this Friday , the national team of the women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Nier@@ sbach indicated the support of refugees as &quot; a large community network of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 licensed packages in their locations would have started their own projects , be great . &quot;
just as great is that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; that we have spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association will provide 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees together with the German Federal Government and the German government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called up the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; Nier@@ sbach reported . &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses sight of accident
&quot; the Executive Board of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , report@@ edly lost the left eye through a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost bloo@@ dless , was power@@ less , then went out to the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ( Thursday edition ) . he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software group .
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the manager of the &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot;
&quot; important is to stand up again , if you fell down . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen ta@@ sted a photo and explained that he suffered the injury than he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; he is therefore just as little as reserve fuel for the two tribe members Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , as one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ table in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes of a com@@ eback by Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europa League have finally broken down . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the football championship leader in the Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be present at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ game against L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its ancest@@ or position on the re@@ us position . &quot;
he announced a change to the grid position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking up the seat of the Roman citizen . &quot;
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the World Champion praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , Tu@@ ch@@ el left whether a turn@@ table in the future is used in all Europa League games . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ging statement by fellow players Re@@ us , that the final decision for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , says Mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for comprehen@@ sible : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot &apos;s cars : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the wake of the German Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , envis@@ ages investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
firm of the Year for Compliance Audi@@ ts and Inves@@ tig@@ ations Gib@@ son Dun@@ n &amp; Cr@@ ut@@ cher Firm of the Year for Corporate G@@ lade Michel Wirt@@ z Firm of the Year for Disp@@ ute Resolution
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic jams , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , which come together with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the road@@ map &apos;s strategy paper emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid change on digital radio . &quot;
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to examine the legal framework conditions &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany wants to use internationally for the per@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 mph . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now sees only the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; are expected to be expected far after 2020 . &quot;

&quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD @-@ transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clear . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;

B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to current status at the title battle of September 25 to October 4 , Dus@@ sel@@ dorf will only hit singles in singles . &quot;
the final decision will be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a great loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without Timo , &quot; said Bundestag President Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM training in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed on sponsor in China . &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are now no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; declared single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which can look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections . &quot;
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; today , I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the pav@@ ement to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; he was actually on the other hand , for : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a little after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously made in Canada Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just fine clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly surprising work of the man who has written fashion story without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; the show is not structured chron@@ ologically , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort was undertaken : in order to refres@@ h the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was specially hired . &quot;
14 tons of material have las@@ hed the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , delicate , fashionable side@@ walks of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and badly in football ) he wore his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the design of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them but of course .
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he couldn &apos;t pay the models . &quot;
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as a fashion hub
&quot; in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make metres . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers , which they used for example for blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Pl@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze fashion has played a major role , it was then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt called a few examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans toward past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , represents an increasing order potential . &quot;
who does not use niche in the textile sector in Germany is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already have half of all orders . &quot;
Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
&quot; today , the mass commodity is made much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively by chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports are weaker , current to Russia and the US . &quot;
ample reasons for new paths .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score by environmental awareness such as Cord@@ ula Bauer from the nitrogen bead in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; this year we have been introducing a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate @-@ designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger branch of the West Saxon University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and sp@@ ik@@ es .
&quot; to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension line between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically , &quot; Schmidt says . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design often only varies slightly to keep a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , the textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ bu@@ ked the historic snow@@ ball top . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine suff@@ oc@@ ates little ch@@ icks in some places . &quot;
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ ths master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ße took their inspiration : &quot; &quot; before , I could not do anything with the traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball point for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the subject of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and who want a souvenir . &quot;
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador for the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney is still vent@@ uring into a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it is not about a re @-@ film , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magical girl girl . &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already certain : Rob Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI aims to open the economy more broad@@ ly to the world
&quot; the economy must open wide to the outside to boost growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group who was tas@@ ked with the reform of the reform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and pushing forward reforms will bring about new imp@@ etus and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a neg@@ atives list for the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the resident system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is created , which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is tested gradually and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it assign@@ s the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guaranteeing a law @-@ based business environment and open the market , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen up controls over the powers transmitted to companies and ensure that companies decide how they manage their business . &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open up government controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of the lawyers to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ ash participated as reported in a statement issued after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cury @-@ limit value in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large predat@@ ory fish and to allow consumers to dose significantly higher dose of the tox@@ in .
&quot; the Food@@ watch consumer organization , which has a corresponding working paper of the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the agenda : &quot; risks and side effects of inf@@ alli@@ ble industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve center for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large predat@@ ors are already so heavily loaded with mer@@ cury that on the basis of the current limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ eable . &quot;
&quot; in return for this attrac@@ tiveness , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; however , Food@@ Watch called this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ ement@@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low weigh@@ ed that they already comply with the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dious distr@@ action maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a toxic heavy metal which is highly toxic above the food chain in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; already small amounts can particularly cause damage to the nervous system in un@@ born damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is mainly due to coal combustion to the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury per year , two thirds of the total volume in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish , e.g. in the Elbe River , Rhine and Danube was &quot; long and widespread , &quot; quoted the &quot; Spiegel &quot; in March from the paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings issued against mer@@ cury in fish already resulted in the most common adverse health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ SF@@ F . &quot;
Food@@ Watch is calling consumers to protest against EU plans on : www.@@ mer@@ cury @-@ reac@@ .@@ food@@ phar@@ .de
