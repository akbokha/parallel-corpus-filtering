&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States , Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organization ) on the other hand &quot;
&quot; according to the GR@@ Ã@@ N@@ DE - a ) The E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action program on the conference for international economic co @-@ operation in order to help the immediate need of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general res@@ sources . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the whole of the Member States will be bound by the agreement within six months , as far as possible within two years after entering into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its possible to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The E@@ EC and the organization have consult@@ ed each other on the proposed execution and administration of this agreement and the middle ties to ensure a broad and balanced ge@@ ographic distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ EC has submitted a table , which is clearly visible in which way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organization is directed to a special account under the name &quot; Special Operations account , &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States shall contribute to the special shar@@ eholder account ; this account is described by the organization as the administrator of tre@@ u@@ gh@@ ed and used ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; administrator &quot; &quot; ) , and only to the purpose of this agreement , and according to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special shar@@ eholder account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are as follows : a ) The payment takes place in the form of cash or un@@ z@@ ins@@ able deb@@ tors of the member state , which are to pay on request in the currency of the respective state to order the organisation as a car@@ et@@ aker of the special tionary account and to be depos@@ ited in the country of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment occurs in two rates , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the amount within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement , or another between the E@@ EC and the administrator at the time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the contribution of the contribution to 1 January 1979 , or at another time , between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) any Member State may claim payment before the afor@@ emen@@ tioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about proportional draw on cash or the deb@@ aker to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and balance the special shareholders account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the guarantee of this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker will be guided according to the following factors : &quot;
III ) to the extent in which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its other lending capacity to loan conditions without any dis@@ advantages ; and
VII ) to the extent that the problems of the countries affected by contributions from other sources can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction loan serves the financing of a clearly transfer@@ able and swi@@ vel@@ ed development program ( including a sect@@ oral priority ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organization financed by the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices prescribed by the organization financed by the organization ( including the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special tionary account may not be used instead of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or Organization . &quot;

special promotions are provided in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this watch are directly to the organization they retain .
&quot; each special transaction loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the means . &quot;
&quot; the income from any special transaction loan can be used for spending in the currency of the recipient country or goods or services , which may be made . &quot;
&quot; capital re@@ payments of special transaction loans are carried out to the special shareholders account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state with@@ drawn after its receipt as soon as possible from the administrator to the relevant Member State . &quot;
the administrator has instruc@@ ted the E@@ EC to complete all special action loan agreement with the directors of the directors in preparation and by the directors approved by directors and programmes .
&quot; during the period of payment of the special transaction loan , the managers instruc@@ ted the E@@ WG quar@@ terly on the development of the loan loan and the expenses paid for this . &quot;

I agree to propose that if your government can agree to the afor@@ emen@@ tioned agreement that this letter and your response letter combined an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this field .
&quot; I instruc@@ t me to set up the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations concerning the import of Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand into the community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a joint market organization for Hamm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat . &quot;
the afor@@ emen@@ tioned amounts are carried out in the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
&quot; the community is assured that New Zealand should not be prevented from using new technological developments , or maintain its competitive position on the market of the community . &quot;
&quot; if a change of the offer form is possible as a result of changes in technology and commerce , the two parties con@@ stituted each other before introducing such changes in clause 10 mentioned above to find an adequate solution . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the goals and conditions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of er@@ ections or other promotion measures for the export of Hamm@@ el - and lamb meat as well as for the s@@ laughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs can only be taken into account with the existing international commitments in accordance with the traditional share of community trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; the Committee regularly checks the tendency on the Hamm@@ el , lamb , and goat &apos;s meat market of both parties and on the global market and the sales conditions on these markets including the conditions that are of importance for this in clause 7 . &quot;
I agree to propose that if your government can agree to the afor@@ emen@@ tioned agreement that this letter and your response letter will form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this field . .
I agree to inform you that my government can agree to the above and that your writing and response letter will form an agreement according to your suggestion .
&quot; in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Eastern Uruguay on the trade with Hamm@@ el , and lamb meat &quot;
&quot; I agree to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set up regulations on import of Hamm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat from Uruguay to the European Economic Community in connection with the use of the joint market organization for sheep and goat meat through the community . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled Hamm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat ( Tari@@ ff 02@@ .01 A IV a ) of the Common Zoll@@ tariff ) ; &quot;
&quot; frozen Hamm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat ( Tari@@ ff 02@@ .01 A IV b ) of the Common Zoll@@ tariff ) . &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export options for Hamm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat from Uruguay will be set up for the following yearly amounts : &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay under@@ takes to ensure that the amount of the agreed amount will not exceed the agreed amount and according to the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; if a change of the offer form is possible as a result of changes in technology and commerce , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before introducing such changes in the number 10 mentioned Committee to find a suitable solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community accepts the protection clause , she ple@@ dges to ensure that the access to this agreement is not affected by the community market . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities , the community reserves the right to expose the imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community is oblig@@ ated to restri@@ ct the exhaus@@ tion of the products collected by this agreement on a set of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the community in consultation with Uruguay will change the quantity of the ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State . &quot;
the import charges for these new Member States will be taken into account in accordance with the provisions of the accession treaty ; this is taken into account under the number 5 stated testi@@ cles of exhaus@@ tion .
the total amount of the total amount is determined by the day of accession of Greece to the community to 5 800 tons of poultry .
the community is under@@ taking everything to avoid a market development that could imp@@ air the marketing ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an Hamm@@ el - and lamb meat on the community market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the community applies precau@@ tions so that the paragraph of intervention resi@@ dues on frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the regulation of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an creativity . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the goals and conditions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of er@@ ections or other promotion measures for the export of Hamm@@ el - and lamb meat as well as for the s@@ laughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs can only be taken into account with the existing international commitments in accordance with the traditional share of community trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of general customs and trade agreements . &quot;
&quot; Uruguay will guarantee compliance with this agreement , in particular , that the quantities of export licenses are issued for the products mentioned in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the community committed itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the provision of import lic@@ ences for the afor@@ emen@@ tioned products is subject to the origin in Uruguay from the template of an export license , which is called on by the ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an government . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the competent ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an authority of the competent authority of the community in regular intervals has been given in regular intervals ; these data may be en@@ coded according to destination country . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the contract is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and according to the agreement of the Treaty on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of China on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time , they remain in force , subject to the right of any party , to termin@@ ate them with a deadline of one year . &quot;

human thorou@@ gh@@ ness is the blood of a healthy person and with a suitable anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans mixed blood .
&quot; C ) that is not free of diseases transmitted by blood trans@@ fu@@ sions , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history . &quot;
&quot; blood removal occurs as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is gli@@ de through a closed , ster@@ ile tube system in a ster@@ ile bottle , in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution was fu@@ elled prior to sterili@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; after completion of the blood removal , the bottle is immediately closed and cool down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . after that , it must be opened immediately before using the blood . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution must not exceed 220 ml per litre of human whole blood , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ation may not drop 97 g per litre . &quot;
the blood group following the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is to determine the blood cells and the ser@@ um ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by examination of the blood cells on a new sample of don@@ ors .

&quot; according to this agreement , blood is intended to be used only for recipients of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group . &quot;
&quot; human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is stored in ster@@ ile , closed bottle from micro@@ organisms and to keep up to its use on a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are only permitted during testing and transport necessary times , which is to cool down to 4 to 6 C . &quot;
a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unity of human thorou@@ gh@@ ness from which the largest part of the plasma has been removed .
&quot; it contains all red blood cells of the unit , from which it has been obtained ; other blood @-@ body components can be present or can be partially removed . &quot;
the liquid content of the concentration is either from the other plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial ins@@ ect solution that has been assigned to the distance of the plasma .
&quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit ) can be applied on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for the production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the fu@@ elling must be carried out using a ster@@ ile , closed system , and only by pressure . &quot;
an artificial ins@@ ect solution has been added to the label as well as its volume and composition .
human drying plasma is extracted through drying of the liquid resulting in cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ ation or sedi@@ mentation of human full flower .
the human dry plasma is extracted by refriger@@ ation or any other method by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of proteins is avoided .
the dry product can easily be dissolved in a water quantity that corresponds to the amount of liquid that is produced in the production of the substance .
&quot; the protein concentration of the obtained solution may not be less than 45 g per litre , and the solution may not have any visible signs of h@@ amm@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;
donations in which ( using a fresh sample ) are a dangerous content of I@@ so@@ h@@ amm@@ ol@@ ys@@ in or immune hem@@ mag@@ gl@@ ut@@ in@@ ine are excluded .
&quot; if plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours after blood removal , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth products in the plasma , blood donations , signs of a bacterial contamination , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the risk of transmitt@@ ing I@@ no@@ cular sh@@ ep@@ atitis , the plas@@ m@@ ec@@ cable mix@@ tures , which are no longer contained than 12 donations , or other methods used to decrease this risk in a comparable manner . &quot;
the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes by 15 to 20 C within 10 minutes .
&quot; a given quantity of plasma is dissolved in the amount of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquid that has been produced , the solution will undergo the following tests : &quot;
&quot; 1 ml solution is a sufficient amount of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or calcium chlori@@ de , so the process can be accelerated in the bro@@ od furnace at 37 C . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ speed drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d under a pressure of no more than 0.0@@ 2 mm mer@@ cury , in the human dry plasma the loss of weight of more than 0.5 % does not occur . &quot;

&quot; if the final product is dried , it must contain at least 950 mg of protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; as a solution , the Group will have a total protein concentration between 45 and 50 g per litre . &quot;
&quot; human Alb@@ um@@ in is produced as a solution , so it must have a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per litre . &quot;
&quot; comparison measurements of viscosity and clou@@ d@@ iness as well as cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ging with the Ultra@@ cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and electro@@ phor@@ esis , which are made before and after heating at the solutions , no signs of den@@ atur@@ ation of the dissolved proteins may arise . &quot;
&quot; after heating up to 57 C and six @-@ stage bulk solids in a mechanical bulk tool , the solution must be completely free of visible particles . &quot;
I ) The fake tests with specific anti@@ sera must show that in both preparations only human plasma rot@@ eins are contained ;
&quot; II ) the electro@@ phor@@ esis is represented by free @-@ floating particles under acceptable and suitable conditions , must show that the protein fra@@ ction which has the flexibility of the alb@@ um@@ component of the normal human plasma has to be at least 95 % and in compounds from human plasma processes at least 85 % of the protein compound . &quot;
&quot; in other preparations from human alb@@ um@@ in and in frac@@ tions of human plasma , the sodium concentration can not exceed 0.@@ 15 mo@@ l per litre of solution or re@@ constructed tro@@ k@@ age preparations . &quot;
the pot@@ assi@@ um concentration of the frac@@ tions from human plasma @-@ map@@ le may not exceed 2 m@@ mo@@ l per litre of solution or recovered dry preparation .

&quot; Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in a solution of human fi@@ br@@ ino@@ gens is set in a solution of the same concentration , such as fresh norm@@ als , must occur outside the double time , which is necessary for the co@@ ag@@ ulation of normal fresh plasma at th@@ rom@@ bin@@ o . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ speed drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d under a pressure of no more than 0.0@@ 2 mm mer@@ cury , the preparation of weight losses over 0.5 % can not occur . &quot;
&quot; after restoration , the final product must prove to be a ster@@ ile method for testing after a suitable bacterial method . &quot;
&quot; human fi@@ br@@ ino@@ gen is in a nitrogen atmosph@@ eres or in air @-@ empty space in ster@@ ile , closed container under exclusion of micro@@ organisms and after possibility of moisture ; it is protected against light and to keep on the recommended temperature . &quot;
&quot; according to the requirements of the don@@ ors , the don@@ ors need to be healthy and particularly free of transfer@@ able diseases based on human dry plasma . &quot;
&quot; in case of refriger@@ ation in plastic bags , the product does not contain any organic sol@@ vents or other foreign substances . &quot;
&quot; the penetration of the walls of plastic bags by such products can be prevented , that the bag is inserted during the whole dip @-@ time in a second and imper@@ me@@ able bag . &quot;
&quot; the risk of dis@@ ruption of the plastic bag during storage in frozen state can be reduced , that each bag is stored in a protective box . &quot;
&quot; the blood is to be centered as cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ gal , that its formed components will soon be removed as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; the addition of the given amount of a suitable solution must cause the total dis@@ solution of dry product in less than 30 minutes at 37 C . small spru@@ ce cl@@ ump , which can be easily separated . &quot;
&quot; in case of storage at 20 C , the preparation is not allowed within three hours after the dis@@ solution . &quot;
&quot; the recovered preparation should contain the specified minimum quantity of VIII , whereby a unit of effectiveness of 1 ml is equivalent to normal fresh plasma ; the efficacy is determined by a method approved by the competent national authority . &quot;
&quot; non @-@ exist@@ ent anti@@ bodies and , if the preparation for patients of a AB @-@ 0 group is determined , a titanium of anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B anti@@ bodies at maximum 1 : 32 . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ stu@@ d drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d under a pressure of no more than 0.0@@ 2 mm of mer@@ cury , the pre @-@ dried preparation of weight losses over 1.5 % does not occur . &quot;
the human factor VIII is in the frozen state at a temperature below - 30 C and in the freezing cold condition under 5 C and protect against light .
&quot; the dri@@ k@@ ken@@ preparation device is in a ster@@ ile atmosphere or in an air @-@ empty space in a ster@@ ile , closed glass bottle under exclusion of micro@@ organisms and after possibility of moisture . &quot;
&quot; the preparation may not be stored in frozen state for longer than six months , in dried state no longer than a year , unless it has been tested for the required minimum effectiveness . &quot;
the label on the preparation contains all information on the corresponding sample label ( Anne@@ x 7 ) .
the don@@ ors must be healthy and particularly free of transfer@@ able diseases based on human dry plasma .
&quot; the final product tested with appropriate methods must be ster@@ ile , ap@@ y@@ che@@ ated and free of undes@@ irable v@@ aso@@ de@@ press@@ ants or respiratory effects . &quot;
the addition of the amount of sol@@ vents is to cause complete dis@@ solution in 10 minutes at 37 C .
&quot; when measuring at 37 C in the presence of a same amount of different solutions of the recovered product , the rec@@ al@@ culation period of a normal plasma is not less than 40 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the recovered product , which is added to the same amount of fi@@ br@@ ino@@ gen ( 3 g / l ) , is not inside within six hours at 37 C . &quot;
&quot; the recovered preparation must contain the specified minimum quantity of factor IX , whereby a unit of effectiveness of 1 ml corresponds to normal fresh plasma ; the efficacy is determined by a method approved by the competent national authority . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ speed drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d under a pressure of no more than 0.0@@ 2 mm mer@@ cury , the product weight loss is not exceeding 1.5 % . &quot;

the contracting parties of the European Convention on 15 December 1958 on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Convention &quot; ) -
&quot; based on article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention , which &quot; &quot; the contracting parties take all the necessary measures &quot; , &quot; to liber@@ ate the therapeutic substances of human origin from all the entrance fees ; &quot;
&quot; in considering that for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this exemp@@ tion into the jurisdiction of the community , which has been established by which it has been founded , has the necessary authority ; &quot;
&quot; in the consideration that it is necessary to carry out the article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention , that the European Economic Community may become the contracting party of the Convention . &quot;
the Convention enters into force for the Community on the first day of the month that follows the signing .
&quot; on the first day of the month , it will take effect on the day following the last of the contracting parties to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) This additional protocol applies , however , after the exp@@ iry of two years after the time in which it has been adopted , unless one of the contracting parties has a objection to his entry . &quot;
&quot; from this point , a state may not become the contracting party of the Convention without being at the same time to become the contracting party of the additional protocol . &quot;
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council notes the Member States of the Council of Europe to all the States and the European Economic Community every assumption or any objection in the sense of Article 2 and the time of force of this additional protocol pursuant to Article 2 .
&quot; the Secretary General notes the European Economic Community also any action , notification or notification in connection with this Convention . &quot;
&quot; in the consideration that it is highly desirable , if Member States should support each other in the spirit of European solidarity in the procurement of reag@@ ents for blood group determination , &quot;
&quot; in the consideration that these reci@@ pro@@ cal support is only possible if nature and use of these reag@@ ents for blood group determination are submitted jointly by the Member States , and the necessary relief and exemp@@ tions for their import . &quot;
&quot; in the sense of this Convention , the expression &quot; reag@@ ents for blood group determination &quot; &quot; reag@@ ents human , animal , plant and other origin for blood group determination and determination of blood intoler@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; any contracting party can restri@@ ct the application of this Convention on Re@@ ag@@ itation of Human Rights to blood group determination , in the signing of this Agreement or on the consideration of its rati@@ fication , approval or accession certificate . &quot;
the declaration can be taken back at any time by one of the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
&quot; the contracting parties undertake , reag@@ ents for blood group determination against rei@@ mbur@@ sement of the costs of their profit , preparation and carriage as well as the purchase price other parties that need urgent need to have sufficient supplies for their own needs . &quot;
&quot; reag@@ ents for blood group determination are provided only under the condition that no profit is associated , that it is only used for medical purposes only , and only to be delivered by the governments involved . &quot;
each shipment of reag@@ ents for blood group determination is a certificate to add it in accordance with the provisions of the protocol .
&quot; the protocol and its anne@@ xes represent an administrative agreement , which can be changed or supplemented by the governments of the contracting parties . &quot;
the parties will make all necessary measures to free the reag@@ ents provided by other contracting parties to the blood group determination of all input charges .
&quot; they also meet all necessary measures to ensure that these substances , in Article 3 , are quickly and on the short@@ est way . &quot;
the parties shall submit to each other via the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
these areas should be identical with the information contained in Article 6 of the European Convention on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin .
&quot; this agreement lies with the members of the Council of Council for signing up ; they can be contracting party by signing it a ) without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , or &quot;
&quot; this Convention enters into force a month after the day in force , on which three members of the Council signed it according to Article 7 without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval . &quot;
&quot; for each member , this Convention will be signed or rati@@ fied without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , it takes a month after his signing or consideration of the rati@@ fication or approval certificate . &quot;
&quot; according to In@@ dependence , the Council of the Council of Europe can invite any non @-@ member state to join the Convention . &quot;
the Secretary General of the Council notes the members of the Council and the contribut@@ ory states a ) the time of force of this Agreement and the names of the members who signed it without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval .
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this Agreement in compliance with a period of one year by ad to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
a reag@@ ent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olo@@ g to the anti@@ body or another on the label .
&quot; if a reag@@ ent is used by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the titanium is measured by always renewed di@@ lution of the Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es to the double in a suitable medium .
the titanium is the re@@ zi@@ pro@@ ke value of the number of strongest ser@@ um di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated only by the volume of blood bo@@ di@@ ly floo@@ ding in the total volume .
&quot; with anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents which are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time that is required for an ag@@ gl@@ ut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organisation has set standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B reag@@ ents as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for blood group determination , and for reag@@ ents of other species are elabor@@ ated at the time standards . &quot;
&quot; an international standard prepar@@ atory contains according to definition a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the Tit@@ ans that are observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The effectiveness of the reag@@ ents for blood group determination of most species is expressed as Ag@@ gl@@ ut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ters , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in a er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te floo@@ ding . &quot;
the titanium gives the di@@ lution of the reag@@ ent in the last mixture within a series where micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ically visible ag@@ gl@@ ut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
&quot; if you take them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B sc@@ iss@@ ors contain 256 international units per ml . &quot;
&quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot;
the following table shows an example of a comparative title of the International Standard Serbian Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A @-@ Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; PI@@ C FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
&quot; if a reag@@ ent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , the required properties should be maintained at least one year . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the decay date for dry re@@ reag@@ ents depends on the results of the shelf life attempts ; it is appro@@ achable by the state super@@ visory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ reag@@ ents are kept in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , and in the glass container where they have been dried and the so closed that no humidity can penet@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; a dry response may lose a maximum of 0.5 % of its weight , if there is no more than 0.0@@ 2 mm Hg in a pressure of no more than 0.0@@ 2 mm Hg within 24 hours . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the reag@@ ent ( or the solution delivered with the reag@@ ents delivered ) is an anti@@ se@@ p@@ tic and / or anti@@ biotic if the reag@@ ent continues to produce speci@@ fic@@ ity and efficacy . &quot;
&quot; sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2,5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml cur@@ ly or re@@ dissolved ser@@ um . &quot;
&quot; the reag@@ ents , as valid whether in flu@@ essi@@ er form or after the re@@ print , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor jel@@ ly or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the international exchange of certain reag@@ ents for blood group determination should not be dy@@ ed arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least until an international agreement has come into a uniform system . &quot;
&quot; reag@@ ents for blood group determination are in such a way and in such a way that it is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative contro@@ ll blood cells . &quot;
&quot; the amount must be so large in a tank , that the content may be used to perform the efficacy tests described in this protocol . &quot;
the manufacturer laboratory has over all production stages and controls of the reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group determination written records .
reasonable specim@@ ens of all given reag@@ ents are so long from the laboratory to keep up with some probability that the charge is no longer used .
&quot; the reag@@ ents used for blood @-@ group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the other are the necessary aids for strengthening the effectiveness and preservation of the stability of the reag@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective part . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin only contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal reag@@ ents can not contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; every single container is a black printed label in English and French language , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer &quot;
&quot; 4 . the amount or , in dried reag@@ ents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for the re@@ print of the liquid &quot;
&quot; in addition , this label or label on the box where the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers included in the following specifications : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 3 . the amount or , in dried reag@@ ents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for the re@@ print of the liquid &quot;
each shipment is a certificate according to Article 4 of the Convention according to the system to this protocol .

&quot; furthermore , it is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International Standard Prepar@@ ation of the Anti @-@ B blood @-@ group ser@@ um or a corresponding comparison par@@ at against a floo@@ ding of B @-@ blood cells . &quot;
the effectiveness of the ser@@ um may not be less than 64 international units per ml .
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood ser@@ um must also cause a slightly noticeable ag@@ gl@@ ut@@ ination of the blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
&quot; an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent floo@@ ds of A1 and A2 blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempts to re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International Standard Prepar@@ ation of the Anti @-@ A blood @-@ group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of the same activity . &quot;

&quot; an anti @-@ A + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um is mixed with the same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent floo@@ ding of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells , so the ag@@ gl@@ ut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 Â° C . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ R@@ h blood @-@ group sera each species can be one of two types , which can be distinguished by the conditions under which an ag@@ gl@@ ut@@ ination hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells can be achieved . &quot;
&quot; in other words , as &quot; in@@ complete , ag@@ gl@@ ut@@ ination can only be achieved in presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids like cattle alb@@ um@@ in or with other special methods . &quot;

the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ H group may change if International Standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) Blood @-@ group ser@@ um ( human )
anti @-@ D ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more people who are immune from the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ H system .
&quot; it respon@@ ds with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen . &quot;
complete &quot; Anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a titanium of at least 1 : 32 against C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cook@@ book solution .
