&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , psych@@ ic disorder , in which the patients of man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high @-@ mood ) have altern@@ ated with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat medium to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
&quot; for both diseases , the solution to insert or melt tablets in patients can be applied to the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take other medicines at the same time , the same as A@@ bili@@ fy should be adapted accordingly , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adapted . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ aired the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l probably works mainly as a partial ag@@ itation for the rec@@ ept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in less dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , to activate the rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing mental or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their recovery . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been investigated in three studies about up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that were compared to a plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ecting solution was in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased anxiety caused by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change of the symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution for embedding ( up ) .
&quot; in both studies with the inj@@ ecting solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than patients who received plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
abili@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was admini@@ stered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased anxiety and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for taking ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyram@@ idal disorders ( un@@ controlled swal@@ lowing ) , vom@@ it ( trem@@ ors ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , anxiety and exhaus@@ tion , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from mid @-@ heavy to heavy man@@ ic episodes with Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who were predominantly man@@ ic episodes and with those of the man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , were over@@ hau@@ led against the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee concluded that the benefits of inj@@ ecting solution in rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when oral therapy is not suitable to over@@ wei@@ gh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission shared Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for approval of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who were mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a conservation dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals .
&quot; an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is set out of combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases following the beginning or after change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , including treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ emia heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , one year or less , there were occasional reports on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; if patients with abili@@ fy treated signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be taken into consideration , reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a mut@@ ation , or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including abili@@ fy , must be set . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used in patients with cr@@ amp@@ ages in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states that are associated with cr@@ amp@@ hi@@ sts in connection with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an increased mort@@ ality risk compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ tin or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including abili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; there is no precise risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related adverse events in abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients , which allow direct compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ phen@@ ol and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing of glu@@ cose levels . &quot;
&quot; in general , a weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ tes , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as a side effect , and may lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is required if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 Ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , whereby this effect is not considered clin@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects , and therefore should have similar dose reductions . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with abili@@ fy , the potential benefits should wei@@ gh the potential risks for patients . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions . &quot;
&quot; after setting up the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage should be raised to the D@@ os@@ is@@ höhe before the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
abili@@ fy or esc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with abili@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l per day no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ an @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phic ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
&quot; due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of people and due to the concerns in reproduction studies during the animal , this medicine may not be used during pregnancy , unless the potential use justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics patients should be warned to operate dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :

a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and plac@@ ebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of routine controlled laboratory parameters did not have a medi@@ cally significant difference .
&quot; an increase in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and cra@@ amp@@ age cases , unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dose cases were observed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; however , there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in treating an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits is because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma yield . &quot;
it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder of the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tor .

in three plac@@ ebo controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; current readings are defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sions scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed significantly higher reduction in return rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l group and 57 % under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary purpose of weight gain was decreased by at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx . 6 kg ) . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dos@@ ages over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed plac@@ ebo @-@ superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms more than 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a superior effect compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l also showed a comparable share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of Man@@ ie on such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study conducted over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed to plac@@ ebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ie . &quot;

&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not have a hint of clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the ethnic affili@@ ation or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were similar to patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy subjects .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the im@@ pair@@ ment of the liver function on the Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metaboli@@ c capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mak@@ ologie , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ ogen@@ ous potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not be identified any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological significant effects were observed only when dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions observed , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , thus they have limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;

&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ ac disease was determined as a result of the avo@@ idance of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the G@@ alle of mon@@ keys according to repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3@@ times the average Ste@@ ady State Ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dosage of people based on mg / m2 . &quot;

abili@@ fy inj@@ ecting solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ecting solution should be termin@@ ated and started with oral use of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; to increase the absorption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deeply into the gl@@ ut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended for adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking account of the medicines used to maintain or ac@@ utely treatment ( see Section 4.5 ) .

a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and plac@@ ebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of routine controlled laboratory parameters did not have a medi@@ cally significant difference .
&quot; an increase in CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and cra@@ amp@@ age cases , unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as aden@@ inity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms with regard to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement from the initial value on the PAN@@ SS , Comp@@ onent Review at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe as@@ gi@@ tis , a similar efficacy in relation to the overall population was observed , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .

&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study conducted over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study expansion in man@@ ic patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed to plac@@ ebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ie . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular inj@@ tion 90 % greater the AU@@ C after receiving the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level at 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and mon@@ keys , resulting in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration of a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - or 5 times over the maximum human@@ ist exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; in studies on re@@ productive toxic@@ ity after intra@@ ven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns occurred after mat@@ ern@@ al exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human@@ ist exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety @-@ har@@ mak@@ ologie , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ ogen@@ ous potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not be identified any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological significant effects were observed only when dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions observed , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , thus they have limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of ad@@ ren@@ al car@@ cin@@ omas ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) , and an increase of ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c car@@ cin@@ omas ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ asis was determined as a result of the avo@@ idance of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the G@@ alle of mon@@ keys according to repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dosage of people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study , where 460 women participated with metast@@ atic breast cancer , of which about three quarters previously used a anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in the sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug contained in a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; only patients who were treated for the first time were treated for metast@@ atic breast cancer , with respect to efficacy indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metast@@ atic breast cancer , regarding these indicators , that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used for patients who are bre@@ ast@@ feeding , or before the start of treatment low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ eric numbers in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) confirmed that Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with which the first treatment is no longer used , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that it may not be given to other medicines with other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; January 2008 , the European Commission shared the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited permission for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metast@@ atic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metast@@ atic disease is missing and is not indicated for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine contained therapy is not indicated ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phi@@ l count &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neuro@@ pa@@ thy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in case of sensory neuro@@ pa@@ thy degree 3 , the treatment can be interrupted until an improvement in degrees 1 or 2 is achieved , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of di@@ os@@ is@@ ations in patients with slight to moderate im@@ pair@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been carried out with patients with imp@@ aired ren@@ al function and there is currently no sufficient data to evaluate D@@ os@@ is@@ Adjust@@ ments in patients with im@@ pair@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for the use of children under 18 years because of non @-@ sufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a Alb@@ um@@ in bound nan@@ op@@ ar@@ isation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient should not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no new abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ron number of the neut@@ ron number is up to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l , and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number is up to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorders ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; during a clearly defined car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity related to cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dence of cardi@@ ac inci@@ dence is not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of the patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ eme@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating methods . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not prac@@ tise pregnant women or pregnant women who do not prac@@ tise effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is ir@@ reversible . &quot;
women in addic@@ tive age should be used during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised , during and up to six months after treatment , no child can testi@@ fy . &quot;
male patients should be advised before treatment via a barrier @-@ con@@ serving procedure because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) , which can affect the transport and ability to serve machines . &quot;
the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects reported in 229 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study once all three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated .
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most notable hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ tically ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported to 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at any dose and indication in studies ( N = 78@@ 9 ) .
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasional ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;

pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active substance that promotes the con@@ formation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules out of the tu@@ bular fields and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their depression .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to an inhibit@@ ing of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital intervention phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
&quot; it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components in end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in vitro studies , the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in assi@@ sts the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ recep@@ tor is con@@ veys and due to the alb@@ um@@ binding protein SP@@ ARC ( pig@@ mented protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation can occur in the tumor area .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metast@@ atic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ part in@@ bound studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III study study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer .
&quot; this multi@@ focal study was performed in patients with metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma , either in form of solvent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ cation to the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medit@@ ation ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a imp@@ aired overall condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 The results for the general response rate and time until progression of disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who are &gt; first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree of patients who experienced peripheral neuro@@ pa@@ thy degree 3 during the treatment .
the natural course of peripheral neuro@@ pa@@ thy on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the agent exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml with a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intra@@ ven@@ ous therapy of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume amounted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the volume of distribution points to an extensive extra@@ v@@ ascular distribution and / or turn@@ around of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; the Clear@@ ance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ a was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
patients at the age of over 75 years have only been available since only 3 patients of these age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was measured at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and in front of light protected by 8 hours .

&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine , which has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active substance ( also called &quot; reference agents &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood circulation , in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications before the procedure is not possible , and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in treating patients with illnesses for which the medicine is shown .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to undergo a blood circulation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; the inj@@ ections can also be made by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate instructions . &quot;
patients with chronic kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency and patients who receive chemotherapy should always lie in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ ilit@@ er in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be controlled before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists and iron supplements should be admini@@ stered throughout the treatment .
&quot; in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency , or that the body does not speak adequ@@ ately to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also applied before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reducing the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell where a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a v@@ ene in a v@@ ene in a v@@ ene study with 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by ren@@ al problems .
&quot; at least eight weeks , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene before they were either switched to se@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; in addition , the company was investigating the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin had been tested with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ties of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were retained in the same degree as with those patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared with the patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ utter@@ ing mig@@ rat@@ ory head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ) or one of the other components .
se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions can be triggered .
&quot; the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union , the Medic@@ ines developed a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; August 2007 , the European Commission shared Medi@@ ce medicine P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG , an approval for the shipment of se@@ amed in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of the trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant ly@@ mph@@ omas or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma , who receive chemotherapy , and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( for example cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in case of planned larger operative procedures , which require a large blood volume set ( 4 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in adults without iron deficiency , where a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected . &quot;
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and a expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which cannot be used in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients with which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ular concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should lie .
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease . therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical trial and disease management is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ u@@ ties can be observed over or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ular target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ able vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be achieved . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ular value increased by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ular value 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) exceeds 25 % . &quot;
&quot; patients should be monitored closely to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is needed in the lowest approved dose , which is needed for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia symptoms . &quot;
the clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher yields than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher yields than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8@@ g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week by intra@@ ven@@ ous application if necessary with an increase of 25 I.@@ E. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease . therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical trial and disease management is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ able vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be achieved . &quot;
patients should be monitored closely to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose that is needed for control of an@@ es@@ thesia symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ular value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ coefficient , the dose of 150 I.@@ E. / kg can be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ u@@ bin@@ o rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ular value around ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ u@@ ti@@ um value around &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased by &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be broken off . &quot;
&quot; patients with slight an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposits of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ta@@ sia should be needed twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure . &quot;
&quot; the iron substitution should be as early as possible , for example , a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program started , so before the start of the se@@ ven@@ ous treatment large iron reserves are available . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg of 10 consecutive days before , on the day of the intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via the hose of a needle bar , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic cooking sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine in the circulation . &quot;
patients who suffer from treatment with some er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ cy@@ st at a er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ open@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia ( PR@@ CA ) should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed or another er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etic ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ open@@ ie ) .
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina p@@ ect@@ or@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ embo@@ li@@ sm ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients treated for a larger electro @-@ surgical procedure , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or under@@ taking disease : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial defects , v@@ ascular disease of the cardi@@ ac or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occ@@ ured heart attack or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ open@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti@@ qu@@ ated PR@@ CA after months after years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin .
&quot; patients with sudden loss of loss , defined as a reduction of hem@@ og@@ u@@ ties ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , should be examined and the usual causes for a non @-@ contact ( iron , fol@@ ate or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium , infections or inflammation , blood loss and h@@ amm@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes &quot; index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin anti@@ bodies should be determined and an examination of the bone @-@ marks for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of se@@ ven@@ ous in patients with a risk of anti@@ tumor @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .

&quot; controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that is attri@@ but@@ able to the supply of epo@@ xy , when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ation is increased to the concentration of the an@@ es@@ thesia symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ular rise should not exceed 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure .

&quot; if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ atic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ ies ) between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl . &quot;
the decision for the use of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in the participation of each patient who should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the start of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a larger electro @-@ surgical procedure should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ atic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially with an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it can not be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting dose of &gt; 13 g / dl can be increased risk of post @-@ rom@@ atic / v@@ ascular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ xy has not been proven that they can improve overall survival in tum@@ our patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tum@@ our . &quot;

&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to various common mal@@ ign@@ ome consistent , statisti@@ cally significant mort@@ ality than in the controls . &quot;
the overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the inci@@ dence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin treated patients and in insp@@ ections satis@@ factory .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ embo@@ lic events in tum@@ our patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival can not be excluded . &quot;

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used for treating the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones spr@@ inkl@@ ed ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a sli@@ mm@@ atic hip frac@@ ture as during the fall ; • Mor@@ bus pa@@ get of bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should be a major dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection in a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors that have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to review Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , almost 8,@@ 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of vert@@ eb@@ ral and hip frac@@ tures were examined over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures had been studied over a period of up to five years .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies at a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months long with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was whether the amount of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme , the bone substance ab@@ uses ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of sp@@ inal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced over a period of three years compared to the patients under plac@@ ebo by 70 % . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under plac@@ ebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta do occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated inj@@ ections .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) or other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta manufactures clearing material for physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients , in which the side effects of the drug should be explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission shared the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for authorization of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , acet@@ la@@ sta &apos;s in@@ fusion is recommended 2 or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors that have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium twice daily , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ ,000 I.@@ E. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
the inci@@ dence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by using acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney dys@@ function ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended because limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary , since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and teenagers Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for the use of children and adolescents under 18 years since data are missing for confidenti@@ ality and efficacy .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) as for these patient population only limited clinical experience .
&quot; prior to treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a pre @-@ existing hy@@ po@@ k@@ emia is treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid preparation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hy@@ po@@ k@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium twice daily , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; canc@@ ers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene should be performed before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental examination with appropriate preventive tooth treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental interventions , no data is available if the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the inci@@ dence of symptoms that occur within the first three days following the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be reduced shortly after applying acet@@ am@@ ol ( see section 4.2 ) .

kidney dys@@ function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ function which is considered to be a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the appearance of ren@@ al failure and restricted ren@@ al function were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the acet@@ one and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after receiving was 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta over 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values occurred below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the mor@@ bus pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical question@@ tures after a recently er@@ ated hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical trial , local reactions to the in@@ fusion centers , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen in the jaw area was adver@@ sely affected by cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the jaw area ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;

the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dosage Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value until 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value until 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
&quot; vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ ,000 I.@@ E. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
the effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment the BM@@ D at the overall appearance and shr@@ ink@@ age at all times .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % on the overall plac@@ ebo and 4.3 % on the enk@@ el@@ h@@ als .
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 508 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical question@@ tures was 7.5 % with Ac@@ la@@ sta treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % at plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a different study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , once a weekly administration of Al@@ end@@ ron in comparison to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ra @-@ BM@@ D could not be submitted for 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined for patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light to moderate @-@ heavy Mor@@ bus pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um mirror of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ D up to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper standard for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six months comparative studies .
&quot; the combined results were observed after 6 months , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain im@@ pair@@ ment compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients at the end of the six months main study were classified as a number of results ( on therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients , which were treated at the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach was obtained at 141 des with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared with 71 % of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , at a mean duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data shown as dos@@ is@@ independently . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma bars decreased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid biological dis@@ appearance from the big cycle with half @-@ value times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ in 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a leng@@ thy elimination phase with a termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation period t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above ½ -@@ values ) represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption into the bones and the elimination of kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the admini@@ stered dose in urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body clearing is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration at 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) . &quot;
a dimin@@ ished clear@@ ance by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ enzyme systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
&quot; special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dys@@ function to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require di@@ gestion of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
&quot; because for heavy kidney dys@@ function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , there are no statements available for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ active intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; for studies in dogs , single doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6 times of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , admini@@ stered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was obtained by rats in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dosage that corresponds to the 7@@ times of human @-@ therapeutic exposure based on the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C , equivalent ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application with cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , and the intra@@ ven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common infection in studies with repeated application was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aph@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ inflammatory effect of the substance . &quot;
&quot; in rats , a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ eity was observed in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , no ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects or embr@@ yo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ern@@ al toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to reduced ser@@ um calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and conditions before application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the approval application was carried out and works before and while the product is mark@@ eted . &quot;
&quot; Ris@@ ko @-@ Management @-@ Plan The holder of approval for the shipment under@@ takes the studies and additional activities for the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance , which in the pharmaceutical @-@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 004 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the approval application and all the following through the CH@@ MP approved versions of the R@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for the risk management systems for human medicine , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( PS@@ UR ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be filed • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements of safety , the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk of risk . • Within 60 days when an important milestone ( for the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) has been achieved . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a representative of a distance class that is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for treating oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus past@@ ure of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormon@@ es , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are made of and@@ ro@@ gens play a role in a rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone remo@@ ver takes place too quickly , and new bone material is re@@ constructed , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure once again norm@@ alizes a normal bone formation , thereby giving the bones again strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or have to undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you have other medicines or have recently been used / used , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines from which it is known that they damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drink , you worry that you take sufficient fluid in accordance with the instructions of your doctor sufficient liquid before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is admini@@ stered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; if you have broken down the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of acet@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is admini@@ stered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; as Ac@@ la@@ sta has a long time , you may need a further dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low after in@@ fusion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can act longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta has been missed , please contact your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta Falls you are considering the termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s date and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion may occur very often ( with more than 30 % of patients ) are less frequent after subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is un@@ clear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;

&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ gens ( such as sw@@ elling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the mentioned side effects will be dramatically imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this utility information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently inherited low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture is recommended to make the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic treatment . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid preparation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on the bone remo@@ ver , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia will develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure sufficient supply of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently inherited low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ ,000 I.@@ E. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; A@@ compli@@ a is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for treatment of adult patients , suffering from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above , and beyond one or more I &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies were conducted to over 7 000 patients in which AC@@ O@@ MP@@ LIA was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for setting up smoking . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the studies on the setting of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of AC@@ O@@ MP@@ LIA was difficult to estimate in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; which risk is associated with AC@@ O@@ MP@@ LIA ? it is the most common side effects of AC@@ O@@ MP@@ LIA , which were observed during the studies ( observed by more than 1 of 10 patients ) , were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract . ng The complete listing of the associated side effects reported in the context of AC@@ O@@ MP@@ LIA reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; it may also be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it can cause depres@@ sions , among other things , in a small minority of patients su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts . &quot;
&quot; caution is required for simultaneous use of AC@@ O@@ MP@@ LIA with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines against fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , Tel@@ i@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or Clari@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;

the percentage of patients receiving a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant Group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; the difference of the average weight change between the 20 mg and the plac@@ ebo group was 3,@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % by direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % due to the weight reduction explained .

&quot; in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of the conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be connected with process @-@ related stress as to dealing with the animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given a longer period before the pairing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no undes@@ irable effects on fertility or cycle disorders were observed . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated by rats in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .

Summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Company Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which the trials evaluated the trials carried out in order to obtain recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used for treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ sensitive diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) . • It can be used together with another diabetes medication ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
it can also be applied to Met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) which can not be satis@@ factory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fur resin or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fo@@ lic acid or insulin can be retained by the start of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced by the dose of sul@@ phi@@ lic acid or insulin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be used better and the blood sugar level decreases , whereby type 2 diabetes is better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was examined in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fur resin , additionally they received either acet@@ ate or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how good blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which can be concluded that the blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional donation of acet@@ ine to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fo@@ lic resin in a lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional donation of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of acet@@ ate and insulin in 289 patients was examined , the patients reported to insulin in addition to insulin , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with acet@@ ate were visual disturb@@ ances , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thesia ( decreased sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients who may be sensitive to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ tin ( high k@@ et@@ onic level - inf@@ ant - in blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ is is not shown .
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission shared Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for authorization of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , ar@@ ched and wear on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the in@@ scription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar with insulin is insufficient and un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are endanger@@ ed by the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or Ö@@ de@@ me , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and oil , when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is applied in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular trial with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced ma@@ kro@@ v@@ ascular disease was performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with elevated output liver values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard ) , or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T @-@ M@@ irr@@ ors are lifted up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzymes can be controlled as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient is developing symptoms that indicate hep@@ atic dys@@ function , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , super@@ building fever , ti@@ red@@ ness , loss of appetite and / or darker Har@@ n , are the liver cell values . &quot;
&quot; the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be continued , should be led by clinical evaluation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be stir@@ red by fatty deposits , and in some cases with a fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution under the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a minor reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ds ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; similar changes were observed in compar@@ atively controlled studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , in patients who receive Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ is@@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia is the risk of a dose dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ans , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , was reported on an occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a decrease in visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;

the calculated frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparative medi@@ ator .
&quot; in the PRO@@ AC@@ TI@@ VE study , a study of 3.5 years for examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medi@@ ator . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or this occurs ( see section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies on the interactions of the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ tas@@ m are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ ma@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around the 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s animal decreases , reducing the availability of metaboli@@ c sub@@ strates for the red@@ dish growth . &quot;
&quot; very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from present data not in@@ valuable ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary shift of the tur@@ g@@ or and the re@@ frac@@ tive index of the lens , as they are observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic substances . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T recei@@ pts were compared to plac@@ ebo , however less often than in comparative groups under met@@ form@@ a or sul@@ fur resin . &quot;
&quot; in an out@@ post study in patients with pre @-@ existing ma@@ kro@@ v@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or . &quot;
&quot; since the launch , it is rarely reported about heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more often when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of messages undes@@ ired events in random@@ ised controlled , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative medi@@ cation . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of current PRO@@ AC@@ TI@@ VE study , frac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medi@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported peak dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day over seven days did not occur . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to function on activation of specific core rec@@ ept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ator ) to function , which results in the animal model to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the peripheral glu@@ cos@@ ystem in the case of an insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until follow the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of optimi@@ zing phase with insulin , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued only insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosing in the group was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies about one year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was examined in a small and 18 weeks study of type 2 diabetes .
&quot; in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of the overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels and slight , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d , the total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study conducted over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was not only the in@@ famous tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial higher tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , as well as hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis as well as hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AC@@ TI@@ VE study , a cardiovascular trial study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced ma@@ kro@@ v@@ ascular disease in groups were random@@ ised , which received an additional period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing an@@ di@@ ab@@ etic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;

&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;

&quot; after oral use of radio@@ active mark@@ eted Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in humans , the marker was found mainly in f@@ ishes ( 55 % ) and at a lower level in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma elimination time of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral clearing of the mother &apos;s substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and mon@@ keys agree after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible excessive heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that in treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s animal decreases , reducing the availability of metaboli@@ c sub@@ strates for the red@@ dish growth . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased inci@@ dence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the bladder epi@@ th@@ eli@@ um were induced . &quot;
&quot; in an animal model of the family aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ans resulted in an increased frequency of colli@@ mat@@ ors . &quot;

&quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were investigated . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was not only the in@@ famous tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial higher tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study included the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal M@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ar@@ er Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and Rev@@ oc@@ ular@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that there is no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks associated with taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror that pointed out that blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may possibly react sensi@@ tively to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may have to be adapted when it is admini@@ stered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is the packing layer ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane over@@ wei@@ gh the risks of diabetes .
&quot; October 2002 , the European Commission shared the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , if a rapid initial effect can be desired together with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
the inj@@ ecting needle must be left at least 6 seconds under the skin to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar setting has improved considerably , for example through an intensive insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia symptoms can be changed and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phas@@ e- , long @-@ acting insulin , insulin @-@ analog@@ on ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin in animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage . &quot;
&quot; if changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient is required , this can be necessary in the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , taking over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such trips may cause insulin and meals to other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and ask his patients to ask for other medicines .

&quot; if the ur@@ inary in@@ suffici@@ ency after two to four weeks is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ ilit@@ er , the dose may be increased once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , it is recommended that patients may take at least during the first six months under treatment with A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic or other medicines for prevention of plaster . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study on which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( spot@@ ting medication ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( other medicines for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two dos@@ ages of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( once a day 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 m@@ g. a day . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ination was in the blood during the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients receiving A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of 80 mg daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients receiving 120 mg once daily , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and no one of 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , skin r@@ ash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart problems in history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood of ur@@ ic acid in the blood , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ emia in diseases that have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the history known or currently present ) and / or of arthritis .

&quot; for example , mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , lungs - Ny@@ han syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so widely increasing that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; liver diseases During the Phase 3 clinical trials of Phase 3 , slight symptoms of the liver function were observed with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at patients ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to perform a liver function prior to the beginning of Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ment and in the following course ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the process of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentration in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ function ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acids ≥ 10 mg / dl Et@@ wa 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT trial ) had a ser@@ um acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ lei@@ c rate was found at &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of the patients had no treatment against a plaster of plaster ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients had no treatment against a plaster ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the plaster size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the plaster @-@ notes until month 24 . &quot;

&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is observed an increase in the AU@@ C , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking single or multiple or@@ aler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for treating oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are bru@@ ised ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down after the first food intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; as al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate and vitamin D3 already are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company filed data that origin@@ ates from earlier studies and the published literature . &quot;
the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing the vitamin D mirror .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the share of patients with a low vitamin D mirror in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE were lower ( 11 % ) than those who took only Al@@ end@@ ron ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the company also laid the data that the al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dosage contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dosage that is needed for preventing bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the di@@ ges@@ tive apparatus such as abdominal pain , dys@@ function ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cer@@ a ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cer@@ a ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , sp@@ inal abdom@@ en , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , sp@@ inal abdom@@ en , and oxygen . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following indications are to be followed in order to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• The patient should not ch@@ ew the tablet or cr@@ um@@ ble the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not be taken before the first food intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; reactions such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ i@@ tis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ end@@ ron ( some were severe and required a hospital brief@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the doctor should be aware of all signs and symptoms that indicate possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to susp@@ end symptoms of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation such as dys@@ function , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ bul@@ ous pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing the medicines ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of severe mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients that use the medicine not properly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms associated with a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ end@@ ron no increased risk was found , rare ( after market launch ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reported ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;

&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the removal of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ atal therapy in patients who require a lower surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis of the jaw . &quot;
clinical assessment by the attending physician is crucial to the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be reli@@ eved that they should take the tablet in the next morning when taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE for taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking the intake of a tablet per week as originally planned on the designated day of the week . &quot;
other diseases that affect the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm ) should also be treated adequ@@ ately before the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate Food and Be@@ verages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients after taking Al@@ end@@ ron must wait at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the use of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither to apply for pregnant women during pregnancy .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at do not leave an indication of directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy that can detect embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post @-@ nat@@ al development .

&quot; the bio@@ availability increased to about 0,@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % , when al@@ end@@ ron has been taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast . &quot;
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ end@@ ron was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drinking of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) was no clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron ( increase in average in the range of 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies on rats have shown that al@@ end@@ ron is distributed in soft tissue after intra@@ ven@@ ous offering of 1 mg / kg , but then spread in the bones or dischar@@ ged with the urine . &quot;
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous offering of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active substances were found within 72 hours with urine and low or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ishes . &quot;
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous offering of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of Al@@ end@@ ron was 71 ml / min and the systemic clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is not ex@@ termin@@ ated over the acid or bas@@ al transport system of kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines is influenced by these transport systems . &quot;

the mean maximum concentration in ser@@ um ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and the media time until reaching the maximum ser@@ um concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
&quot; vitamin D3 can be hydro@@ xy@@ ated in the liver , and then in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ gen D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form , metaboli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; by using radio@@ active vitamin D3 , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity was 2.4 % in the urine after 48 hours 2.4 % , in the f@@ ences after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics of patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ g@@ ron@@ ate , which is not derived from the bone , is quickly ex@@ termin@@ ated quickly over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available about it , however , it is possible that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate as in the animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients with reduced kidney function can be expected to expect a somewhat elevated accumulation of al@@ end@@ ron in bone ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ agra@@ f is admini@@ stered to adult patients , a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent the transplan@@ t of the organ by the immune system . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ t was died after a treatment duration of one year ( by example , how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis ) was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further studies were conducted to 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examined how early in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot;

&quot; in patients with severe hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ lid antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and physicians must be c@@ auti@@ ous if others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time , as the precau@@ tionary dose or the dose of the medication may be adapted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange yellow capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule shell with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; ,@@ 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased inci@@ dence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immune suppression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of an experienced medical practition@@ er ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in consequence of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below )
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after change@@ over . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was the systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , with both form@@ ulations both at ni@@ er@@ eous and le@@ ber@@ ed patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearing , an adaptation of the Adv@@ agra@@ f D@@ os@@ is@@ lav@@ as can last several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient is not allowed in the first postoperative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment may be intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of approx . ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application For suppression of transplan@@ t rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy may not be indicated . &quot;
dosage recommendations - ren@@ al transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The or@@ ale Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments can be later needed because the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after transplan@@ tation .
recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The or@@ ale Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; D@@ os@@ is@@ recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f is a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules at once daily intake of precau@@ tion , so this conversion in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to take place on the whole daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day the treatment with the recommended or@@ al initi@@ als recommended in the ren@@ al and liver transplan@@ t is recommended for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transplan@@ t rejection .
&quot; heart transplan@@ t As an adult patient , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day can be taken every day once a day . &quot;
&quot; other gra@@ ft recipients Ob@@ probably there were no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pan@@ cre@@ atic and dar@@ m@@ transplan@@ ted patients , in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0,3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
D@@ os@@ is@@ Adjust@@ ment in special patient groups patients with limited liver function For maintaining blood tal@@ ons in the targeted area can be required for patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function as the kidney function has no influence on the Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um car@@ cin@@ oma level , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ ur@@ ance and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
&quot; switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is given caution ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
recommendations to the valley level in the whole blood The dose should be based on clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case under the help of thorou@@ gh@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odic insp@@ ections during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , D@@ os@@ is@@ Adjust@@ ment , Changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearing , adjustments may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the valley level is not exceeding 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice the valley level of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is usually in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in cases - and heart transplan@@ ted patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml .
&quot; during the following maintenance therapy of liver , ren@@ al and heart transplan@@ t , blood concentrations were usually used in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ t reactions or other side effects that can occur in a sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Sub@@ - or Over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; the formulation of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of an experienced medical practition@@ er ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 In the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be a therap@@ ist in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , there are no clinical data for re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recep@@ tor and transplan@@ t recep@@ tor in childhood , no clinical data for re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; because of possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us &apos;s blood and weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is contained , or other herbal remedi@@ es during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood level may be subject to considerable variations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under pro@@ gra@@ f , anter@@ ior chamber or sept@@ um hyper@@ tro@@ phy was observed under pro@@ gra@@ f , which therefore can also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothes or use of sun protection through a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us take symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and visual dys@@ function , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; in patients with rare her@@ edit@@ ary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption may be special caution . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedi@@ es that are known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , thereby increase or decrease the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - Blood Mir@@ ror in the same case of substances that can change the C@@ YP@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly pronounced interaction with anti@@ fung@@ ot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol , and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole , and the Macro@@ lid anti@@ biotic Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV @-@ prot@@ e@@ as@@ emia ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase in blood level is mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhi@@ bitions of g@@ astro@@ intestinal decay . &quot;
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used for acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be metaboli@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , affecting their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us desc@@ end the Clear@@ ance of Ster@@ oid contra@@ c@@ tiv@@ a , thereby increasing the hormon@@ al exposure , is especially careful to make decisions about recep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animal experiments showed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us could reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital and Phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ value .
&quot; the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not provide evidence that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and the outcome of pregnancy exists . &quot;
in u@@ ter@@ o Ex@@ position it is advis@@ able to monitor the new@@ bor@@ ns on any harmful effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on kid@@ neys ) .
&quot; there is the risk of early birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ emia of new@@ bor@@ ns ( inci@@ dence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , in patients suffering from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) is often increased . &quot;
cases of BK @-@ Virus associated N@@ eph@@ ro@@ pa@@ thy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal Leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours related to the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma @-@ map@@ rot@@ ein can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ s@@ able . &quot;
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ co@@ dynamic effects In molecular level the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ c protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell inn@@ s .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ c dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duction due to T cells and thus prevents transcription of a certain number of ly@@ mph@@ oma genes .

factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit@@ al value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ born faction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or one by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates after transplan@@ tation .

&quot; Adv@@ ate is used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a lack of VIII @-@ related , inn@@ ate bleeding disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application will then be applied to whether Adv@@ ate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or for prevention of bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor of VIII deficiency , causing bleeding problems such as blood cl@@ ots in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but after a method which is referred to as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
it is produced by a cell where a gene ( DNA ) has been brought into which it is capable of forming the human body factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ate is a medicine called rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate in the European Union , similar to that , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ata was awarded in 86 % of 510 new blood p@@ is@@ odes with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ant@@ ages may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to the human od@@ inn@@ ate factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; March 2004 , the European Commission invited Ba@@ x@@ ter AG to appro@@ ve the authorization of Adv@@ ances in the entire European Union . &quot;
dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of VIII @-@ deficiency after the location and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor of VIII activity should not be reduced under the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ U. / dl ) . &quot;
inj@@ ections every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute im@@ pair@@ ment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment process , the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections should be recommended to determine an appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plas@@ m@@ eric . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. from factor VIII per kg of body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor of VIII @-@ plasma activities cannot be achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor of VIII treatment is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be er@@ adi@@ cated . &quot;
&quot; depending on the condition of the patient , the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always quanti@@ fied against pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VIII , Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml , using modified Be@@ thes@@ da ass@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ory development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occurring of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of the h@@ amm@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation is no experience . &quot;
&quot; in the largest number of patients the AD@@ R@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , who showed a higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , rarely ( frequency based on the available data is not in@@ valuable ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirrors in plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post @-@ operative day .
clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE at 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 150 days ) only showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , in any of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of previously untreated patients of a current clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients with A@@ DV@@ ATE were treated against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of the patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by the study of anti@@ bodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persi@@ sting peak of anti @-@ CH@@ O cell @-@ protein , otherwise they did not occur any signs or symptoms that were referred to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were isolated about the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ tes in multiple repeated product compositions within the scope of the study . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the first approval , the CH@@ MP has remained positive as positive , but considered that the safety profile has to be monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s all 6 months , decided that the author@@ isation holder should apply for a further extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited distributed the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) that the company takes its application for approval for the transport of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , the chest , the brain , bones or the parts ( tissue that connects different structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; that has been modified so that there is no copies of itself and can cause no infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and thus allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defective genes in the human body , contributes to restor@@ ing damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA is not restored . &quot;
&quot; with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company filed data from a study with a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of sub@@ strate , in bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP insp@@ ected the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
based on the initial submitted documents the CH@@ MP on Day 120 created a list of questions sent to the company .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours benefits for patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee had further concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not been sufficiently proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; active substance release &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so merged so that one of the effective components immediately and the other is released slowly over several hours . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , caused by allergi@@ es against p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous sw@@ elling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and teenagers aged 12 , the recommended dose of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be added to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effect dimensions were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms that were reported from the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard sk@@ ala , how hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in view of all ha@@ y fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients who took aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , over a decrease of symptoms of 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients who took p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin . &quot;
&quot; if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients showed a relief of the symptoms of 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( cardi@@ ac ch@@ ase ) , oral dr@@ y@@ ness , sw@@ elling , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ tic@@ ular agents or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( other medicines for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze may also not be applied in patients who suffer from a con@@ vex glau@@ com@@ as ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac or v@@ ascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) , or already a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by brain bleeding ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission shared a permit for the transport of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , to swal@@ low it ( i.e. without breaking or ch@@ ew@@ ing ) . &quot;
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years due to the absence of data to in@@ concei@@ vable and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of use on 10 days , since long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in time . &quot;
&quot; after a decrease in the sw@@ elling of mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients suffering from mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin with other v@@ aso@@ con@@ stri@@ c acids such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , Er@@ got@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine , or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , the per@@ oral or nas@@ al as ab@@ ell@@ ular of Rhin@@ ology ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not checked and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce the dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dys@@ function and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce the dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients need to be informed about the treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ sis , or of palm @-@ pit@@ ches , cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ ache ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder and bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to conducting der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ amine can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce their scale . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in addition to er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alter@@ ations of the plasma concentrations were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences were detected between the patients and the plac@@ ebo treated patients , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme was not identified for metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , so that interactions with other medicines could not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 is not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ certain@@ ity of the application of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of pregnant women do not have an increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproduction studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and on the basis of the v@@ aso@@ con@@ stric@@ tor characteristics of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that it may result in very rare cases that may lead to an im@@ pair@@ ment of traffic , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ no@@ e , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , comp@@ a , cardiovascular collapse ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ rails . &quot;
&quot; head@@ aches , anxiety , terri@@ fying mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , ar@@ ous@@ al , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ts , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thir@@ st , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cip@@ ital pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ inn@@ itus , ap@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturb@@ ances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly likely for children , as well as A@@ tro@@ pin @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ illary pressure and dil@@ ation , skin irrit@@ ation , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the Ad@@ hes@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ecular P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ ine on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring parameters of the gli@@ des , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ uation , or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ tom@@ atic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ cin or manifestation of a Z@@ NS patho@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 248 patients participated in the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 414 patients received aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effect of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall results for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets in view of the sw@@ elling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes following the application in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ tory application of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin to day 10 was achieved . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ copic study , which was performed with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poor@@ ly contaminated . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin following the sole gift of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin bio@@ equivalent was to the expression of a Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mak@@ ologie , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , the pre @-@ clinical data can be detected with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no longer toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally linked to the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin . &quot;
&quot; in re@@ productive sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day . &quot;
&quot; March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the approval application , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ amine may contribute to alle@@ vi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets reduce symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever ) , such as Ni@@ esen , running or ju@@ icy nose , or ju@@ icy eyes , while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;

&quot; after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n it was very rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breath , whi@@ st@@ ling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and sw@@ elling ) or skin suggestions . &quot;

&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg / ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ sat for inhal@@ ing ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged up to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged 6 to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , and two studies of patients who had also had as@@ thma ) . &quot;
&quot; efficacy has been measured by determining the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ran@@ gle , im@@ pair@@ ment of sleep and performance at the day ) and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body evalu@@ ates the sy@@ rup , the solution to insert and melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children are harm@@ less . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , the results of all studies were taken , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the symptoms of symptoms after six weeks were treated with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components ) . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission shared a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( inci@@ dence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease process and can be re @-@ recorded after the ending of the symptoms .
the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( inci@@ dence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy periods .
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the scope of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were admini@@ stered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol did not increase the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that it may result in very rare cases that may lead to an im@@ pair@@ ment of traffic @-@ ti@@ ghtness or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients suffering from plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects that were reported more often than plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 juven@@ ile patients aged 12 to 17 years , the most common side effects were head@@ aches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and treated with 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the Ad@@ hes@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ecular P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ ine on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study with multiple sclerosis , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was admini@@ stered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed itself . &quot;
&quot; in an individual dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring parameters of the gli@@ des , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ uation , or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the relief of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the inci@@ dence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as illustrated by the overall results of the question@@ naire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ conj@@ unc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the eti@@ ology in different forms and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited quickly . &quot;
&quot; since the hist@@ am@@ infection is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement of symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo controlled studies about 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pron@@ ur@@ itus and setting of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients who were not re@@ acted to anti@@ hist@@ amine were excluded from the study . &quot;
improvement of the it@@ ching of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with the plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disturb@@ ance of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of the patients were reached a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant accumulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , this enzyme has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo , not C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose case study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not respond to the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mak@@ ologie , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , the pre @-@ clinical data can be detected with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that no data is available that support a treatment of inf@@ ec@@ tious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role . &quot;
&quot; about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years have metaboli@@ zed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , and find a higher pitch stress ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us si@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which metaboli@@ se is fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to the children who metaboli@@ se normally . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a su@@ cro@@ ase @-@ ion in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug should not be taken . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the scope of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were admini@@ stered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol is not reinforced ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall appearance of the side effects of children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us si@@ rup group .
&quot; clinical studies with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years aged for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily dosage intake of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children , the efficacy of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed itself . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents is no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets conducted tablets for adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect the psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , it was neither an increase in alcohol @-@ induced loss of alcohol , nor to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in relief of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo controlled studies about 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pron@@ ur@@ itus and setting of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metaboli@@ c phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ers ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with si@@ rup form@@ ulations in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are fully metaboli@@ zed . &quot;
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was approximately 6@@ times higher and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with a termin@@ ale half @-@ value of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days for adults and young people .
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C- and C@@ MA@@ x values were comparable to the recommended doses with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme &apos;s metabolism is not identified yet , so that interactions with other medicines can not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us si@@ rup is offered in type III @-@ bra@@ in@@ glass bottles with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate must be taken out without dam@@ aging them . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the scope of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets as in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ sat was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study with multiple sclerosis , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed itself . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gli@@ des , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ uation , or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;

&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting pot is removed without dam@@ aging them . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven until now .
the overall appearance of side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine si@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
&quot; in the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting pot proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ sat for the decreasing formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;

&quot; the spread of this badly metaboli@@ zed phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ sat , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , in conjunction with the dose @-@ fin@@ ish@@ ness studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets the use of the 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

the overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the melting tabl@@ ette revealed that this formulation represents an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical application .
&quot; the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , limited metaboli@@ c , is identical to the children who metaboli@@ se normally . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ ase @-@ I@@ som@@ ol@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug should not be taken . &quot;
the total frequency of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in small children between 6 and 23 months , the most frequently encountered side effects were reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , 2.5 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution were observed at a disposable dose of 2.5 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution to take side effects in patients between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
&quot; at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable to children and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents is no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may vary depending on the duration of the symptoms , alternatively in an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and &quot;
&quot; as illustrated by the overall results of the question@@ naire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ conj@@ unc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metaboli@@ c phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ers ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; as A@@ eri@@ us solution to initiate the same concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ equivalent study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
&quot; in various single dose studies , AU@@ C- and C@@ MA@@ x values were comparable to the recommended doses in pedi@@ atric patients with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. will officially announce that the company takes its application for the approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for prevention of avi@@ aries H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ Influ@@ enza in adults and older people . &quot;
&quot; in adults and older people , A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used for protection against flu that is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus . &quot;
this is a special type of vacc@@ ine that might cause an effect of the flu virus that might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ dem@@ ie breaks out when a new tribe of the flu virus appears , which can be easily spread out of human beings , because people do not have immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; according to the vacc@@ ine , the immune system recognizes the parts of the flu virus as &quot; &quot; physically &quot; &quot; and forms anti@@ bodies against it . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the immune system is able to form fast anti@@ bodies in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that det@@ ects the human body as a body @-@ alien ) , clean@@ sed and used as part of the vacc@@ ine . &quot;
a inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; in this way , the scope of the clinical data base was not sufficient for the evaluation of the safety of the vacc@@ ine to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ fabricated vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for adults and children over four years , which caused by the human immune weak@@ ening of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired immune disease syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to insert , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination is not investigated . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic drugs should only be prescribed if the doctor has tested the anti@@ viral drugs of the patient before , and the probability is that the virus will appeal to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which can be taken together with twice daily 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of aspir@@ in depends on body weight . &quot;
aspir@@ ation decreases in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; aids do not cure AIDS , however , the damage of the immune system and the development of AIDS related infections and diseases can be hes@@ it@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had not been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; with a low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who had previously taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ ym@@ ers earlier , compared to other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ e@@ as@@ sion@@ ate , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml as under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , aspir@@ ation also decreased the viral load , but of the children who had been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ ars , only very few to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ ars , the viral load treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ sts : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ sts , it came to a stronger tr@@ ash of viral load after four weeks than with the patients receiving their previous prot@@ e@@ as@@ m : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of as@@ gener@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , skin r@@ ash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ generic v@@ ase may not be applied to patients , which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to am@@ mon@@ oxide or one of the other components ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied for patients , the cur@@ rant ( a herbal supplement for treatment of depres@@ sions ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded as as@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in blood health . &quot;
&quot; like other medicines on HIV , patients who are taking aspir@@ in are taking the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( symptoms of infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years have been over@@ hau@@ led over four years .
&quot; in general , as@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee established that the benefit of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who did not have a prot@@ e@@ as@@ sion@@ ist did not have been proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information templates . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission shared the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to appro@@ ve the shipment of A@@ generic ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; aspir@@ in is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters can be admini@@ stered together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ assing avi@@ aries should take place under consideration of the individual viral resistance mu@@ sters and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than a capsule , therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable at a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 600 mg of am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ar twice a day together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of aspir@@ in ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg Am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dosage of 2400 mg Am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tics were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for the use of children under 4 years , due to the lack of data relating to safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver function disorders over 300 mg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; plant preparations , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ aries ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients should be pointed out that aspir@@ in or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy do not lead to a cure of HIV infection and continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with aspir@@ in does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually aspir@@ in capsules are commonly used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver damage with potentially fatal consequences .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic hep@@ atitis show increased inci@@ dence of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , which over@@ weigh@@ s over C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless it over@@ weigh@@ s the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the ad@@ ren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the inhibit@@ ing of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of A@@ generic ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including ra@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ ative R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ el@@ avi@@ aries ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metaboli@@ c interactions with am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ties , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ indications may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if there are even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl alcohol content , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patients . &quot;
aspir@@ in should be set to 5 if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ ticity , was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , or an ex@@ az@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other illnesses which were needed to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metaboli@@ c disorders . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ en patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ ars , reports about an increase of bleeding , including spontaneous uses of hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ at@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resistant opportun@@ istic infections that lead to serious clinical condition or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ tual eti@@ ology is assumed ( including the application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose have been reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic bread@@ th aspir@@ ation may not be given simultaneously with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ kon@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low Therapeu@@ tic Width A@@ generic ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with medicines , whose active substances are predominantly connected via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to compensate the lower plasma bar in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often unwanted effects were observed at the liver . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirrors of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with cur@@ rant ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient has already entered the St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pl@@ um mirrors and , if possible , to check the viral load and remove the cur@@ rant . &quot;
a dose adaptation for one of the medicines is not required if Nel@@ ly avi@@ r is admini@@ stered together with Am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; 508 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x , on the other hand , by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ar capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg Am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % lower when am@@ mon@@ oxide ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 m@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been reached twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 m@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ar ( 600 mg twice daily ) is admini@@ stered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be recommended because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was used in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ an component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the income of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and aspir@@ in are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , when using E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ el@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ sts would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ sic and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin may reduce the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if this medicine should be used at the same time , caution is necessary because dol@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ m@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if this medicine is used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ el@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous dispens@@ ation of am@@ eli@@ um and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase of side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin can be admini@@ stered together with aspir@@ in , it is recommended to reduce the dosage of sl@@ ot@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not carried out but the plasma bars of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
&quot; the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 m@@ g. of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 6 ) to the 2,@@ 69@@ times compared to the value , which was observed once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can , if they are used together with aspir@@ in , may lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with aspir@@ in .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ym@@ ers it is advis@@ able that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da can not be taken at the same time as aspir@@ in , as it can occur to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti @-@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va , known as an enzyme induc@@ tor ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of am@@ el@@ avi@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@
&quot; simultaneous taking with aspir@@ in can significantly increase the plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ function and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days on subjects , the fluor@@ inated cor@@ ti@@ sol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ constant interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous interpre@@ ter of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ co@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , unless the possible benefit of treatment is the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose fuel metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , significant increases in the plasma bar are expected to be expected at simultaneous administration of aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; because plasma levels of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to be more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations until stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased in the same time ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with oral @-@ recorded Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while using par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data to the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the size of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am for 3 to 4 fa@@ che .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on is admini@@ stered together with am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if there are even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the limited reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given , as am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ avi@@ r can be adjusted at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on at the same time . &quot;
an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality ratio ) is recommended for the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcing the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ atic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ indications is not predic@@ t@@ ably , therefore , alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the simultaneous treatment of aspir@@ in ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful consideration of the possible benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ tic rats , Am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of mal@@ ign@@ ant rats , which was admini@@ stered by the in@@ hibition in the u@@ ter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight during down@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the seed capital , including fertility and reproduction , has not been affected by the administration of am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ties to the mother animal . &quot;
in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the treatment were slightly up to moder@@ ately pronounced .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the intake of aspir@@ in or another at the same time for HIV treatment applied , or whether they are a result of the under@@ taking disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients were not treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ ars twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were judged by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medi@@ ator , were performed at more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fa@@ inter @-@ fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of bre@@ asts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ties in combination with lam@@ iv@@ udi@@ n / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ udi@@ n had been treated over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ es ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the study of PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , patients treated with am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ar 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin envel@@ opes were usually slightly up to moder@@ ately pronounced , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spont@@ ane@@ ously during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) reported . &quot;
&quot; in HIV infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resistant opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ generic ase twice daily together with low dose rates ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed in patients who received aspir@@ in together with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary supporting measures . &quot;

&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) was examined as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r is located in the area of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhibit@@ ing of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ra@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ Do@@ si@@ ties , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ born treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; in six@@ teen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients treated with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to 48 , with 14 isol@@ ate gen@@ otyp@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , with which a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ically failure occurred within the 59 , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / L , I@@ 47@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 47@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) , patients with vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ical failure occurred over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ m mut@@ ations : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analysis of gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be applied to estimate the activity of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ym@@ r resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / R , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / R , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased ph@@ ac@@ ic response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to alter@@ ations by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phenom@@ en@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ym@@ r resistant isol@@ ates . &quot;
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ically cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ders ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance testing .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ar associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally maintained . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between am@@ el@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ ars for all 4 F@@ ossi@@ p@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients ( one of them showed a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ar reserves its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ sts @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early break@@ age of a vers@@ al therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which can affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the efficacy of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard of care ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity towards as@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the Part Study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
primary analysis showed non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adj@@ us@@ ory average variable from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ slip threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
the efficacy of in@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous aspir@@ ation is based on two un@@ controlled studies with 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years old of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI .
&quot; in studies , aspir@@ in solution for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg two times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
&quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of patients included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 basic based on these data should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children of the benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the mean duration ( T@@ Max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast to 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is admini@@ stered together with am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ar ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ el@@ avi@@ aries 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady @-@ state ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approx . 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ar from the blood circulation into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; during the absolute concentration of un@@ brid@@ ged am@@ el@@ avi@@ r constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ate during the dosage interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore pharmaceuticals , which indu@@ ce C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , or inhi@@ bit or inhi@@ bit a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , be given careful when they are given at the same time with aspir@@ in ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ generic capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ bl@@ ur@@ ation exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bi@@ ob@@ tain@@ able than the capsules ; therefore A@@ generic solution and aspir@@ in capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
&quot; the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dys@@ function is likely to be low to the elimination of am@@ el@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ties similar to those that are achieved in healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ar twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , hep@@ ato@@ cellular A@@ den@@ om@@ es appeared in cases involving the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of the exposure to men , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ cellular A@@ den@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chro@@ mos@@ om@@ om@@ es test was not yet gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and detected in the clinical routine by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of aspir@@ in nor after the end of treatment . &quot;
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals that were treated at a age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality in the control as well .
&quot; in a systemic plasma @-@ exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under the therapeutic dosage of humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 When A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of aspir@@ in ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg Am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dosage of 2400 mg Am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ ative R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentration . &quot;
aspir@@ in should be set to 27 if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metaboli@@ c disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x , on the other hand , by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ar capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been reached twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 m@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ar ( 600 mg twice daily ) is admini@@ stered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be recommended because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ sts would be low .
&quot; if this medicine is used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ el@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin can be admini@@ stered together with aspir@@ in , it is recommended to reduce the dosage of sl@@ ot@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available . &quot;

an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality ratio ) is recommended for the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcing the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ atic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous intervention of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ ti@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min of am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ar by 22 % .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful consideration of the possible benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;

&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) was examined as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; the 50 % hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r is located in the area of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ar reserves its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ sts @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the children expected to consider the benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; aspir@@ in should be considered . &quot;
&quot; during the absolute concentration of un@@ brid@@ ged am@@ el@@ avi@@ r constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ate during the dosage interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore pharmaceuticals , which indu@@ ce C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , or inhi@@ bit or inhi@@ bit a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , be given careful when they are given at the same time with aspir@@ in ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a ren@@ al dys@@ function is likely to be low to the elimination of am@@ el@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , hep@@ ato@@ cellular A@@ den@@ om@@ es came with dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2,0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of the exposure to men after a daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r . &quot;

&quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; bund@@ oo@@ ster@@ med &quot; &quot; aspir@@ ation solution to intake was neither treated with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than a capsule , therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable at a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules , taking the solution to take the solution ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for aspir@@ in solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ mon@@ cavi@@ ar / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dosage of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there is no D@@ os@@ is@@ recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ generic solution for taking and low dos@@ ed rite cavi@@ ties to avoid this combination with these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adaptation for am@@ eli@@ um is not considered necessary for am@@ using , an application of A@@ generic solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ lo@@ co@@ content , a generic solution for inclusion in small children and children under 4 years , with pregnant women , in patients with limited liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;

&quot; the applic@@ ability and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated with al@@ dar@@ a . • For small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , the cream for six weeks is repeated three times a week . &quot;
&quot; the cream is in front of the sleeping area to the affected skin areas , so that they remain enough for a long time ( about eight hours ) on the skin before they are washed . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the agent ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with warts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo were performed either daily or fifteen times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with full treatment of tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 505 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phic ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions can limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before the bed and leave 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine is so long to continue until all visible inc@@ isions in the genital or peri@@ an@@ al@@ al area have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
&quot; an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should occur if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) , or when a infection is observed in the treatment section . &quot;
&quot; if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose has been left , the patient must apply the cream once he / she notes it and continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in a thin layer and in the puri@@ fied , with inc@@ lin@@ ts infected skin area until the cream is completely inserted . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be a sc@@ atter@@ ing between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible dis@@ advantage of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be a sc@@ atter@@ ing between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ discharge or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies where no daily pre@@ treatment was carried out , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and one case with one for circum@@ c@@ ision of leading stripes . &quot;
&quot; when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is a increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) in rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which caused a treatment and / or caused by a temporary physical im@@ pair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occur at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties with water causing disaster recovery and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine , immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous means for the treatment of external inc@@ isions in the genital and peri@@ an@@ al@@ al area , no clinical experiences have been found . &quot;
&quot; limited data indicate a higher rate of inc@@ lin@@ ations in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , lips , or the hair compound was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions take place in general during treatment or reactions after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the dis@@ comfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the treatment .
&quot; since there is no data available about long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be taken into consideration with super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s are no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of acute eyel@@ ids on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lips . &quot;
there are only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis of anatom@@ ical positions outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on low and hands support the efficacy in this purpose , therefore , such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normally occur in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause great dis@@ comfort , or very strong , the treatment can be subject to a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - les@@ ions showed a lower full healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune stimulation properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies don &apos;t go direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / red@@ dish development , the binding or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither one @-@ one nor after several @-@ time top@@ ical application of quanti@@ fied ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during bre@@ ast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most frequently associated and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with adverse events in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the location of the treatment of the inc@@ lin@@ ation ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
&quot; most commonly reported and probably or possibly using the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream application in connection with side effects , complaints at the application site are associated with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % . &quot;
the Phase III clinical study reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream were reported in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III .
&quot; the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with the side effects , in these studies , a reaction at the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine treated patients ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects produced by 252 in plac@@ ebo controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream were treated with acute ker@@ at@@ osis , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; according to the test plan , assessment of clinical signs show that in these plac@@ ebo controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream commonly found to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 23 % ) and oil ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the test plan , the assessment of the clinical signs show that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very frequently resulted in severe er@@ y@@ themes ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe vom@@ iting and cl@@ en@@ ching ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials to investigate the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment center or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the acci@@ dental treatment of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine increased systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines .

&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four weeks of treatment , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discre@@ te , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phic , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phic les@@ ions within a joint 25 c@@ m2 area or in the face . &quot;
the single @-@ year data of two combined observation studies show patients suffering from clin@@ ically degra@@ dation after one or two treatment periods a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the approved indications extra@@ ordin@@ arily inc@@ lin@@ ation , ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super @-@ visual bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients usually not on and were therefore not investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double blind plac@@ ebo controlled studies in children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ ag@@ i@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the doses ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % iri@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest pharmaceutical concentrations in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and wor@@ shipped 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bag ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated apparent half @-@ value was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ value after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of KG significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study for the painting application did not have similar effects on the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice showed no tum@@ ors on the application point in three days a week .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen is a risk for men due to systemic exposure as very low . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ours occurred in the group of mice treated with the effective cream @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and development of anti@@ bodies .
&quot; June 2003 , the European Commission shared Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to appro@@ ve alleg@@ ations of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union . &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using a re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ acid cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ stock of the Chinese H@@ AM@@ ST@@ ERS ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzymes in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) , in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary metaboli@@ c diseases .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this , all 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dosage scheme is recommended . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dosage scheme is recommended . &quot;
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any associated side effects , which occur during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment , in the re@@ charging facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients can form Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; because there is little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of a slight or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rates on half of the in@@ fusion rate , where the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to the decline , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen . &quot;
the in@@ fusion can be reduced to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the preliminary reaction occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ ca@@ ine because a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the intra@@ ocular pressure of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; because no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , is recommended , during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; the side effects in clinical studies were classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) . &quot;
adverse drug reactions associated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms that were observed during the Phase 3 Study and their extension with a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table according to the following frequency : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions were reported , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory condition and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ desired drug interactions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients in the age of 5 , reported mostly severe delay and treatment duration up to 12 months , reported , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ um version , whereby patients aged 5 and older were at the age of 5 years with a heavier inter@@ section ( average after 26 days at the age of 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase 3 study ( or until a premature termination out of the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not detected by radio immun@@ op@@ ti@@ cip@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) ass@@ ays ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say det@@ ectable anti@@ bodies , among them 3 patients , with whom it never came to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ om . &quot;
&quot; patients with lack of low anti@@ body levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG spi@@ ke in the har@@ n , while in patients with high anti@@ bodies a variable reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n was determined . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro that seemed not to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of anti@@ bodies did not seem to be associated with the inci@@ dence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ des with the formation of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats and the reduction of further accumulation of the enzyme activity .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ om@@ es , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ Phosph@@ ate rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study on 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of patients received the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of expected value , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received more than 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms treated with the plac@@ ebo group to improve lung function and conduc@@ tivity which is shown in the following table .
&quot; in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as seen from the following table . &quot;
the decrease of the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically non @-@ significant over this period clin@@ ically and the absolute lung volume increased further propor@@ tionally to the size of the children .
from the 26 patients with hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ ano before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study a normal liver size .
&quot; within the first four weeks , a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirror was determined in the har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes were summari@@ zed for five efficacy variable ( expected to be expected in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase II study was carried out , mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me at 20 patients , which were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the severe delay form and 4 with the mean inter@@ course form ) . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined after the Z @-@ Score for these age group The younger patients with the severe delay form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean inter@@ course form showed a normal mental development rate , whereas in the older patients with severe tre@@ ad form had limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ ological effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were performed at the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks may be an acceptable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged 5 and older was similar to the patients with older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mak@@ ologie , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift and reproduction sto@@ ic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data will not be able to detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;

&quot; this tab will have long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , as well as data on the natural pro@@ g@@ nosis of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase is split by certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amine @-@ ly@@ can@@ e ) , either in a small amount before or this enzyme is missing . &quot;
&quot; if you are allergic to one of the ingredients of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , or if you have any severe allergic reaction to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
an in@@ fusion reaction is any side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , inform your doctor if you take drugs that contain Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Pro@@ ca@@ in because a possible risk of reduced effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently been taken , including not prescription drugs . &quot;
for the handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intra@@ ven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors or medical staff ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient can gradually increase the maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - un@@ condition@@ ally involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory condition and face o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( a other medicine against cancer ) in patients who do not have chemotherapy ( medicines against cancer ) , or &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread out to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metast@@ atic &quot; non @-@ isolated &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the cell epi@@ thel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not yet been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have already received other chemotherapy as sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should receive cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin B@@ 12 ) and fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin B@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is admini@@ stered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in addition an &quot; Anti@@ eme@@ tics &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid deficiency ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects may occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , dropped or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of drug and a longer life in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ial i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously had no chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metast@@ atic disease that had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( other medicines against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin were treated over an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients with which the cancer did not attack the cell epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , during the fil@@ ing of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival than with the comparative medi@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission invited El@@ i Lil@@ ly N@@ eder@@ land B.@@ V. to appro@@ ve the authorization of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
every di@@ pping bottle has to be dissolved with 4.1 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the di@@ pping bottle and with a 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100@@ ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin on first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ cl@@ utter@@ ed bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - k@@ al advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ isolated bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( K@@ OF ) is admini@@ stered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² K@@ OF as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ isolated bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² K@@ OF is admini@@ stered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x therapy and the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid can be given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ k , at least 5 cans of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for further 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular inj@@ ector vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ gram ) in the week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ x dose as well as after each third stroke .
&quot; in patients who obtain P@@ emet@@ re@@ x , a complete blood @-@ image should be generated before each gift , including differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting . &quot;
&quot; the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ an@@ in @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should amount to 3 times of the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination has to take place under consideration of the n@@ adi@@ rs of the blood balance or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity of the predicted treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are applied for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; if patients should develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA has to be broken down , if patients after 2 doses of induc@@ t@@ ance or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 or so@@ - continue during the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials have no indication that in patients aged 65 , or above , compared to patients aged under 65 years , an increased secondary effect is compared to patients aged 65 . &quot;
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for the use of children under 18 years because of non @-@ sufficient data for safety and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials , in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , no di@@ os@@ is@@ ations required for all patients recommended dose adjustments . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing of under 45 ml / min was not adequate ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1,5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ am@@ inas@@ en@@ ae of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in cases of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be monitored with regard to the bone @-@ pointing analysis , and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x may not be admini@@ stered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ alisation number has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cycle rate has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neutral count , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as they were observed in previous cycles of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ologic and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ ic toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was considered - if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore all patients need to be treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce treatment condition ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ istic@@ a ( &gt; 1.3 g per day ) for at least 2 days before the therapy .
&quot; all patients , which are intended for therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long @-@ term value for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients who occurred these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the erg@@ ometers before the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x treatment will be er@@ adi@@ cated . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ ac inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x , when this drug is usually admini@@ stered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated liver compounds ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive capacity is made by P@@ emet@@ re@@ x , men should be advised to take advice on the sperm count . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ istic@@ a ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) can lead to a reduced P@@ emet@@ re@@ x separation with the result of a multip@@ lication of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is required if patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be applied high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high doses . &quot;
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and reduction of 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no data concerning the interaction potential associated with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long @-@ value times like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the od@@ ine status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring rate of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality ratio ) when the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x for pregnant women , but as with an@@ timet@@ re an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ x may not be applied during pregnancy , except if essential and after careful consideration of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive capacity is made by P@@ emet@@ re@@ x , men should be advised to take advice on the sperm count . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ re@@ x over@@ comes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the embroi@@ dered mam@@ mal can not be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of undes@@ ired effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with Mes@@ othel@@ i@@ om and the random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ers as well as 163 patients with Mes@@ othel@@ i@@ om who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was specified for the recording of all events , where the reporting physician maintained a connection with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x for possible . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity that were reported with &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients who received random@@ ised P@@ emet@@ re@@ x were comprised of su@@ pra@@ vent@@ ri@@ cular arr@@ hyth@@ mia .
&quot; the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to three different P@@ emet@@ re@@ x mon@@ other@@ api@@ ary studies ( n = 164 ) , except neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ an@@ int@@ ran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these sub @-@ variations are likely to lead to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal output values of the liver function tests .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of undes@@ ired effects that could be possible in connection with the study media ; they were reported with &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with N@@ SC@@ LC , which were random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ irs and 8@@ 30 patients with N@@ SC@@ LC , random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine . &quot;

&quot; clinical studies have reported cases of co@@ li@@ tis ( including intestinal and re@@ frac@@ tory bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal n@@ ect@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were reported in patients with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x treatment , sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tious pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure . &quot;
it was reported about cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ emet@@ re@@ x mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; there were cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis in patients reported before , during or after their P@@ emet@@ re@@ x therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ x ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting fol@@ lic@@ ally fol@@ lic@@ ally metaboli@@ c processes which are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
&quot; in vitro studies showed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ x acts as an anti@@ fol@@ at with several points of action by blocking the Thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ er@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ at@@ ogen@@ ous key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bios@@ yn@@ thesis of Thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ enes . &quot;

statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ial cell was shown in the scope of the L@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms led to an improvement of the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in the check@@ lar@@ m .
&quot; a multi@@ focal , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy , a medi@@ an survival time of 8,@@ 3 months with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; PSYNDEX is the most comprehensive abstract database ( not full @-@ text ) of psychological literature , audiovisual media , intervention programs , and tests from the German @-@ speaking countries . &quot;
&quot; limited data of a separately random@@ ised , controlled phase 3 study shows that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) are similar to patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination over the gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .

&quot; these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can &apos;t build some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats used to feed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients , the All@@ i 60 mg had recorded an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg while taking plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;

All@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there are not enough data for efficacy and safety .
&quot; however , as or@@ list@@ at is only minimal , in older patients with limited liver and / or kidney function , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary . &quot;
• Pre@@ mature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see section 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich individual diet or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with an improved metaboli@@ c control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes would be able to consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist because the dosage of anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics must be adapted . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this medicine has to be adapted .
&quot; it is recommended to take additional weak@@ ened prevention measures , to prevent the failure of the oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on interactions of medicines and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma bar .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Values ( international standard ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta car@@ ot@@ ene in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be recommended to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time , to ensure adequate vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; PSYNDEX is the most comprehensive abstract database ( not full @-@ text ) of psychological literature , audiovisual media , intervention programs , and tests from the German @-@ speaking countries . &quot;
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug because the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally slightly and temporary .
&quot; the frequency ranges are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data not in@@ valuable ) . &quot;
&quot; the inci@@ dence of known side effects reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were volun@@ tar@@ ily reported by a population of un@@ certain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to allergi@@ es with regard to possible and actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day over a period of 15 days were admini@@ stered to normal and over@@ weight subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; at the majority of the cases reported after the launch of reported cases of or@@ list@@ ine over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on human and animal studies , a rapid reg@@ ression of several systemic effects , which are attri@@ but@@ able to the essential properties of or@@ list@@ at , can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect is used in the lum@@ ens of stomach and upper small intest@@ ine due to kov@@ al@@ ent binding to the active ser@@ in rest of ga@@ str@@ ic and p@@ ank@@ atic li@@ pas@@ a .
clinical trials were derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at were taken three times a day that blocks the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
&quot; two double blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo controlled studies in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of the boundary ) was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) , and as a percentage of those students who have lost over 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies , weight loss was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the total cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; at the waist circum@@ ference , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the or@@ derly offering of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general the metaboli@@ c dosage was not only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of an accumulation .
&quot; in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients with minimal systemic res@@ or@@ b@@ ated dose , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites were identified , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ te Lac@@ ton@@ hole ) and M3 ( M1 after split the N @-@ form@@ yl @-@ Leu@@ cin group ) , which estimated approximately 42 % of the overall plastic concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mak@@ ologie , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , can@@ ogen@@ ic potential and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified any particular danger to humans . &quot;

All@@ i is used for weight reduction and is used for over@@ weight adults over 18 years with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or above . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a fat and cal@@ orie diet .
BM@@ I helps you determine whether you have a normal weight in relation to your height .
&quot; even if these diseases do not cause you to feel un@@ comfortable , you should still ask your doctor to check for a check examination . &quot;
&quot; for each 2 kg body weight you can lose within a diet , you can lose an additional kil@@ ogram using all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in is used for organ transplan@@ ts , in severe rheum@@ ato@@ id arthritis and certain severe skin diseases . • war@@ far@@ in or other medicines that have a blood di@@ lution effect . &quot;
oral contrac@@ eption prevention and all@@ i • The effect of oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive means for pregnancy prevention ( p@@ ill ) is weak@@ ened or lifted up when you have strong di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) .
please use all@@ i to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use : • Apply A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on to treat cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as . • Apply Ac@@ arb@@ osis to treat diabetes .
&quot; ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take any medicine against high blood pressure , as possibly the dosage must be adjusted . • If you take drugs against high cholesterol , you may need to adjust the dosage . &quot;
&quot; as you can set your cal@@ orie levels and fats , you can find out more useful information on the blue pages in section 6 . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a meal or contain a meal , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional considerations ( see Section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to your body to the new eating habits , start before the first capsule intake with a cal@@ orie and low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; diet menus are effective , as you can easily understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your dietary habits . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for calories and one for fat . &quot;
&quot; • Learn to reduce the probability of diet @-@ related symptoms ( see Section 4 ) . • Use to move more , before you start taking the capsules . &quot;
do not forget to ask your doctor if you are not acc@@ ustom@@ ed to physical activity .
&quot; • If you can &apos;t find any reduction in your weight after 12 weeks of application of all@@ i , please ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot;
&quot; • In case of a successful weight loss , it is not about to re@@ plen@@ ish the diet and return to the old habits again . &quot;
&quot; • If more than an hour passed since the last meal , take the intake of the capsule . • If more than an hour passed since the last meal , take no capsule . &quot;
&quot; ( see section 1 ) , ( see section 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; severe allergic reactions • Heavy @-@ allergic reactions can be detected in the following changes : severe breathing , sweat breaks , skin r@@ ashes , it@@ ching , sw@@ elling in the face , heart ras@@ ps , circul@@ atory collapse . &quot;

&quot; effects on blood tests It is not known how often these effects occur . • Increase in certain liver enz@@ ym@@ atic effects , effects on blood cl@@ ot@@ ting in patients , war@@ far@@ in or other blood di@@ lution ( an@@ tic@@ ulated ) medicines . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the mentioned side effects may be considerably affected or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this service information .
the most common side effects depend on the effect of the capsules together and thus arise that increases fat from the body .
&quot; these side effects occur usually within the first weeks after treatment starts , since you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in diet . &quot;
• Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take .
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you will exceed your fat limit . &quot;
&quot; you can save the amount of calories and fat that you may take a meal per meal , not to take them in form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a held ch@@ ap , as you might have done with other programs for weight reduction . &quot;
&quot; • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with Si@@ lic@@ hail , which serve to keep the capsules dry . &quot;

over@@ weight has influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • diabetes • Heart diseases • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis care with your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
&quot; a permanent weight loss , for example by improving the diet and more movement , can prevent severe diseases and has positive influence on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn to feed permanently healthy . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ jou@@ le , which you can also find as indication on the packaging of food@@ stu@@ ffs . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take a maximum per day . &quot;
• The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with every meal .
&quot; what amount is appropriate for you , see the information below that indicates the number of calories that are suitable for you . • Due to the effectiveness of the capsule is essential to comply with the recommended fat intake . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body can &apos;t process these amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; due to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss and reduce the probability of diet @-@ related symptoms . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight continuously and continuously about 0.5 kg per week , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you can burn only little or not , stairs , work in the garden or other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal daily , e.g. by 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 minutes of garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For a lasting weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and to keep it . • Sinn@@ voll is a nutritional diet with information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . &quot;
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combined the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of further information material that can help you to feed cal@@ orie and fatty acids and give guidelines to be physically active .
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type , you can help you develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is applied to chemotherapy , the strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the excessive trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as anti@@ eme@@ tics ) .
the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended because there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient is the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) to the rec@@ ept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; alo@@ ft has been examined in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or excessive sol@@ vers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting were 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ ha , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the excessive trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ ha had no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission approved the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the transports of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; alo@@ ft is indicated : prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer , and to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting caused by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid to chemotherapy .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the thickness of the colon , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agoni@@ sts , however , be careful with the con@@ current offering of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is prolonged or that tends to be an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to other chemotherapy treatment , Alo@@ xi should neither be used for prevention nor to treat nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tum@@ ours directed against tum@@ ours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction was found between a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ Stat@@ e- Con@@ centr@@ alised Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pri@@ am@@ ids , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; using Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron &apos;s application in human pregn@@ ancies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observed side effects ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least likely associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the location ( burning , curing , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were indicated in post @-@ marketing experience . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequency of adverse events like in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships . &quot;
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out , due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective in an alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosing . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value @-@ time 3 hours ) , which was given intra@@ ven@@ ously at day 1 . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ arb@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to the 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given to day 1 intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
results of the study with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
&quot; clinical trials of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were comparable to the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron to blood pressure , heart rate , and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the I@@ onic channels involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular and rep@@ ol@@ arization , and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study was to assess the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. admini@@ stered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous donation follows an initial acceptance of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ value of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the whole range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous offering of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average mean ( ± SD ) was measured between day 1 and day 5 measured mean ( ± SD ) increase in the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to three consecutive days at 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached the value of 0.@@ 75 mg according to one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; approximately 40 % are eliminated over the kid@@ neys and some 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in less dimensions , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ modified agent made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt connection with healthy dogs , the total body temperature 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver function , the termin@@ ale elimination time and the average systemic exposure is increased with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after exposure to the maximum human@@ ist exposure , which suggests a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggest@@ ing that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels , which are involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ arization , and can pro@@ long the action of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was equivalent to approximately the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which resulted in a multip@@ licity of liver tum@@ ors , end@@ oc@@ rine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid g@@ land , hyp@@ ophy@@ sis , pan@@ cre@@ as , secondary ni@@ er@@ en@@ um ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and da Alo@@ xi used for a unique application , the relevance of these results is low as for humans . &quot;
the holder of this author@@ isation for the shipment must inform the European Commission on the plans for transport within the framework of this decision approved drug .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative opinion in which the approval of the approval of hep@@ atitis C intended for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C was recommended for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal product , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference agents &quot; ) . &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hep@@ atitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue damage the liver tissue damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) is increased in the blood . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of the active substance .
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon reported data that prove the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and efficacy of hep@@ atitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hep@@ atitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; the study was measured , as many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the medication ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non commercial
&quot; furthermore , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug is not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C , which spoke to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after adjusting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was once again ret@@ ard@@ ant in more patients than in the reference of the reference specialist ; furthermore , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test for examination of the question was to what extent the drug is immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied to the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( crack or chi@@ ves ) , cho@@ ke cub@@ es and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for treating infections that were proven or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ her@@ te Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go may not work against this type of infections .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go may be applied for patients at the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years , the skin area may not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient is not talking after two or three days , the physician should examine the patient and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the share of patients whose infection was dis@@ kl@@ ed after the end of the treatment .
&quot; PSYNDEX is the most comprehensive abstract database ( not full @-@ text ) of psychological literature , audiovisual media , intervention programs , and tests from the German @-@ speaking countries . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken into skin , about 90 % of the patients of both groups were treated to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies however , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( iron @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections , which were proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the job .
&quot; the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go may over@@ wei@@ gh the risks of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • Quick small Laz@@ er@@ ations , Scra@@ ped@@ es or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; may 2007 , the European Commission shared the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; patients , who have no improvement within two to three days , should be examined once again and be considered as an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be , the treatment should be canc@@ eled , the sal@@ be carefully cut off and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection can be started . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for treating infections where MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place occurs .
the effect of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after top@@ ical application on isolated skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ ing in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After con@@ current oral dosage of 2 times daily 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on the dic@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure after top@@ ical application in patients , dose adjustments are not required for top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin during a systemic treatment with C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and red@@ dish / post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should be applied during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in the administration of a systemic anti@@ biotic .
&quot; in the decision whether the bre@@ ast@@ feeding continued / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued , between the benefits of bre@@ ast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies at 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most frequently reported side effect ir@@ rit@@ ation at the location , which was approximately 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance produced by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us ( P@@ leu@@ ur@@ us pass@@ ap@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the action mechanism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding point of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms which differs from the binding sites of other rib@@ os@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the rib@@ os@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the rib@@ os@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ ding Centre and the Pep@@ ti@@ dyl@@ lion Centre .

&quot; on the basis of the local pre@@ valence of resistance to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some infection forms , a consultation can be targeted by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , ir@@ respective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be was applied daily under occ@@ lusion and applied for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be was obtained twice a day for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected traum@@ atic wounds twice a day for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected traum@@ atic wounds . &quot;
the sampling was performed on 3 or 4 during the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic absorption of people after top@@ ical application of 1 % s@@ alo@@ on on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 mal lower than the retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP escap@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in vitro oxid@@ ative met@@ aboli@@ sm in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on the oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) that were performed over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;

&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune against these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix is applied as part of a vacc@@ ination plan in the course of one of two doses , whereby a protection against hep@@ atitis B may be achieved only after the second dose is reached . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix must only be used when immun@@ isation consists of a low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and ensures that the vacc@@ ination can be carried out from two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refre@@ sher dose is desired against hep@@ atitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hep@@ atitis A or B vacc@@ ine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by bringing the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) , &quot; how it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces anti@@ bodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ ine of Twin@@ rix adults and since 1997 certified vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used for protection against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are admini@@ stered in one of three doses of existing vacc@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults are also used as a cover for the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the share of the vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective anti@@ body concentration for one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of vacc@@ ine was compared with a six @-@ month period and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix conducted a month after the last injection for the development of protective anti@@ bodies against hep@@ atitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree was similar in a six @-@ month period and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ ache , appetite deficiency , pain in the inj@@ ector , red@@ ness , mat@@ ernity ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to the active substances , one of the other constitu@@ ents or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an anti@@ biotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission shared G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permission for the establishment of Ambi@@ rix in the entire region
&quot; the standardis@@ ed plan for pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is admini@@ stered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refre@@ sher vacc@@ ine is required for hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination sim@@ mer . &quot;
the anti @-@ hep@@ atitis B anti @-@ hep@@ atitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti@@ bodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not fully assured whether immun@@ ity people who have addressed to a hep@@ atitis A- vacc@@ ination , as they may also require a refre@@ sher vacc@@ ination as protection as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of vacc@@ ine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring are always available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the standardis@@ ed sn@@ ema is recommended with the combination sim@@ mer , which contains 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ body , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ inations may be required . &quot;
&quot; as an intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the gl@@ ut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ aired success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected by sub@@ cut@@ aneous sub@@ cut@@ aneous recep@@ tor , since it can occur in these cases according to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was admini@@ stered in the second year in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ ti@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us @-@ vacc@@ ine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that possibly insufficient immune response is achieved . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ ur@@ ality , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever compar@@ es with the frequency associated with previous Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vacc@@ ine form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were admini@@ stered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines in the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans compound . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ern@@ al on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared with 39.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the preparation of a dose of 3 doses . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ine cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects had been given , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination sim@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the inci@@ dence of severe pain and mat@@ ern@@ al was low and comparable to the preparation of the combination sim@@ mer with the 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ine .
&quot; in a comparative study with 1 to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ te Group was comparable to that , with 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( on the inj@@ ector ) per dose , not per pro@@ p , is reported . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of vacc@@ ines , which reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 cans of re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally not different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials that were conducted in vacc@@ ines in the age of 1 to 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.1 % was one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , a month 6 admini@@ stered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ o@@ at rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , a month 6 admini@@ stered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparable study , which was carried out at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combin@@ ant compound with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ eity was evaluated , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix in the month 2 and 6 . &quot;
&quot; the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical trial case with 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , a month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ine with a combination of 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; for persons who were at the time of pri@@ ming between 12 and 15 years old , the persi@@ stence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ine . &quot;
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that which after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination compound consisting of 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ ati@@ ti@@ s- A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
&quot; in a clinical trial with 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persi@@ stence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ine is comparable to the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ine scheme . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life is at the same time with the finding of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ ti@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for earlier formulation .

&quot; the hep@@ atitis A virus is usually transmitted by viruses containing food and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in water contaminated by wast@@ ewater . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( gel@@ atin ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not protect fully from an infection with hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
&quot; if you / your child may already be infected with hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B virus ( although you / your child feels un@@ comfortable or ill ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent illness . &quot;
protection against other infections affecting the liver or cause symptoms that are similar to those after a hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B infection may not be medi@@ ated .
&quot; • If your child is already an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vacc@@ ine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an anti@@ biotic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can express itself by ju@@ icy skin r@@ ashes , breathing difficulties or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . • If you / your child has suffered a severe infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months , before the use of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) . &quot;
&quot; with a possible risk of an infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from an vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he will advise you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced content of effective components per vacc@@ ination ( 360 EL@@ ISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis C virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vacc@@ ine with reduced content of effective components is usually admini@@ stered a month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination against the vacc@@ ination of your child .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected in people suffering from severe bleeding disorders under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you are weak@@ ened / your child due to illness or treatment in your / his body &apos;s own defense / or if you / your child will undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction is to vacc@@ ine . &quot;
21 Sa@@ ying your doctor if you are taking other medicines ( including those you have received without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or have received immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( anti@@ bodies ) or have been planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for vacc@@ ine and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B virus . &quot;
&quot; if another vacc@@ ine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible different limb@@ s . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix should be admini@@ stered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to vacc@@ ine is still sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or nursing women is not admini@@ stered except it is urg@@ ently needed that they can be vacc@@ inated against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( anti@@ biotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs up to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data that has been known for the first approval for the shipment , the CH@@ MP passed the view that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , Ambi@@ rix has only been brought into transport only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ ies can also be used for patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high am@@ mon@@ ial concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ y is divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed under the food or via a gas stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the stomach &apos;s stomach &apos;s stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
&quot; it was not a comparable study , since am@@ mon@@ ies were not compared to any other treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a medi@@ an medication , i.e. without active substance ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ ies can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant od@@ our or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ ies were effectively prevented in patients with disturb@@ ances of the ure@@ a cycle to high am@@ mon@@ ia values .
&quot; am@@ mon@@ ies was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because due to the condition of the illness at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine page . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , where a complete enzyme shortage has already been manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect , which is manifest@@ ed after the first month of life ) there is an indication for the use if in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis there is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disturb@@ ances , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ules . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually by taking into account the protein tolerance and the development needed for the growth and development of the daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; after the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults . &quot;
the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ ine deficiency have to be ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not be admini@@ stered patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not get immediately into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should therefore be used for patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and can only be used with caution .
&quot; since metaboli@@ c and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate over the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should only be used with utmost caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these findings regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous therapy of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed irrit@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
&quot; it could not be noticed if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during bre@@ ast@@ feeding times ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS at 56 % of the patients at least an undes@@ ired event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ect@@ omy patient , which developed a metaboli@@ c end@@ c@@ eption in conjunction with lac@@ tat@@ azi@@ dosis , heavy hy@@ po@@ k@@ emia , peripheral neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms proceed with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metaboli@@ c active compound , con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for elimination of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle may be assumed to be produced for each gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance that diagnosis is made early and treatment immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the inci@@ dence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ anti@@ le , and the disease led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues within the first year of the year . &quot;
&quot; due to hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ) , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first month of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ defect form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ical form of or@@ ni@@ th@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated with a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy , and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is ox@@ idi@@ zed into phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atically with gl@@ ut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is formed . &quot;
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat with so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the ur@@ inary tract and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous offering of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ cl@@ usal disorders or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 m@@ g. / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma bar were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
the medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine on kid@@ neys .
&quot; after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no compla@@ ined effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is taken either oral ( inf@@ ants and children who cannot swal@@ low tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disturb@@ ances ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; after the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of am@@ mon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins should be kept within the normal area . &quot;
the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when R@@ atten@@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth Phen@@ yl@@ phen@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the brain . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ect@@ omy patient , which developed a metaboli@@ c end@@ c@@ eption in conjunction with lac@@ tat@@ azi@@ dosis , heavy hy@@ po@@ k@@ emia , peripheral neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for elimination of excess excess . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of examinations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine in patients with disturb@@ ances of the ure@@ a cycle , the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state may occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ul@@ ate form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the mean measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large knife . 8,@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS may be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are lacking , so that they can accum@@ ulate the sti@@ ck@@ able waste products that accum@@ ulate after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you may take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , as So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines , inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently been taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during bre@@ ast@@ feeding you may not take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , as the medicine may over@@ take into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , taste disorders , post@@ ure of the ear , dis@@ ori@@ enting , memory disorders and deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical states have been observed . &quot;
&quot; if you find one of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency recovery of your hospital for initi@@ ating a corresponding treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forget the intake of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

&quot; when taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines , inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently been taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS on equal single doses or carry over a stomach fi@@ stel ( hose that runs through the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose that is guided through the nose in the stomach ) .
&quot; • Do not take a raz@@ or of gran@@ ulate in the container , e.g. a knife through the edge of the knife to remove excess gran@@ ules . • Dis@@ charge the recommended number of spo@@ ons of gran@@ ulate from the container . • Dis@@ charge the recommended number of knives of gran@@ ulate from the container . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used for treatment adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ abil@@ er ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ arkt ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; ST@@ - Lift &quot; &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measured value at electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is applied to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients using a PCI , a higher dose is admini@@ stered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the major study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a Gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , the patient is frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube which remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a closure ) and they received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ x@@ ima@@ b and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who under@@ went a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other components ) . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be applied for patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack . &quot;
the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in in the treatment of ACS and a PCI .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission shared the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd , a permission for the transports of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non @-@ ST @-@ mid@@ ation inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency intervention or when an early intervention is fores@@ een .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is carried out in another episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bolt may be admini@@ stered by 0.5 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us @-@ offering of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been investigated , and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned . &quot;
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened to under 225 seconds , should be a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the inci@@ dence of lower ACT values , the re@@ plen@@ ished and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ dose should be admini@@ stered intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dosage is properly admini@@ stered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( ob with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second bolt may be admini@@ stered by 0.3 mg / kg and re @-@ check the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after receiving the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n @-@ Bol@@ us without D@@ os@@ is@@ cation at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of in@@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of lower molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• heavy un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and / or mis@@ versi@@ tile dys@@ function . • heavy un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and / or mis@@ versi@@ tile dys@@ function . • heavy un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and / or mis@@ versi@@ tile dys@@ function . • heavy un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n is admini@@ stered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if in case of PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n the majority of arter@@ ial points may occur , patients who undergo a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during the treatment in principle everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are under war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ ative R@@ atio ) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n is again achieved before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge about the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these substances may increase the risk of blood . &quot;
the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation and anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are regularly monitored regularly .
&quot; the animal experiments are related to the effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the binding or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either in@@ frac@@ tional ha@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n group as well as in the group of he@@ par@@ in treated comparative groups , women and patients had more than 65 years of adverse events than with male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding were defined according to Ac@@ u@@ ity and Tim@@ i measures for severe bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding were significantly lower than in the group with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
&quot; Ac@@ u@@ ity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : contrac@@ eption , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular blood pressure or bleeding in the point of the point , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding centre , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ aliz@@ ations that occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot;
the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n at 6000 patients who under@@ went a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n group as well as in the group of he@@ par@@ in treated comparative groups , women and patients had more than 65 years of adverse events than with male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding were significantly lower than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects that are not listed above are summari@@ zed after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes in Table 6 .
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n is to be removed immediately and the patient can monitor the patient with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox includes Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ ic inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the ani@@ ons bin@@ dings region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or on the t@@ inn@@ itus . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and there@@ with its effect is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in itself spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , so that the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n was involved in ser@@ um of patients with ser@@ um in the past to he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ hibited th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ str@@ ated th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n shows a dose @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ al@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect that is occupied by the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; in case of the patient below a PCI was performed , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5mg / kg of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n was given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h should be increased . &quot;
in the arm A the Ac@@ u@@ ity study was admini@@ stered in@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin in accordance with the relevant guidelines for treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ mid@@ ation inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before angi@@ ography ( at the time of the boundary ) or at the PCI .
&quot; in the Ac@@ u@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk lenses were distributed ev@@ enly across the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; about 77 % of patients had a recur@@ ring sc@@ a@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardi@@ ac biom@@ ark@@ er , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients under@@ gone within 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; primary analysis and results from the Ac@@ u@@ ity study for the 30 @-@ day and the 1- End point for the overall population ( IT@@ T ) and for patients , aspir@@ in and Clo@@ pi@@ dog@@ rel , are presented in tables 7 and 8 . &quot;

clinical trials with a small number of patients delivered limited information about the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n were evaluated in patients who under@@ went a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n as Pep@@ ti@@ d is going to undergo a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid components with subsequent re@@ valuation of amino acids in the body pool .
&quot; the primary metabolism , resulting from the split of the AR@@ G3 Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence by Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , is not effective because of the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;

diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce sufficient insulin to control the glu@@ cose levels ( sugar@@ s ) in the blood or the insulin can not be processed effectively .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it acts faster and faster active life than a short @-@ effective human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body can not produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; in case of type 2 diabetes , in which the body can not be processed effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how good blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes , after six months , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % at insulin @-@ spr@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % at human normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine or one of the other components , or for patients who are already suffering from a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may have to be adapted when it is admini@@ stered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glu@@ cose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission shared San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal ceiling , th@@ ig@@ h or del@@ ta , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abs . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ cose capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the effect , the brand ( Her@@ - manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delay , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in insulin needs . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage or break of treatment , in particular in patients with an ins@@ ular diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage .
the time of occurrence of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
&quot; the substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the inc@@ lin@@ ation to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia include oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , disper@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) -@@ inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ ox@@ if@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ lic , s@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fo@@ lic antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympathy such as beta block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and reserves the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ al counter@@ balance can be weak@@ ened or missing . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on re@@ productive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin is excessive in human breast milk , but generally insulin is neither absorbed into breast milk , nor will it be res@@ or@@ tioned after oral use . &quot;
&quot; the following are known from clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their appearance ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data is not in@@ valuable ) . &quot;

severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ cose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a trained person or treated by a doctor by a doctor .
&quot; after a glu@@ cose extraction , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the cause of serious hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glu@@ cose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as the inhibit@@ ing of glu@@ cose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that they occur faster in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sation of the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu@@ g@@ man@@ em normal insulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus showed insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosing range from 0,0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ate rise in glu@@ cose levels , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine has twice as fast efficiency as normal human insulin and achieves full glu@@ cose levels about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; from the data it was apparent that a comparable post@@ pran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control occurs , such as a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin removal was achieved 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ di@@ ale control was achieved as with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin removal is applied 15 minutes after the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as for human normal insulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - gro@@ oves before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin Resist@@ ant ( G@@ LU@@ LIS@@ IN - before ) before beginning of meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before beginning of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
insulin Resist@@ ant ( G@@ LU@@ LIS@@ IN - subsequently ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin that was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
