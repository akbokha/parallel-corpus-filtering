<seg id="5">"• Bipolar-I-disorder, psychic disorder, in which the patients of manic episodes (periods of abnormal high-mood) have alternated with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat medium to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders when oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"for both diseases, the solution to insert or melt tablets in patients can be applied to the swallowing of tablets difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who take other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify should be adapted accordingly, the dose of Abilify should be adapted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impaired the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazl probably works mainly as a partial agitation for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called Serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazl is like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in less dimensions than the neurotransmitters, to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazl contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, causing mental or manic symptoms and prevents their recovery."</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been investigated in three studies about up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that were compared to a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injecting solution was in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased anxiety caused by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change of the symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absorbs the enamel tablets and the solution for embedding (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injecting solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than patients who received placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased anxiety and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled swallowing), vomit (tremors), vomiting, nausea (nausea), vomiting, nausea (nausea), anxiety and exhaustion, insomnia, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from mid-heavy to heavy manic episodes with Bipolar-I-disorder, as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were predominantly manic episodes and with those of the manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazole, were overhauled against the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee concluded that the benefits of injecting solution in rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder when oral therapy is not suitable to overweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission shared Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for approval of Abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the Bipolar-I- disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for abilify amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a conservation dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"an increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for abilify is 15 mg once daily regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is set out of combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases following the beginning or after change of an antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with Aripiprazl (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">"results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazl compared to other antipsychotics."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazl should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemia heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypoglycaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including akzelerated and maligne form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, one year or less, there were occasional reports on the treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if patients with abilify treated signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia, should be taken into consideration, reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a mutation, or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including abilify, must be set."</seg>

<seg id="47">"in general, a weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidites, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is known as a side effect, and may lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazl on the central nervous system, caution is required if Aripiprazl is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 Antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazl, whereby this effect is not considered clinically."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazl by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects, and therefore should have similar dose reductions."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with abilify, the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for patients."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV proteaseininhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions."</seg>

<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body can not produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in case of type 2 diabetes, in which the body can not be processed effectively, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance glycosyliated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how good blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study with adults with type-1 diabetes, after six months, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% at insulin-spro."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% at human normal insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic to insulin-lulisine or one of the other components, or for patients who are already suffering from a hypoglycaemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra may have to be adapted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission shared Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH a permit for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal ceiling, thigh or delta, or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of the abs."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced glucose capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of the effect, the brand (Her- manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delay, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in insulin needs."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 A insufficient dosage or break of treatment, in particular in patients with an insular diabetes, can lead to a hyperglycaemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of a hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the inclination to hypoglycemia include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) -Hemmer, disperoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) -inhibitors, pentoxifyllin, propoxylic, salizylate and sulfolic antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, under the effect of sympathy such as beta blockers, clonidin, Guanethidin and reserves the symptoms of adrenal counterbalance can be weakened or missing."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisine and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth or post-natal development (see Section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin is excessive in human breast milk, but generally insulin is neither absorbed into breast milk, nor will it be resortioned after oral use."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"the following are known from clinical trials, grouped according to system organclasses and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their appearance (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the available data is not invaluable)."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"cold sweat, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or Tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration disorders, lightheads, headaches, nausea and heart knobs."</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will be missed to continuously change the injection point within the injecting area can occur in the sequence of a lipodystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with untramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg) which is given by a trained person or treated by a doctor by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after a glucose extraction, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the cause of serious hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as the inhibiting of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that they occur faster in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lulisation of the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hugmanem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type-1 diabetes melli- tus showed insulin-lulisine in the therapeutically relevant dosing range from 0,075 to 0,15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate rise in glucose levels, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisine has twice as fast efficiency as normal human insulin and achieves full glucose levels about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"from the data it was apparent that a comparable postprandiale glycaemic control occurs, such as a human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"insulin removal was achieved 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandiale control was achieved as with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"insulin removal is applied 15 minutes after the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved as for human normal insulin, which is given 2 Mi- grooves before the meal (see Figure 1)."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"insulin Resistant (GLULISIN - before) before beginning of meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before beginning of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B)."</seg>
