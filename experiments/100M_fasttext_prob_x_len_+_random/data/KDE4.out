&quot; the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; conc@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &quot;
for more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions refer to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or .
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select Settings extensions ... Open the card card tools and select the required modules . &quot;
this is a list of standard configuration modules from the bundle ; add@@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the base k@@ de@@ base , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click on Tools . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or the list of crashes , if available , delete . &quot;
&quot; you can also call &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; the module allows you to filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; change the current working directory to different kind . &quot;
&quot; to use the DOM tree view im &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Tools DOM tree ... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the DOM of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; fs@@ view ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; another view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory is used in local files . it can be used as an alternative to the various symbol and text views so that you can view the content of your local file system .
&quot; each object is represented by a rec@@ t@@ angle whose surface is propor@@ tion@@ ately to its size . each object is represented by a rec@@ t@@ angle whose surface is propor@@ tion@@ ately to its size . this size has to have the property , that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of a object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; fs@@ view ; the size of a file or folder , the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; fs@@ view ; an entry in the Tre@@ e@@ Map view is a rec@@ t@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for simpler navigation , the rectang@@ les have meaningful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rec@@ t@@ angle which is switched on View Color mode , can either be a depth for easy detection of the sh@@ ading depth or the illustration of another file owner such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rec@@ t@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if sufficient space to display is present or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rectang@@ les should be used ( i.e. , if the area of subordin@@ ate rectang@@ les may occur ) , you can specify the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rec@@ t@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; if the layout algorithm for Tre@@ em@@ aps should be respected that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ e@@ Map in &amp; fs@@ view , this objective is not always respected . &quot;
&quot; as divi@@ ding the surface of an entry to the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation will be left to the implementation . here it is possible to create rectang@@ les that are as square as possible . the best methods of this are lines , columns or rec@@ ur@@ sive branches . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum placed area for an entry through the menu entry mode . instead , a pattern pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ated entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; fs@@ view ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map @-@ wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;

&quot; although &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
improved database with much more met@@ adata such as &amp; eg ; on camera or lens that can be searched .
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement opportunities . &quot;
&quot; if you are using this link , your web browser will open a page in the bug report system . if you are using these links , your web browser opens up a page in the bug report system . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , then we would like to answer any questions of other users . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ K@@ am ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ K@@ am .
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and database . you can select a local , remote or remote folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data file will be saved . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later you can add as many folders as you want to add . &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , you can also use as Al@@ ben@@ Library . settings digi@@ K@@ am &quot;
&quot; if you already have a collection of images on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder containing images as base folders . &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; looks at each sub@@ folder as an album . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; seeking recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders , unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folders . this allows you to insert a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums will have no photos as symbols . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; you should use your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My albums and my keywords to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; support is based on the li@@ bra@@ id library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you can find a list of supported raw cameras in the help of raw camera support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h decoder settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; a simple to use camera interface will be available to you so that you can connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; of course each medium and any card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ K@@ am . &quot;
modern digital cameras capture the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) are used for the actual transmission to the computer . the camera appears as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . the connection can also be used via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; using the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras , which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transm@@ issions via serial port , this connection is now outdated . &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read the thumbnail images from digi@@ K@@ am . if the thumbnail support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see preview images or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules :
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier to add &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; by writing a small module to add a function , when the changes to &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; themselves . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images works everywhere : you can specify a picture in another part of the tree , above the horizontal divi@@ ding line or in another application window . the only limitation is that a picture may not be displayed in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to extract the most common one : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Movies and Audio &quot;
the text filter is used only for the fields used in the symbol view .
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos that have been created by &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; these albums can be stored in a single album tree , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date that the album has been created first , the date can be changed in the features of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . &quot;
&quot; in order to copy or move a picture from an album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . you can move on the same way as you move or copy them . simply select all photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , click on the album and edit the album menu item menu . &quot;
Alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view album By Date .
&quot; the buttons El@@ dest , average , new ester : this set the date to the oldest , the latest image or the section of the album . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file will be used in this folder instead . &quot;
&quot; if you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , the first image in the album is shown as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ ak ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo album is not representative and you want to choose another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and click on the context menu &amp; quot ; as Alb@@ um@@ preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;

&quot; information about each image are displayed below the corresponding preview . what information is , you can change over settings digi@@ K@@ am . select the album page and adjust the range of thumbnail images to your preferences . &quot;
&quot; the preview pictures feature help window , which appear . if you can rest the mouse po@@ inter at a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the section introduction to the main window shows such help window . &quot;
&quot; images are all , wor@@ rying about &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; go . albums and keywords allow you to organize your images as it suits you . you can access all the features that can be done with &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; you can access all the features that can be done with &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; you can view all the features that can be done with &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; you have the choice between the viewing of pictures , a slide show or editing the images . &quot;
&quot; you can open the images using a photo , calling either F@@ 4 image Edit ... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit the context menu of the image with the right mouse button . &quot;
&quot; it may occur that &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the sub@@ menu of opening with the right mouse button , and how to customize it to your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not save that data from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IPTC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way to click on the preview and select rotate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the file name of a file , you can click the right mouse button on the preview and F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want a photo from &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; delete , it will be moved to the M@@ ül@@ mer von &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Bild Delete or Un@@ f If you prefer to really delete you , you can use this by using Shift ; emp@@ f . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the data collection so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and cat@@ alog@@ ise your photos .
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . in this way , you can log@@ ically organize your keywords . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , but you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking on the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or click on an existing keyword , and then select new keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking the right mouse button and select Delete . if you delete a keyword , the photo will not be deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a stit@@ ch by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then , a menu that gives you the opportunity to move the keyword . keyword can be a time only once in the tree . &quot;
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on the right mouse button and edit it in the context menu item . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must select the image with the right mouse button and click on the context menu as Alb@@ um@@ preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done on two ways : once you have chosen the photos you want to use with keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is shown once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . on this way , you can keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have signed a photo with keywords , this is displayed in the main window of the image . &quot;
you can delete a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photos and select from the menu menu from the menu . the menu shows you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo .
&quot; the time light view shows a time @-@ dependent adjustment of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved by this hi@@ sto@@ gram . to select a time frame you only need to click on the lower rec@@ t@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . thus all associated images are displayed in the main window . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it will appear in the list below . &quot;
&quot; all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and the future still more . &quot;
&quot; the search box is a small lamp that will be green when searching for results . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all pictures will be displayed again . if you search nothing , the lamp will be red . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you can open this , you can find a simple search box as described above . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is done . the results will be displayed in the View menu in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching again , you need to select the corresponding entry from the View menu and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select a search , the form will appear to enter the search with the previously entered search information . if you select as an advanced search , the dialog will appear for the extended search to change your previous search . here you will find more information in the section The Tools for Advanced Search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select the context menu search . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced Search provides you an advanced search form with many search parameters , which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the album database . all rules are added to the list / search group . each option can be added to other via the logical operations All ... , A ... , No ... or At least ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar . by means of a sw@@ elling , the results can be enlarged or reduced . if you move a picture from anywhere on the icon of un@@ ch@@ ew@@ ing search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sketch : free @-@ hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; find the appropriate pictures . here a sw@@ elling value can be set .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marb@@ le mini program . you can move it in or out with the mouse wheel . push C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move to a square . all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed , and this requires your images to contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L to add the light table from the context menu .
&quot; from the preview bar you can drag the images you want to see in the left or right area of the window and place there . a small arrow shows you what a copy in which window area is to be seen . if you want to preview from the tool@@ bar and perform the zoo or shoot operations on one of the images , you can compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to extract quickly from a picture series . if you are using Pa@@ ar@@ wise to navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for comparing it . this makes it easier to navigate through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , normal soldering can also work directly from the light table , e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit .... &quot;
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the light table . this makes it possible to combine visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you find a built @-@ in swing function , which you can see on the crossed paths . in order to keep the visible area of the image , you need to click this click and the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will show the same image . &quot;
zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use zoom control under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out . this happens in both images when you are in the mode .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - apart from the modem ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been made up to the final edition and permanent storage . each of the photos is recorded , scans or digital photos records a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how you can find your pictures , use and use photos . we focus on the process for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am . we focus on the process for digital photographer the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am . we focus on the process for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; met@@ adata are defined as data on data . met@@ adata are specified in accordance with your definition , information about or documentation of other data provided by an application or environment . &quot;
&quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need no inventory management for a particular photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use not &amp; digi@@ K@@ am . &quot;
&quot; you must decide if other access to your photos should be organized on your computer . you must decide if other access to your photos should have to be stored on your computer , or on a network drive &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; vacation pictures can be found on the same location in one year . if you do enough photos , you will be able to print sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archiving , workflow , constant feed of images on different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % of archives and 5 % of the working files are created and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ adata option in the setting page of the met@@ adata in &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; to enable EX@@ IF@@ - and IPTC data to the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the met@@ adata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what is happening ? &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , as you should now have any photo keywords , lettering and an evaluation . of course , you can select all images that need the same attribute and then set the value . you start best with the rating or ranking . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
&quot; if you import kat@@ alog@@ ised images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; automatically build the tree for you , or insert the images to the right place . &quot;
&quot; the graph shows how different met@@ adata can be cut . this is a very rough representation , as each block of met@@ adata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ame and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alog@@ ise your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; you want most of your photos to be seen simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I tell you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach , in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to be an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is the importance of the viewer to help him about the motive that you are moving to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it &apos;s the strength only with an in@@ scription for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , you can save as much text in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as a lab@@ eling . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now running with light speed . &quot;
&quot; I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can easily repeat your travel by means of geographical information . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information can be stored in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; as information :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and writer ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , e.g. to protect the name of the photographer , for example to use the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization may be used . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples can be the title as : employee photographer , freelance photographer , independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who does the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press , these organizations can be listed here that you can see the picture . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill out the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . &quot;
the digital watermark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : disk error , record loss , power violations , ECC , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that are lost on the street or a fire . this type of losses are the same that can happen with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
&quot; in order to combat the problem of CDs / DVDs , these should be dealt with and you may not be longer than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . &quot;
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable but you can use this risk in which you can use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable .

&quot; do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
Disk@@ manufacturer reserve your statistics for yourself . your manufacturer &apos;s anti@@ bodies comprise a new disk but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : disc@@ er@@ ase study
&quot; in short : dis@@ ks keep the longest if you are operated in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at low temperature levels , the error rate increases dramatically . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; this can cause serious damage during most electric devices . this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high speed processors . this can cause serious damage . on your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage to your computer , so you can protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs the amount of energy and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar , but remember that not every connector bar contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a particular minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; as a over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all periph@@ er@@ als that are connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers represent a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a non @-@ inter@@ ruption @-@ free power supply .
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . some models allow them to keep track of the same quality requirements as a over@@ voltage protection . moreover , the lifetime of the battery and the included software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; this is only a small price difference if you think how well your computer is protected . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before you go to holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software . &quot;
&quot; you are compared to the hard drives home , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; gt ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; gt ; 500 . in addition , you must send data about the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are stored on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your images in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered until you open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source for transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ rup@@ tions within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transfer issues , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle and highly scal@@ able with plate errors . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it is also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its B@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms to use the z@@ fs , and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel . &quot;
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % at the workplace systems .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than the masters . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or re @-@ install@@ ations@@ . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has been no longer sigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; open Source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , just the speed of the investigation process in a sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . this means that while technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this boundary .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras go in direction of 10 megapixel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final result rather deteri@@ or@@ ated . a sensor size of 6 megapixel and high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full size sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anyone other for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss , so secure your data often on a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the size of your hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose , then one day , a flash hits you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data dangerous enough . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up stairs , into the neighbouring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup which is not available immediately , then you can save it one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files must be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential security : a backup of the files has been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot of two points : the complete backup and the final differentiation .
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files has been changed since last backup . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made . this backup comes with an ver@@ sion@@ ing system next to the exception , which is only cancelled and not continued . &quot;
&quot; r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that really changed . &quot;
save important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium .
&quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . &quot;

&quot; thus valuable images survive the next 40 years , that &apos;s about the time span that you really are interested in you because they are interested in your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be noted : &quot;
&quot; since the future is unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able because of your nature , you need to look at all what is said today . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size .
&quot; with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and store it onto a new disk : &quot;
&quot; check with the d@@ mes@@ g command if your new record has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; you might want to change the Directory as well if you need to have your uploaded images placed in e.g. &quot; &quot; www / gallery / &quot; . &quot; &quot;
open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software anymore that can read it then you can create them . this task is easier for year to year .

DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a licensed and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to use met@@ adata . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to use met@@ adata .
&quot; this is perhaps one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe &apos;s XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology has introduced to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file yourself . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive a original of your recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP is used as it stores the met@@ adata separately from the image file . therefore , you should consider if you use DNG as container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata standards that provide a large range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I include working on a architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enlighten@@ ing efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures on the camera are available , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for complex editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images with &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these have been cut off from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark . export them only in web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ K@@ am . in the add of a photos to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and switch it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface , you try to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ ential indicator at the bottom and the preview images of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not display any preview images . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ame and a symbol for the view of each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera will appear . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need camera information about each entry . with the page strips properties and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras not all information is available . &quot;
&quot; this information is the same as in the met@@ adata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; or the image gallery . note that these met@@ adata are not available at some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click to download and then download all photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ K@@ am . download the photos from their camera to a single album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired settings from &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you have selected the photos , you can download the download and then download selected photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New download will be available . these pictures are now not checked by &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; downloaded the new pictures with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , you will of course only download the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the buttons All download or download selected download , a dialog box will appear in which the photos will be stored . the list of existing albums will be displayed , such as normal folders . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all once by del@@ eting the button Delete All . if you just want to delete a few , you must select it first and delete selected selected items . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to delete photos that you have deleted from the camera , but you should carefully check if the photos are successful in a &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; -@@ album downloaded before you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to completely delete it from the camera , this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ame is normally used again after the photos are deleted from the camera . therefore , it can be useful , the date and time when the image has been made into the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ folders . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically create a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; the options during the transmission will open three additional options that will be done before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied into the IPTC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to use another file format as the standard format , e.g. in the editing field the pre@@ fix will be fot@@ o- % y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ame in small letters . or in upper@@ case letters if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; for a photo , is displayed below the name shown in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of the recording to perform automatic rotation during loading . not all cameras provide this information . in the section of the page bar , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded into the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic turning is normally turned on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the button extension and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera information about the date on which the photo has been made available , &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; this sub pages are based on the image data . all images with the same date will be uploaded into the same sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in that case &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to use this option . &quot;
&quot; the simpl@@ est way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button . select upload . select upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
&quot; GPS ( Global Positioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means that a position is meant by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten it later , where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; users want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ k@@ am ; users want to locate the location of the photo so it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 is supported by many GPS data fields such as direction , saddle and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there are currently no cameras that have integrated GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;

&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format , since this is the only format that is supported by the ge@@ ographic mapping module . &quot;
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo

&quot; the loss @-@ free JPEG @-@ 2000 files can save you loss @-@ free . even if you choose the los@@ sl@@ ess setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ adata was not yet supported , but found in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , the images can only be a picture viewer for photos . at the moment , it is very quick to change a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the images . &quot;
&quot; when you use this option , you solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option is a little bit soft , eliminating the 2x@@ 2 grid patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed colour balance which was photograph@@ ed on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . the use of the second sensor has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps have more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the nic@@ est , so the parts of your images are burned , because of the in@@ ability of your camera to catch up as a transparent white . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; and d@@ cra@@ t try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option to re@@ construct the option , you will get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each picture . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to put it somewhat higher than the standard 1 , but this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; to keep the time for the de@@ os@@ a@@ icing is small , you should proceed to conservative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the particle data generated by the color @-@ filtered image sensor . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color re@@ design .
&quot; after some tests it looks like if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ic Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ m . it produces color art@@ ef@@ acts to the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting , if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a correction correction since you are performed during the conversion . &quot;
&quot; a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given back . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; information such as color information from a color space in the others , so the colors are as accurate as possible . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; color Profile Folder S@@ etting here the folder , e.g. / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; check this folder during the start . &quot;
the ICC profiles you have here the opportunity &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed later when opening the raw file .
&quot; the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your pictures will not manage the entire screen . &quot;
&quot; the input profiles should be made to the camera holder and model that you are using . not all profiles are created on the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color mapping or gam@@ ma@@ correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ t G@@ amma correc@@ ts not for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile where you can em@@ ulate your image from one device . this is very useful , before you can print the image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may be very saturated . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious that the colour profile is intended for what is provided for . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ officially : &quot;
&quot; the Canon Profile extension lets you recognize the style of the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for portraits , N for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; ki@@ pi is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing is supported . by delivering this interface , &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; many modules that have been written to work together with any program that supports the ki@@ pi interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the ki@@ pi modules , see a list of available modules . &quot;
short commands for tasks specified by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Short commands .
more information ( in English ) via ki@@ pi modules can be obtained via the ki@@ pi project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the ki@@ pi modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust the time between the transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the camera features show a list of all supported cameras on the left side . on the right side there is a button Automatic detection , which is trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( I@@ EEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active when you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera field . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / removable , specify on which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can manually set camera model and port manually . after you have set your camera , your camera appears in the camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . if you own more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot;
&quot; with the confirmation dialog for shifting &gt; images in the M@@ ül@@ ll@@ mer , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections delete a photos and delete an album you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be still@@ ed by &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , if you use the option changes in the right side bar without any feedback . otherwise , you have to use the changes to the button changes . &quot;
you can also support the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; when starting off . this acceler@@ ates the start process by &amp; digi@@ K@@ am .
&quot; this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; if something from the base folder has been deleted , asks &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; if something is deleted from the base folder . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is counted below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , you will find more information about this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; contains a quick image gallery with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to improve the preview of a image , or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry . &quot;
&quot; the Slider window contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , so you are not part of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ame , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the upper edge and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
&quot; the editing functions of the images will change your photos . however , no of the functions will change the original photo before you save the file or save the button Save from tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file saving as well .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore File menu , or use the button The button Rest@@ ore the Slider Rest@@ ore the Slider Properties in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last saving . &quot;
&quot; almost any action of the images can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed , by selecting reverse or re @-@ produced by selecting the Rest@@ ore from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; when you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; click the tool@@ bar button for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed respectively restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the jQuery Slider , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have changes on the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can zoom in and out into the photo in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the view menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fication factor &quot;
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode .
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image and receive the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print several images or whole sets . all image preview pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu label export printer assistant . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; main window has a side bar at the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected pictures . the same side bar is , without the navigation path , also available in the jQuery Slider . &quot;
multiple clicks on the same tab allow the side@@ bar to appear and disappear again .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IPTC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters .
&quot; after you have commented it , use the button to turn off or switch to the next image , the lab@@ eling will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Use button , there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . &quot;
&quot; the section review shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the review is written in the IPTC @-@ Field Review . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword @-@ view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this &amp; digi@@ K@@ am . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can limit the number of ways to search for keyword quickly . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have different keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the respective check fields in the tree . all the keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC fields .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this only applies to the above image and not to the entire selection , if you want to select a selection with keyword , please read the keyword filter . &quot;
&quot; the page bar keyword filter is used to change the pictures displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - data , keyword and search . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop off . suppose you have selected several images in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put on the selection . then a dialog box will appear if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper instance , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . &quot;
this search for changes will take place at any start of the program .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and notice that it would be one or its , you can easily change it with double @-@ click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , key term , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can set a Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need the check box at the end of the rule and afterwards the button group@@ ing . the options see as follows : &quot;

this article / Tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted to &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow , the colors shown by your camera or sc@@ anners are showing a predictable vari@@ ance of the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or sc@@ anners . you can print or publish the colors you print or publish them from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about colour management . in addition , links with deeper information enable you to make your own informed decisions so that you can obtain the desired results . &quot;
&quot; if your images meet all six of the criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you work on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( more information can be found below )
your only other image editions are by email or web where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ fac@@ to standard .
&quot; so if s@@ RGB is so well functioning and the life for everyone is so easy , why should one use another color space and make sure that you have to think about colour management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colours that we can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colours in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms on info and then click on Information About RGB working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to calibr@@ ate my monitor when I decided to work in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! if you work in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to calibr@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB of it is that your ; monitor to s@@ RGB is calibr@@ ated . if you are used as a color space of s@@ RGB , you must either use your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , using a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions which can be improved in most cases .
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alize , Acc@@ ept , Automatic Ab@@ ility and Con@@ contrast from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ation Automatic correction will attempt automatically from your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see what is best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ rolls the lumin@@ ous values over the whole picture so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; this method adju@@ sts the brightness ratio of the selected image , so that the hi@@ sto@@ gram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . &quot;
&quot; automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . &quot;
&quot; contrast : this method improves the contrast and the brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values in between the lowest and highest values in between . this is only visible in balanced images , and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can do the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better off . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hi@@ sto@@ gram .
&quot; using a button , you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum will appear . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your score depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
&quot; if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. you will see the combined result in the white balance . this is displayed as a pure indicator , and has no effect on the final image . &quot;
&quot; the buttons Save as and Load are exactly this . every setting of the white balance that you have set , you can store them in a text file and re@@ load them later . &quot;
the button pres@@ ets pres@@ ets all filter values back to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings can be created as your original . if you save them your original image will be changed .
&quot; you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 bit encoding is better for high @-@ quality images . this encoding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw images . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , allowing you to use them for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always make the same mistakes and you always need the same correction . in the manual for the correction correction you will find more information . &quot;
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under paints gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; tool color effects provides four color effects , a solar system effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a Ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar @-@ ization was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of the result of a short fl@@ ashing light and then completed the development of the picture . the colour , darker areas protected the delicate photographic paper from the additional light . this was a part of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; the intensity control the solar cells . at about 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot;
this is an example of the solar system . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vid @-@ Filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ oth ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours brilliant and glow . try it simple , it em@@ bel@@ lish many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ oth . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ oth ; and thus a reference for its smooth texture . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contra@@ sts .
&quot; the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates neon light at the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repe@@ ats the thickness of the neon light . in large images , the filter can re@@ lie@@ ve the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras have frequently encountered problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to change the colour contrast and the brightness of the photos . you can look at the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu . as soon as you are happy with the results , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes you can perform in the preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ch@@ iness / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set to improve exposure . even if the dialog on this tool is very complicated , you need only the range of sliders . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hi@@ sto@@ gram , the active channel or the selected range . under the graph there are three sliders into the left and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controller and make sure the image changes .
&quot; on the right side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be dynamically , based on the settings of the image , and the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set whether the hi@@ sto@@ gram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . in this case , the linear hi@@ sto@@ gram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is useful . &quot;
&quot; three controllers : the highest for the dark tones , the mean for the bright tones and the lowest for medium sounds , often called Gam@@ ma@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ points can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and light tones . moreover , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons you can store the set values in the file system and re@@ loaded back later . this is used to use the Gim@@ p Levels format .
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the Hi@@ sto@@ cking System for Rot@@ - , Green , Blue and the L@@ umin@@ ana channels . &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator which means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
&quot; below you can see an example of the adjustment of input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand , half of the original and the target image is displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically based on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this selection box allows the channel to be changed from the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , two icons are located between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . in this case , the linear mode of the meaningful color creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; if you move a cur@@ sor to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones will correspond with darker output holes and that the corresponding image pixel will be darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos a red marker is shown . if you want to change this marking on the range you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that is the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and later loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; if you want this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , you automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sunlight . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; if more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; jQuery Slider is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shade of the photos .
the channel mixer is another advanced tool for mixing the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color channel mixer of the images .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can choose the colour for the hi@@ sto@@ gram : this gives you a first indication as you can correct the can@@ als by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own riders . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hi@@ sto@@ gram to show you the corresponding colour value . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are right below : control for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you are able to keep L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will also keep the general brightness even if you are also using the option Mon@@ och@@ rom , since the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mono@@ chrome , the reduction of color to a visible noise that comes from the color channel . colour glasses consists of small noise arti@@ facts that will not appear in the same place in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel may appear differently . if this is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rom conversion in which you can reduce the color space . &quot;
&quot; save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any set of mixer settings can be saved for later , and then load . the file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format . &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator which means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .

&quot; green filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , in all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 Co@@ kin ( tm ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( tm ) orange filter . &quot;
red filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Co@@ kin ( tm ) gel filter .
&quot; Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm light and medium sounds while it adds a little cold in the sh@@ ading dun@@ es . this is very similar to the process of a pressure and re @-@ development in a sept@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother , and thus similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( tm ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture using the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am .
&quot; by adding a texture to your picture , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged dots or as a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for this purpose . &quot;
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimensional texture of the texture on the picture .
a paper texture is applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; add tool frame to add a decorative frame around a picture .
the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is no easy task . an opportunity to keep his attention is to set up a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ aking eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image .
width : gives the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into an image at any location . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and character set with its properties as you need them . &quot;
&quot; every setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . after the image has been stored , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; tool sten@@ cil , you can apply a template on a picture . &quot;
the picture template can be used in the images to place templates on a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no restrictions concerning size and orientation . however , you need to add the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the size of the template . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your shrink folder with the button base folder in dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the shot files . these settings will be noticed for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder for the templates has been set , a construction view that reflects the folder structure of the Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ folder is displayed . the selection of a folder is updated automatically . &quot;
three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; if you want to use the template on the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the template on your image . the picture is then adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; three different tools are available for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but produces especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and is protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
&quot; re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three , as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting . &quot;
images without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness .
photos in raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
&quot; if you disable this , you get the control over your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing work@@ piece . you can then scroll through the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; however , you should be c@@ auti@@ ous because the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also rein@@ forces the noise . in general , the most suitable technique to shar@@ pen the tool is re@@ focuss@@ ed . you can reach it via the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ation . you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw a little bit soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool to draw a little bit soft , and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter is a very good tool to remove mu@@ te from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the preview window shows the output of the filter with current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first try out first . an increase in the radius or the amount rein@@ force the effect . &quot;
&quot; the radius , like many pixels on each side of a channel by the filter . high resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . they should therefore shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution . &quot;
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wis@@ ely image , which is added to the original . thus the thickness of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold value is a fra@@ ction of the maximum RGB value and the difference @-@ sum . one can thus define a minimum difference to a channel of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft exchange between the sounds are exemp@@ t from the sharpen@@ ing and therefore avoid mis@@ understand@@ ings in faces , Himm@@ ler and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp m@@ asked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . bl@@ urred m@@ asked was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; tool re@@ focuss@@ ing a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness .
this is a better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener filtering . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener filtering . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener filtering .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folds . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result from the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original qu@@ el pixel . &quot;
&quot; it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value is 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values are close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filters : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor@@ ly helpful . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value of non@@ zero , you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can generate good results , especially if you choose great values for the circle @-@ shaped sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters that you have set , will be saved for later and can then be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later left un@@ comfortable arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; in general , Un@@ sharp mask produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could result in causing the un@@ sharp mask to use a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp mask must always create art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions , it can never be the effect of the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods for the sharp@@ ness correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the kno@@ bs smooth@@ es the sharp@@ ness of the range that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the ink tin@@ plate allows a customized colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the tools developed in order to remove unnecessary art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by IMA@@ GE team of GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ IM@@ G project .
this tool contains several pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ adjustments are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the tab smooth@@ ness and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail level p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a uniform smooth@@ ness over the image . &quot;
&quot; alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es ev@@ enly across all directions , while a value close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gr@@ illing or CCD noise , a high value of shaft @-@ like patterns can be created . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all . p defines the relative smooth@@ ness . therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your picture . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . &quot;
repeat : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . normally enough 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; the angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic alpha . if alpha small is chosen , it should also be small . &quot;
&quot; integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more of quality that you get through the choice of this option is only low , but it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to release it . &quot;
&quot; the buttons Save as and Load are exactly this . every setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file , and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; correct image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load after moving . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel . &quot;
below you can see how image errors can be removed using small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that in Guatemala City is made with an analog camera . as you see there is a peculiar black Art@@ ef@@ act in the for@@ eg@@ round that caused by a bad movie storage during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a protected algorithm of Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides selectable image filters to remove sta@@ ins and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mos@@ s ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed using this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , only the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ menu Advanced settings can remain with default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius control the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be received and noise or lubrication occurs . &quot;
edges : control the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong it cannot be removed all the noise or noise peaks . set it on a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak ro@@ ar or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
&quot; light density : controls the brightness tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or light density to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process , which is controlled by the details settings . &quot;
&quot; color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or light density to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process , which is controlled by the details settings . &quot;
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ ate tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas which are typically stronger .
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the alignment of the phase j@@ itter absorption . this value defines how fast the adaptive Filter@@ radius re@@ acts on variations of lumin@@ ous density . if it is increased , the edges appear smooth when it is too high , can cause noise and phase j@@ itter on the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is indicated with ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was used with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw a little bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture . use this tool to draw soft signs with the menu entry , showing the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grains , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or later digi@@ ti@@ zed images . &quot;
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ IM@@ G project .
&quot; JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . &quot;
&quot; the buttons Save as and Load are exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file , and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load after moving . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
below you can see how a photo with uniform noise can be restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( tm ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grains on faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures are reduced to an old color photo that has been loaded with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that have been created by scanner lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ contrac@@ tions method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file in the wizard with the dark image . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark image to the image to the corrected image . note that the wizard will see the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview will help you correct the results within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with current settings .
select a field to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels .
&quot; Dur@@ cut : it is calculated on average of the neighbouring pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less pixels are drawn , to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square corners ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) , which then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block . &quot;
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) which then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below , you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; correction correction is a tool for correc@@ ting the vi@@ vi@@ ti@@ sing , i.e. under exposed corners to correct an image . &quot;
&quot; far @-@ angle objective , especially the middle and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead , &amp; quot ; vi@@ g@@ net@@ tier@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there . &quot;
&quot; many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 when the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise un@@ sharpen@@ ing effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure area of today &apos;s filter and colour and film depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using an equivalent transformation on a raw image created without this filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the correction correction filter and three further exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the greatest density . the standard density is 2,0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or acci@@ dental a thickness of 2 . &quot;
&quot; to adjust the target image with these options , you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target with these options , since you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to re @-@ adjust the finish of the target image , then let the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am menu . &quot;
this is an example of vi@@ vi@@ ating correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ vi@@ ation in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous and contrast correction was also performed with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric di@@ stor@@ tions . colour di@@ stor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second gra@@ dation deals the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can fix the conc@@ ave or con@@ vex form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third gra@@ ft has a similar circular effect , but fla@@ ke on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the coefficient of fourth gra@@ des corrected the remote corners opposite to the second gra@@ dient . if you combine these two can be virtually eliminated any geomet@@ ric distortion .
in general : this value controls the thickness of the distortion of the second gra@@ dient .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the fourth gra@@ dient .
&quot; zoom : this value sc@@ rolls the image size , resulting in a correction of the first gra@@ dient due to negative values . &quot;
&quot; bright : this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used for the next start as standard values . &quot;
the barrel or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be carried out before any cutting or size changes .
&quot; to help you find the best correction you will find this tool a vertical and horizontal auxiliary line . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in connection , you can fix the barrel / cushion distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motifs , e.g. recordings from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct the angle in the image 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ web@@ u.@@ org website that is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well known Il@@ ford ( tm ) SF@@ X@@ 200 i@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can set two parameters for movie grains and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the &quot; &quot; Download Output &quot; &quot; option if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film grains and the domin@@ ance of the colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter color channels are bl@@ ended to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filters applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; filter film grains is a simple to use tool to re@@ produce film grains on your images , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to increase the sensitivity of the films , mixing the manufacturer large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use this special , Galerie @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny view especially in your mono@@ chrome photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you still need more grains , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film grain effect on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm of pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brush is better suited for large images .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and Gl@@ ät@@ te 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; filters coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a coal @-@ esk@@ ine . the lines that change the outline in the drawing , are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you . this would be good pictures to start . &quot;
there are two controllers with a range of ranges from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ es ) .
this is an example of the coal label . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; Filter Grav@@ ur pre@@ tends your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm of pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; Filter Grav@@ ur is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , in which color does not the most important of the content . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
this filter group allows you to transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses the copyright protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
waves 1 : divi@@ des the image in cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
the picture may not be used without the permission of the photographer .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using un@@ sharpen@@ ed effects . it uses the copyright protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image along the three @-@ shaped lines . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image by turning the pixels around a focal point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; motion bl@@ ur@@ ry : wi@@ pes the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographic camera , camera . &quot;
&quot; this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos , or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
&quot; bulk solid sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image through random shift of pixels , and simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of an arbit@@ rar@@ ily movable camera . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo in rectangular cells and then , through the filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops onto your picture .
dri@@ p size allows to change the size of the drop . since the dri@@ p size is not automatically growing with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size of the image . number changes the number and density of the drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
&quot; you can keep a range of rain drops using the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am . use the selection tool to select the area , for example a face that should stay free . if you then start the filter , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the regulator filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirr@@ oring or turning into the right orientation . &quot;
photo shooting is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to smaller is simple . the big question is , how can you zoom on a picture and view the details ? how can you zoom into a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached ? how can you find out or guess the missing information ? the C@@ IM@@ G algorithm used here is a good job . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo is the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size is using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to close the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , then try the tool for blowing . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge image . &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by IMA@@ GE team of GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ IM@@ G project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
&quot; maintaining aspect ratio : if this setting is checked , the size ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . &quot;
the buttons Save as and Load are used exactly . each insertion of the photo can be saved as text file and then re@@ loaded .
&quot; photo shooting is very quick with what it makes , but it can take a long time and take a high CPU load after moving . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) is the result of linear default magni@@ fication .
&quot; the cutting of a photo is not only a frequent operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . &quot;
&quot; if you get the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . you can change the size of the area to cut off . a new rec@@ t@@ angle will create a new rec@@ t@@ angle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The trimm@@ ing button of the images in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the preview section , you can change the size of the rec@@ t@@ angle by moving the corners using the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog box will remain . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in high format , the greater value of the height and the width of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timet@@ res , inch or any other physical size . you can see a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist in order to automatically centre the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to cut the area to the maximum possible , depending on the selected relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio saves his settings depending on image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you are using the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut picture and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the compositions help make it easier to embed your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity .
&quot; golden mid : the golden middle is a division that grows on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of an N@@ auti@@ lus shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden pitch is the Ir@@ rat@@ ale number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used for the ancient Egyp@@ tians and Greeks used to create your tem@@ ples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you create your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number leads from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of its two progres@@ sed numbers . &quot;
the golden middle provides more fluid auxiliary lines when you assemble a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the gold spiral will bring you to your goal good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are the central points of the golden rectang@@ les . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles cannot be con@@ gru@@ ent tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can be a static object dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you will create a effect of the professional photographer dynamic symmet@@ ry . try your picture focus on one of the chi@@ ves and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach . &quot;
the options horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic parts .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
free rotation is a tool for turning a picture to any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , it happens easily that you can &apos;t keep the camera exactly vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things around an angle are rot@@ ated . you can repair this with the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; drag and adjust the target angle . &quot;
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . you can set the sliders back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the top right .
&quot; to help your help , the module creates a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview to move the two lines . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have turned a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the function Automatic trimm@@ ing . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . please note the above warning .
this point is shown in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new Height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left upper : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the picture is a little dirty . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after which you have adapted the perspective , you get un@@ fortunate tri@@ angular holes at the corners . &quot;
&quot; the tool is used to move a part of the image into a direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . in other words , a rec@@ t@@ angle is dist@@ orted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; shoot your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can push horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will appear and the new dimensions of the target are displayed on the right of the preview window . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your picture . &quot;
&quot; after which you have done the sh@@ utter , the picture will wi@@ pe out a bit . for a single shot this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two shots are generated twice as much wi@@ per and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after sharpen@@ ing , the image has un@@ attractive tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to remove it is the image with trans@@ verse cutting from the images . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; requires a number of libraries and other packages in order to read and write image formats . the formats available at the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ K@@ am . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependency of other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all available on their system file formats . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; shows only files in formats that are known . this happens by means of the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can view this list of the file extensions that &amp; digi@@ K@@ am . &quot;
&quot; almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras also allow you to select the format to be used . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , supports both formats . &quot;
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced in order to save image data to a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss when it is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; this will see more than 200 raw file formats . all supported cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that are supported by &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; supported : &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; is not a film editing program , and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies . &quot;

many tools you need the photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; their description follows here .
&quot; use a single dialog that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , see &amp; quot ; texture application ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image .
ver@@ tically divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal divi@@ ding without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the lower indicates the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
ver@@ tically divide . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and bottom exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and click on the part of the image you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings depend on the last use of the module .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained by itself . it is group@@ ed into the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data if they are available .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marb@@ le mini program . you can move it in or out with the mouse wheel . push C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move to a square . all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed , and this requires your images to contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ allets . the application can be used for editing color p@@ allets and to use colors .
&quot; the p@@ allets files that are from &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only a user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot User @-@ defined color and Last modified colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ allets or browse the folders to files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as line in the pal@@ let view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the pal@@ let view . here the color name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used too . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to move . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is enabled under the button color , the color is added to the cur@@ sor on the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is selected , you can select by selecting the check box over@@ writing under Bei@@ m C@@ urs@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and paste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; use the following format for data in the cli@@ pboard : for each color of three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line @-@ end character , if there are three numbers in the cli@@ pboard , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of colors can be drawn with the mouse .

&quot; other required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program , which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the graph of the graph . required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the open graph , each in one own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ ers ; without a argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list Last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files are selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can choose a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file is in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ers ; loaded file from another program , the following window will appear : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item settings , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph@@ ite file outside of a running &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; -@@ instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the graph in a sub@@ window of the already current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but it can also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . once again , you can save your choice both save as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph are to be placed on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with one on several pages distributed without header and with another font
you can specify a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or check the program every time .
you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time is required .
&quot; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not ) , or determine when you start your startup . &quot;
&quot; the context menu that normally appears in one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens up further possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z are :
the algorithm defines the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges as possible as possible .
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs . it produces representations in accordance with the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi@@ dimensional scale sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model layout for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs .
&quot; it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cy@@ c@@ lical structures according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should specify the graph file as parameters , and the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can &amp; eg ; the &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms have special options , or change the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ zed ) and uses the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed graph &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs ) .
&quot; if this setting is checked , the overview will be displayed if it is necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;

this module can be used to read and store new pictures from external sources . at present two sources can be used :
scan images : using the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the S@@ ane project or another source such as video streams . so you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and S@@ ane installed .
&quot; if you can open the images images , a dialog box appears between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by using the default values duc@@ r@@ he can replace your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the image accordingly . see the estimated file size is shown in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window will be displayed completely , since some settings will not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the button , you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the target image . here , you can select the compression and type of the image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image . &quot;
screen shots can be created after you have selected in the menu Imp@@ or@@ tier@@ s- &gt; screen@@ shot . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete working area to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , you will read after a short delay , the currently visible workplace . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work areas , you should have to select this delay high enough to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog box displays the target image with the options described above . &quot;

the til@@ pi module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit the met@@ adata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ stit@@ ched of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
&quot; the ki@@ pi module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools for images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo , which are used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can create a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images that you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . in order to load a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with G@@ PX file . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded a automatic correlation is carried out in red . GPS track data are recorded in red time and therefore , the time zone must be converted to the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
&quot; the setting for the maximum time deviation indicates an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation below , the data will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you have no trace data from one place for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this field .
&quot; the options Inter@@ pol@@ ation and Differ@@ ence in min can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ation in a large time difference between camera and GPS is , you can set these limits here and press the button cor@@ related to polish . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be manually set using this dialog . this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same site . since the dialog opens the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ ation can also be found and set by the displayed card . choose the relevant region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Driving this always through until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the height must always be manually selected . the map can always be selected between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the ki@@ pi module , there are ways to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;

this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4@@ .01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted . the rider selection allows you to select all albums that are exported to HTML . you just need to select a large number of albums , including the three buttons on the right side , you can quickly create a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ Preview and the text of the text will appear in the head of the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in the picture . otherwise the picture is displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed . &quot;
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images . select a folder where you can write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML export that contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information will be stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . it also influences the file size . all other settings are also explained . &quot;
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to break the process .
&quot; if the module does not create the pages , the window will not be automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if faults occur during the creation . the web browser will start automatically at the end to view the preview of the gallery . click Close to close the module . &quot;
the ki@@ pi image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
&quot; the ki@@ pi image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as turning , zoom or shifting . the viewer can be used for quick picture display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is shown in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;

&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format , without the usual loss of quality or met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is the size of the file size , since no compression of the color information is taking place . &quot;
the ki@@ pi module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the ki@@ pi module digital camera client has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the email list of the ki@@ pi team under k@@ de @-@ ima@@ ges@@ .com. &quot;
&quot; the ki@@ pi module met@@ adata editor now has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ ima@@ @ k@@ de@@ .org of the ki@@ pi team . &quot;
&quot; with the import function of the met@@ adata module , you can copy data from one image to another . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check ex@@ i@@ v2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the ki@@ pi MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide .
&quot; the MPEG encoding module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create a DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . for burning the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; you first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG di@@ ash@@ au , then you can start the module via ex@@ tras MPEG di@@ ash@@ au . &quot;
the pictures you selected are then recorded under Image Files in the Portfolio . you can also change sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
&quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the image is set below . a low value creates a very sudden , high contrast , very smooth scrolling . &quot;
the background color can be set as next . in doubt you should let it be black . the name and the path of the generated file can be set under name of the MPEG output file .
&quot; if you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . after you adjust all settings to your wishes , you can start a coffee with the button code . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now start a coffee and enjoy the di@@ ash@@ ew if you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a critic appears that co@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right bottom of the button . &quot;
the press assistant allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . this is for example : useful to enhance you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
&quot; with this ki@@ pi module , you can import or convert your images stored in JPEG format in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . a original version of Him is : do not expect the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results !
&quot; first select the RAW file to convert and start the module . the raw image converter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . &quot;
&quot; Tagged Image Format , TIFF , reserves all the information of your image and uses the los@@ sl@@ ess LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
click Start ! and your NEF photos will soon be modified . 포@@ 맷 NEF 회@@ 사 Nikon
&quot; if you choose JPEG format as a storage format , the met@@ adata contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start converting the conversion . if you want to cancel this process , you can use Cancel . &quot;
&quot; the batch processing mode allows you to convert several images to once . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual pictures . however , you have the option to automatically over@@ write existing file . this is helpful if it has been created in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the time stamp . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection .
&quot; proportional ( 1 di@@ m . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ in . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option to customize your image to the screen format . &quot;
not Pro@@ por@@ tional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; print preparation : prepare the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo api@@ ece . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; with this ki@@ pi module , you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program . &quot;
&quot; after which you started the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the images of your chosen images . you can add more pictures using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image you will see a preview of the right page . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and insert them to add the list of the sent pictures .
&quot; with the button images , the selected pictures will be removed from the list of the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected all images , you can open the new message window with the OK button to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you just need to add the addresses and the subject . &quot;
do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of sending e @-@ mails . it might be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and again used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the G@@ Mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after the selection of comments in an attached file , comments can be added to the images in a text file and put the mail . &quot;
&quot; PNG format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the los@@ sl@@ ess formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in JPEG format and are the original files in JPEG format , then the original expression data will be added to the sending pictures . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically shut down so you can view the status messages , searching for errors . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asonic , a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL @-@ transitions option will use very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the fil@@ en@@ ame option will show that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the left lower corner is displayed during the presentation .
the loop option allows you to display the presentation in a final loop . you can then manually edit it with Es@@ c ; Cancel .
the pictures random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . therefore it is not the order of the images in the album .
the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should try this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly select another effect in every transition between the images .
&quot; during the slide , you can access a tool@@ bar at the upper left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner around you . &quot;
&quot; with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the ki@@ pi module time &amp; date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the email list of the ki@@ pi team under k@@ de @-@ ima@@ ges@@ .com . note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;

&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE working surface . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can see the photo album , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , are now available in each group , so in people , places and in the group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered your images and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , viewing the folder structure on your hard drive , and of course viewing the preview pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person only the images are displayed on which both people are visible . through this selection method , you can limit the number of displayed pictures of a few thousand images to some single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view preview images to view the pictures of your area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of its name . &quot;
&quot; in order to display images next to the name , select the button that is right on the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can view the view for each category separately ( if you have no suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must specify the image for each individual person . to do this , you must select the image view window ( in closer detail ) and select the picture for the corresponding person . in the view window you can customize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image will be shown or cut off . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching in the main window , a dialog will appear , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a string in the lab@@ eling or description field , the lettering or descriptions of the images will be searched according to this text . if you want , you can also use a date to be searched for , such as 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here you can see pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather like to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory video . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the lower edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name already says , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar shows another unit . you can switch between the units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar just 10 minutes sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline you can use in the following ways : you can change the displayed item preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will show you the current date of the currently displayed images ) , if you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and the mouse over the ruler of the time bar , i.e. the time information . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; before HTML pages are created , you have to make some settings . these are divided into three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more closely . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the survi@@ cks and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . nour@@ ish information on export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information displayed to the viewer without description . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all pictures are exported . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why this is not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of this page , you can set different resolutions for the images . this allows those who want to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download images for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you have defined . thus , you can search your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if you want to get a larger image bigger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
in this setting range you place the different folders and the URL where your site is saved .
&quot; best of all your HTML files , select a basic folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; once you have created your images , you can check if these really all are visible to the viewer . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be started . the URL you specify here should be the folder . otherwise , the web browser will run in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
a sub@@ folder is created whose name you specify in output folders .
&quot; if you are looking for a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the images . if you have already spent a lot of time on the pictures , recording location , etc . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the menu file export@@ ing ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
&quot; in the following , the dialog for export@@ ing images is described , which you can export through the menu file export@@ ing ... &quot;
the main option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three options available :
&quot; when option Manual to Copy to .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
* Copy all code for jQuery Slider from the HEAD and BODY tags and paste it on your page in the HEAD tag and in the place where you want to have a jquery slider jquery slider slider online or to a local drive for testing you should go to &quot; &quot; Gallery / Publish &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal ZIP files . since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ress the files . if you still want to comp@@ ress it , simply select the export file option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send your friends images , you may not want to send the pictures in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image will be a maximum of 800 pixels . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import@@ ing ... , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then to which folders you want to import photos . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are the category people of the imported file ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is in your database . therefore , you &apos;ll be asked in the third dialog box which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories will match them in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can cancel the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example for this is shown on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse images and view it : if you look like pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your boyfriend , you might want to see all pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) Fest@@ ing the information about your images , above ( 2 ) , through ( 2 ) , through ( 2 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it will take care of your videos . in many places in this manual it is spoken about pictures , but often this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ male backup tools , copy onto a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; in the following section of the User Manual , you will explain the various settings options in the following section of the User Manual . &quot;
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available that you can call on the F1 key and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums for each image . &quot;
see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can choose a lettering and a symbol .
&quot; in this section , sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in dialog options you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group , instead of all groups of a member , as explained in the dialog . &quot;
in the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window you can find a list of sub @-@ categories in the left side of the window .
&quot; this module system is called &quot; &quot; ki@@ pi &quot; &quot; and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the modules . the modules can be used and are not described in this manual , because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules can be used together with one another , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the command line &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t tell me , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via ki@@ pi are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the draw@@ back if you share functions with different applications . &quot;

&quot; the picture may not be used without the permission of the photographer . if your company is not yet listed , you need to make a listing first . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser tells the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category will be an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you have specified in the Settings dialog as category for virtual albums . if you are using the category of people , you will be able to do so , so if you have selected people to view and give the module to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the Settings dialog and select the modules that should be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you can see an example for a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you can browse through your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the picture was recorded , etc . &quot;
&quot; all these ann@@ ot@@ ations can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you wish , you can see these ann@@ ot@@ ations if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text box by defining people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; , since you are always using information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea lies the shifting of images within the list : if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures , the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be shown , so that the names are moved upwards to find and assign them faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each picture , you might want to edit all selected pictures and have these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case simply click on the front and back buttons that are under the preview of the image on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to select all these pictures , and use the menu item for multiple entries at once with a comment . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the ann@@ otation dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub @-@ category . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the ann@@ otation dialog by clicking the bar that form the top edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a window by drag@@ ging it outside of the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , click on the Options button ... , which offers you the opportunity to store the current setup and look of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also create a frame completely . if you want to view this window later , use the options ... and then window a / hide . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures if you don &apos;t have a filter . an example for this is to see the size of the preview images , by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it simply . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; if you click on a picture , this is displayed in the image viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with one image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the relevant images from which you want to delete , or delete the Delete key or select Edit menu . now you will see the window you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; for this problem , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can use the pictures anywhere , that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all images can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; pictures , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , the preview pictures are present , so you can view the preview of these pictures . however , you can view these pictures with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you see , you need to copy files from the folder and paste it again . &quot;
&quot; in the pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with your name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end of those who want to view your little sister , you can also check out all the pictures that you can see for others , and select the menu entry All except for the current view . &quot;
&quot; with this , you have determined what images are to be hidden in the case of the F@@ allen . if you want to give the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , which allows all images that you have blocked . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu Privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please remember that this picture is not very secure . you can access all images on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the file index@@ .@@ xml can be read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to convert the password as un@@ encrypted text ; not very familiar to manage the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; of course , you can spend hours of hours to describe them at some time . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in . it shows , of course , the picture , but additional all the information you have about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can easily move it with the mouse and place somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information will be displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back , using the buttons on the left and the bottom . you can navigate to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run these as a slide . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then you can then press a new image after a few seconds . as often as a new image can be controlled by pressing the Str@@ g key and Plus or Min@@ us . start and stop the slide through the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
&quot; a very useful ability to switch from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; if you can use the viewer , you can zoom in and out into the image . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image will not be displayed . with the DC key , the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel is equal to the screen of a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations work in videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key .
&quot; with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at images it can happen that you &apos;ll find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . in the moment you can view the view and configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . however , you might prefer to check the image and view more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the images on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the images and select them as good or poor@@ ly , while you look at one after another . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to provide images with features while viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you press the corresponding letters . in view a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have added features to your images , you can see them in the browser . &quot;
&quot; categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in dre preview view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letters for the feature after the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the mixture is not stored with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; in order to switch the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then select on the picture from the context menu . to stop the m@@ alen , just press the cross in the tool@@ bar above the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; work , you need to have the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not complete , but documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you have to be read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties properties and the object in the wire model view yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects have already been selected using the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are multiple possible positions , the following fold @-@ up menu will be displayed , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; you can delete selected objects from the scene with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click on cont@@ acting to take these changes . if you have invalid values , a message will be corrected with a error description . then you can correct the error message and reject the changes . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the Setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the Property View and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . as default the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to ren@@ ew a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally . &quot;
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and it will appear a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and turning as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse inside the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a visibility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object , or as absolute value . objects will only appear when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the chosen visibility level of the scene . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window arrangement , or if you need another arrangement , you can adjust it as desired . you can also store multiple window profiles and switch between different configurations . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window over or under a present view , drag the corners to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rec@@ t@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the reader to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to assign multiple views over one another , drag the reader into a different view . you can then switch between views through clicking on the map card button on the top of the page@@ views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window order is floating Views : views , which are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the facade to the desktop or click on the small left arrow in the facade bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the connector bar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any type of page@@ views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with view window order ... save . it will display a dialog where you can save the window system under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ew them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be installed correctly . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ew the current scene , click the Ren@@ ders icon icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry scene . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to ren@@ ew a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can choose any number of R@@ ender modes , from a fast preview to full pictures of highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon The render settings in the tool@@ bar or in the View of R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... select , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each channel mode has a name . you can enter any name , make sense , but a name that lets the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map file size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to ren@@ ew only a small area of the image , select the cross section and enter the image editing for rendering to the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination with quality you can choose the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user retro @-@ reflective lighting . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , various errors can arise . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stage effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing , to reduce the impact of this error . in general , pictures with this property are better . &quot;
&quot; when you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive , because each pixel is still further split and adap@@ tively because each pixel depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixel , which can be followed individually and set up further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another possibility to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called j@@ it@@ tering . if you switch j@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular pattern . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of the rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; , diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this card card you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the related rays have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason for this here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; not yet complete commands of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when import@@ ing error messages or warnings , a dialog window shows a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to import source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , write this source text between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ end . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on the Help in the Property View , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User documentation for the displayed object . click here the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ field data ) in paths to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you will also need to register the path to these files . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the right angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type characteristics .
&quot; you can set the object of the dots to the grid in the context menu of the wire model page@@ views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values provide a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the level of detail for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross High Detailed Events for advanced proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided when the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced proj@@ ections include a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; if you indicate a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a box pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the floor , a floor will be lowered underneath the objects . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you enable edge blas@@ ph@@ em@@ y , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and threshold value can be set . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window profiles or create new window profiles . in the window list below , how to create and save window profiles . &quot;
the combination field standard window system : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of window profiles shows all existing window profiles . a new arrangement allows you to create and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clearly and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the selected window order . new views can be added with the button and delete selected views with the button .
&quot; the position of the new window . create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing windows , with box card , you can create a map card view together with the previous view and sliding table view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; installed and now you would like to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , under beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings , before you complain about it as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not adjust the camera , no rules for rendering can be applied as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything correctly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window order : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can expect an adequate presentation of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will often need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu item . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the content of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , please find further details . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions , but note that the camera is in view of control points you can change the destination point of the camera . simply click on a control point and drag it to the desired point . &quot;
&quot; if you press the button or press the button , the wire model views and the object tree will change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could , for example , insert a qu@@ ader ( insert final body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an easy way to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite layer as a floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and press the button or click the button . in the object tree the new name will appear immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view also shows the level , if even at the moment only as a limited endless plane . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the level extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will find only the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should shift the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shifting and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; just select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little bit in the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog box will open in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments only shows a matte black material because you can still use settings for the pigment . always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with one click on the preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a color on qu@@ ader and ball in the preview , just click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now correctly adjusted . if you ren@@ ame your image with one click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; this entry twice ( you can also do this also more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select every single colour and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; you should already do this step , as you should have understood the basic functioning of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; already understood . the ball can be just as simple as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or button fastening ) , so that the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise the ball would float above the floor , since you have moved the floor to a unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ dern is now a strange result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . put it in the following step as a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to you now . as already at the bottom , give the ball a pigment as a color : &quot;
&quot; choose the first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on the pigment , then select one colour and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take time to set some finish features :
then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press Enter .
&quot; the brightness effect and reflection result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chromed surfaces even if metallic : not yet selected : &quot;
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities are you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; it offers . hopefully you have already lear@@ nt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ sourcing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing , the ren@@ derer hypothe@@ tic rays escape from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender calcul@@ ates the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will affect pixels . &quot;
&quot; without a light source you can see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , any scene that should be ro@@ uted , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
open a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open a new model or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored on the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeated the last und@@ und@@ able command . this menu entry can only then select if you have manipul@@ ated the reverse .
saves the current window system and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
&quot; in this menu you will find Options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands with this option .
opens a dialog to set tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands and remove commands .
&quot; a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to use rough surfaces without any bending on the surface , without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a text texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color to pixel base using a picture file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application features a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can click with the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key return key .
&quot; you can set each image in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a particular file , simply type the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field is in the right lower corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialogue set - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other , short@@ cuts for the display window and short@@ cuts for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be set for each window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can continue down below . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you choose the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
&quot; with this option , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when entering the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if window mode is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; to set up only some of the file types that the program can also be displayed .
&quot; with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; the time span between image changes in a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sliders and the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until they are ab@@ orted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sliders and the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
change the keyboard short@@ cut to the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the map file short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduced the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
enlarged the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed when no browser window is opened .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; images . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; project .
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo , is a fast image gallery with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes . &quot;
&quot; as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user its part contributes to , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using this , your browser opens a page to reports of problems and wishes . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers will help each other . if you are a frequent user from &amp; show@@ foto , we would like to ask you to answer any other user from &amp; show@@ foto . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; try to set up as much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; in order to access these settings , you need to set the selection dialog in eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the symbols on the left . &quot;
&quot; in the exposure indicator indicator , you can select the colour that will be displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions on the selected pictures . you can view them in which you click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&amp; channel ; is an application to scan images that are no longer capable of scanning and storing images .
&quot; &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer makes images to scan , and save images immediately in a given folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving it . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner on SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this page : http : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; channel ; with the command channel Ch@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner .

&quot; to select an image , the user can only start a preview function and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to better choose the image , the user can zoom into the image and zo@@ oming out of the current selection . &quot;
&quot; if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? en leads to a break and you return to the main window . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the button settings , the same dialog box opens before the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if the user is not desired , the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way &amp; channel ; images can save . dialog to save for each image opens the dialog before any sc@@ anned image . if &amp; channel ; it automatically opens the dialog before any sc@@ anned image , then you need to select a file name in a previously defined folder . &quot;
the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
&quot; this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the images automatically to save images and is additionally the proposed name for the image in dialog to save . the automatically saved image is displayed a num@@ eric view@@ ix of each time , when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality to store . this value also changes the compression value when selecting the image quality , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; channel ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; channel ; . the button settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; channel .

you may need to set existing multimedia buttons so that they are as &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ short commands work . this makes your keyboard go to &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ control centre .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that mostly can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list
Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script can &apos;t be executed because of a missing dependency . please check in your script if all required modules are available , and use the dialog so that the user is not running a script . &quot;
&quot; if you use CSS in your document , you can check it using the W3@@ C CSS Vali@@ dation Service . ↑ Top Home &#124; About ... &#124; News &#124; Doc@@ s &#124; Help &amp; FAQ &#124; Feedback &#124; &quot;
you can quickly find that writing scripts are relatively simple .
&quot; using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the D@@ CO@@ P command , which every K@@ DE installation should be enclosed . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages enable exec@@ uting external programs and commands . usually , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . in this way , D@@ CO@@ P can be called relatively simple . here , an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; send noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script should also ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the setup dialog . in order to store and store the setup data , each script has to take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok uses the work@@ folder to the folder where all data should be saved . &quot;
track@@ Change Sign@@ als that a new piece is played .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
&quot; in order to add an entry back , you can use D@@ CO@@ P am@@ aro@@ k script add@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; ending , or when the user stops a script , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed in order to do instance the saving of data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ t@@ ar ) , which can also be used with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to load modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file per@@ missions : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can hang it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org , and hang the link to the Wiki scripts page of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; hang up for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps , you should use the category am@@ aro@@ k ; script . &quot;

&quot; with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you can simply move music into the play@@ list instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps searching for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &quot; s collection browser and quick search , you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have already some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ list browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard to choose , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically choose the correct music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , you have to enter the following list in the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;

&quot; save play@@ list when saving , stores the current play@@ list automatically when loading &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list when you exit . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of the play@@ list , otherwise the absolute position of the music files will be saved . &quot;
&quot; in order to display current pieces of change , the play@@ list window opens / down to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing the context browser , automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the App@@ ear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the section is part of three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the fonts section , you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you can select fonts for the following fields : play@@ list window , player window and context browser . press the fonts for the following fields : select play@@ list window , player window and context browser . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of user @-@ defined color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector for front and background color . &quot;
playback at the start causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; after the program start the playback automatically continues with the piece at the place where it was stopped at last finish .
&quot; if On @-@ Screen Display , a preview of the O@@ SD is shown and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font .
&quot; you can use your own colors to customize the O@@ SD colours for font and background . a click on the colour area opens the dialog to the color selection . if your own colors are not enabled , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used . &quot;
the Text text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users .
the card card Audio Output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers activate additional settings in this card card .
the card card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to browse a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . &quot;
search sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .

&quot; Amar@@ ok only requires the parcel of k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you must have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; needs some of them to compile modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will create difficulties for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ lib library for days . you can view the file by pressing in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again . &quot;
mostly this is that Tag@@ lib will be reading the meta information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ lib @-@ Developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a little more mature . &quot;
&quot; ensure that all libraries have compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ lib is compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the meta information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable . turn off when in@@ active for ... into the setting of the sound system , or do not use at least a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace email ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically in a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash , and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be corrected . &quot;
&quot; this is because many program data can write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into meta information , but not as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ day = $ mp@@ 3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag and amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PAN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynamic play@@ list ) see in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any colored Q@@ t Version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok first finds the correct version first . &quot;
there are some ways . most installation problems clarify the easiest way through the help of a experts your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also find help in other users or for developers . use the forum and the IRC channel at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in channel # am@@ aro@@ k .
bug@@ zilla is not suitable to search for help . please do not wear an error if you are at the location of an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
&quot; after the start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , only an empty play@@ list appears . how do music pieces come in ? &quot;
this is simple . use the file browser on the left @-@ hand side and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the Start window has been converted into the statistic window . you can find it under Tools statistics . &quot;
&quot; the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are subject to the evaluation by the user , while the points are automatically calculated . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate the pieces , you need to display the evaluation column in the play@@ list . click on the title bar of the play@@ list and select column . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and press de@@ f on your keyboard . or click on the right mouse button to select and select from play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu .
&quot; drag a play@@ list file with the mouse in the play@@ list and let them fall there , exactly as you would like it with other files . so simple is that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , right next to the addition button , the button play@@ list will be saved . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably missing you program x@@ mms @-@ de@@ vel . install the x@@ mms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very beautiful visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Tools E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question must be : which media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? &quot;
&quot; the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input et@@ a@@ ste &quot;
start the Y@@ a@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ sink , the device needs to provide a mixer . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and time @-@ like audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you to search for the problem , and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may have to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; this does &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must be de@@ coded first . one can &apos;t simply send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ Server with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ ory ) and increase the size of sound buff@@ ers ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs , which can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fication of the sound buff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ aso@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts Driver , but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts Driver . use another driver ( x@@ ine driver has been strongly recommended for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . yes , this is a fault , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; from . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in IRC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - store ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . &quot;

&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , that is already possible . set up an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm this command : D@@ CO@@ P am@@ aro@@ k player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; start playing . make sure that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;ll wake up from the soft tones of music you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to find the current in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; running titles if you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpretation and title of the current unit : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP D@@ CO@@ P --@@ user name am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ playing &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
&quot; the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; windows can be separated . click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size of variable windows . &quot;
the combination of Str@@ g + right mouse button provides a piece in the cli@@ ck@@ line sequence in the queue . by pressing the input list after a search in the play@@ list the first photo will be played and the search returned .
&quot; OK , the player window and the play@@ list have tricky functions , but how does it look with the symbol in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HOME is on a NFS drive .
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; doesn &apos;t work with NFS . either you have to left ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; for automatic code , use files from folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; &quot; W@@ HERE url = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ string ( url ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically this is the previous review with a dimin@@ ished value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can register the review for a piece of your own by clicking on a column over@@ writing in the play@@ list window . then you can change the review of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking on the right mouse button on the piece and click Edit : rating or F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review as well as edit met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the developers don &apos;t want you to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publication plan that will not bring together with the short @-@ term attached plan of Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , but some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the icon when playing animations in general settings . &quot;
the analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select tool@@ bars and set the desired changes .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install this then under Amar@@ ok ... App@@ ear@@ ance Cont@@ ext Browser design , click New Design ... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or Navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; while browsing the Kon@@ quer@@ or , start the quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click the Settings ( the top ) and select Delete am@@ aro@@ k in the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;

&quot; the context browser displays various information regarding the current unit . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context Browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you may notice that the sub@@ windows start away . the information presented here are now available in other parts of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; furthermore , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( ex@@ tras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window shows information about the piece . in the title it is the name of the piece , interpre@@ ter and the album . &quot;
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . you see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its assessment .
&quot; in order to display covers images in the context browser , the cover pictures are supported in the same folder as the current piece . the pictures may display any names , but images with the word front in the name are preferred . the context browser will also display covers that are either downloaded or downloaded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Recommended items , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpre@@ ter . this area shows the five most highly rated pieces of the current interpre@@ ter .
you can adjust which information to be displayed in the music window . click on the right mouse button somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .

you can click on all the pieces in the single fields to immediately start playing . you can also click on the right mouse button and select one of the options for adding the piece or album to play@@ list .
&quot; in the sub@@ menu text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download the text from the internet . once you click on the text window , try &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to download the text for the piece from the internet . if not yet no text script is running , you can choose which is to be started . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the text text . the changed version is then stored in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database .

&quot; if you are searching by spaces separated by empty search terms , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; search for entries containing all search terms . if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries , one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example all pieces are found , one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that Mike Old@@ field included , but not by entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller search . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece which does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ some search for pieces that are not included . &quot;
&quot; you can combine these syntax variants to match one another . example : Mike Old@@ field OR Review : &gt; 50 -@@ patch : bad . this search for all pieces that include Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and not included the comment . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the order sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key pressed , and then click the right mouse button in the desired order . the entries will then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are reproduced . &quot;
the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list is located at the bottom of the window .
&quot; next , the buttons are revers@@ ed and restored . so you can reverse or restore changes to the play@@ list . &quot;

&quot; the header is a nar@@ rower field that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . so you can set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator privileges are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard . &quot;
&quot; opens the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all the functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is for person@@ alizing and for fine adjustment of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; in order to use the D@@ CO@@ P ; you can either use the D@@ CO@@ P command line program , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are iden@@ tically identical , so it is rather your taste and the type of your task is critical to which the included programs you provide . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the D@@ CO@@ P command line program to use the D@@ CO@@ P command line . &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have common all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program have common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts which are described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void form@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void form@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void form@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d image ( URL url ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL url )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ folder ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String name ) void ad@@ dur@@ l ( K@@ URL url , Q@@ String term ) void _ item ( Q@@ String path ) void set@@ Volume e@@ ID ( Q@@ String path ) void set@@ Volume e@@ ID ( Q@@ String object ) void set@@ Volume e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( D@@ CO@@ P k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) D@@ CO@@ P $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ folder bar / fo@@ o D@@ CO@@ P $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ folder bar / fo@@ o D@@ CO@@ P $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T ad@@ dur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , easy audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . also other formats are available , depending on en@@ coder that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard drive ) and from many co@@ ders that use these WAV files ( if they have been installed ) . more co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ sl@@ ess and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually a per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as the los@@ sl@@ ess FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ Vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ di@@ ators have to be installed . &quot;
&quot; which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about coding , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying from protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , used &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; it is not possible to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; but if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device is not possible , it is not possible to read any audio CD ; even not the mechanisms of copying protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called as often called up until a suitable configuration ) , then the daily usage for reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you will frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats , depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is done manually . &quot;
this is just a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example you will find more information about how this program will be used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program .
&quot; starts the C@@ DD@@ B request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case first the connection to the internet will first need to be connected to the Internet . ) &quot;
start reading and - when en@@ coder is configured in the code tab in the Setup window - encoding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of en@@ coder , so that the selection with another en@@ coder can be read as the default . it is important to note that previously the en@@ coder has been configured in the Settings dialog in the Setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already selected file is selected to code instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
&quot; open the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ p@@ ses ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; open the main Setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with various card boards ( such as en@@ coder , for setting up the en@@ co@@ ders ) , you must go before the program can successfully be used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes audio quality , co@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right coding . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are other such as &apos; Sh@@ anks &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but the differences are less important because both co@@ ders are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ &apos;t be &apos; free , l@@ ame is provided free of charge with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license issues &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ ers is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music can also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame &apos; help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without consideration to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that can be entered manually or by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b on the internet , are available as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the encoding programs explain the switch for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3s is en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt from l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator must be added . the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button title in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which people can download the audio CDs that can download the information , so that all the other information can be downloaded instead of text : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music company can harm you . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is active a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address will not be used by the server ( This can only be the program@@ mer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographic will be used on the next mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the computers . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or downloaded ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; anyone who wants to know more detail , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see To note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed first if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to save the selected WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ ver and thus the file format can be selected . in the first opening are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab card to set up the encoding . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the co@@ di@@ ver can be used . this is also necessary for pre@@ defined codes . more information about co@@ di@@ ers are in Chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installation of a encoding , more information can be obtained through the input of a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the write and readers , and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio encoding of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fl@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , all understood , are still still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 ( tags ) .
&quot; it must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example using a search engine , since it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it ) .
&quot; the first section deals the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , something that is supposed to be done once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; , which must be repeated for any output &amp; CD ; &quot;
here we determine the encoding of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it at any reading a &amp; CD ; change once the matching settings are found . &quot;
the description of the device is handed over to the reading program so that the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your disk . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card @-@ card general settings . here is not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is shown / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; if you have any queries , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 444 . or contact us per email . if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; with the Internet so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , starts immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; it &apos;s associated with a low risk , if you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame is changed . the directory and fil@@ en@@ ame will be changed with quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with Ki@@ d@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to enter anything manually , then disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used . &quot;
&quot; C@@ DD@@ B is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for data query , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; C@@ DD@@ B Server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equal to the server , as many fire@@ walls bo@@ ast the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transfer data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should be de@@ activated . &quot;
simply take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; the number of selected pieces : excuse , is there a reason why more than one of the drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know it , so simply try . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to out the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you want to cross this , / must be set the path / folder in which the files will be saved in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to make some files with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; all this as it is on the screen shot . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances it must be bl@@ ended to see everything . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the compression factor is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
&quot; note the entry of &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags , in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) . &quot;
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of WAV files simultaneously : at a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can code more than a WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is , we just have the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; it is finished . this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard drive , we will create MP3 files . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD , which is not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots do not see a little different than the data collected for a &amp; CD ; with success of fre@@ ed@@ b , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually enter instead of picking them from the internet . comments are indicated on the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of this hand@@ book .
&quot; if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen@@ shot . only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , then look for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD could be picked up successfully from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be shown . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window , and you can select the database entry that your opinion is best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , you will need access to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD , according to the pattern on the next screen@@ shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist must not be entered in the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
the picture may not be used without the permission of the photographer .
&quot; attention : after successful retrieval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it contains the data like in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words with big letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the files created at any time with the tag editor . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
Tags are not supported by all encoding or file formats .
&quot; simply select one entry , which obviously coinci@@ des with the style of the selected CD . in this example , this is not important because we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ ap for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the current item . the title of the piece is in any case and other information you would like .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list .
&quot; note that it has a check @-@ character before each row of a piece . only the titles are selected are selected . a simple click on the line automatically switches the selection of the piece , or press the button All items selected on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button selection of reading the reading process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and track what is running . &quot;
&quot; click on orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window for checking the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
&quot; this error message will see if you try to work with a Ko@@ di@@ ver , which you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the job list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 format . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing can be configur@@ able is the result un@@ clear . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have any problem at simultaneous reading and coding ( of however , two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is codi@@ fied and a third order is in the queue of the encoding . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audiovisual ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x and 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the co@@ di@@ ver of your choice . &quot;
&quot; most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you have probably already done it ... &quot;
this section is aimed at individuals who compiled source files and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls you many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the various cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the initial start of the program , without any indication as it is going to go away from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; if you are reading this , probably already started the program . it should look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author does not maintain this manual . it is considered the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator . it is considered the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator . it is considered the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator . it is only after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has to leave this section and therefore agree with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others he has a real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ ao@@ ke @-@ real @-@ time ther@@ ing of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound projector , which is supported for G@@ US cards . &quot;

drag &amp; Drop so that you are in &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows to K@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
&quot; if you stop &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , K@@ mid will start again with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
first you can open ... from the menu file . it appears to select the usual file dialog with which you can choose the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows will fall . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button playing in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the empty button . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces , they will be added to a collection and then played one another . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece is played , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive and drive . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too quickly or too slowly , you can click on the arrows on the left and on the right of the Tem@@ po@@ inter . to get the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the empty button appears like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry break in the menu , inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in a musical piece . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type will automatically determine which a song is used , so you will automatically select the kar@@ ao@@ ke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a type of event type , select the items of text or song events from the menu item . the same function also features the 1 and 2 keys . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summari@@ ze . these will be played in the series . in this section you will find how you can use collections efficiently .
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find the collection below the item ... Click on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than a collection , you can set the be@@ ers in the collection manager . &quot;
in the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . remember that when you add a lot of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece of opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) will be automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when Autom@@ atically add to the collection is not enabled when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and click Remove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you choose the series after the sub@@ menu of the menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the sequence as they have been added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add or delete songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ ao@@ ke text . &quot;
&quot; to further jump a song , choose the next song next song , next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to step back a song back , select the preceding piece , the entry preceding piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the Delete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not play a role as they are not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ izer , which are not general @-@ MIDI . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map general MIDI events are translated into events that understand the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you just have a sound card , you do not need any MIDI map , because all Sound@@ cards GM @-@ compatible ( including A@@ WE and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you must edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required conversion to play a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section which may appear as often as desired . &quot;
define PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that DE@@ F@@ INE is used to show that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so that I can offer future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not general MIDI compatible .
&quot; in this section , you can see how the patches of General MIDI can be depicted on your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign will be ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that need this instrument to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard , for example , take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; if you want to play a MIDI file a touch with Patch 127 ( rifle shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and play the tone 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that this patch is meant here with the term drum @-@ patch of the patch , where each sound represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one that means the sound level of the ever same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to indicate how sounds can be depicted on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; like the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as its existence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use several key@@ maps only in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to form sounds on the percussion channel . see for example the key@@ maps included .
&quot; this section can be used to link some channels to others . if you want to replace the first and second channel , you can easily change the CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will be used with the name name for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will be used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the Per@@ c@@ ussions @-@ Channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio can be multip@@ lied in which ratio of Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events will be multip@@ lied by the value n , this is converted into the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only forwar@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used because GM is a keyboard that will play a pitch of pitch with the value of 40@@ 96 , to play a tone higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards are to be played by two tones up to one oc@@ ta@@ ve . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a little bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you can see which sounds are played straight .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . if you have changed an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t shine more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has two different views to display the played notes . view the View menu in the Settings section below the point channel view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD displays the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . if so , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down it . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , etc . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file requires 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution . &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; in advance , activate automatic addition to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . to restore the standard tempo , you can double click on the LCD . &quot;
&quot; I have a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ work area a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a kar@@ ao@@ ke file ) , or I &apos;d like to play a file , only change in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn the setting automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so , set the setting automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly that a MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ate me , continue to &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ das ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ das ; laga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I &apos;m not trying to take a lot of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files , music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ ao@@ ke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; to send me a postcard from your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ ao@@ ke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I &apos;ll send you a postcard or a MIDI file , but you should contact me as I already have the file . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and don &apos;t get money for money . I want to emphasize that I only get more program@@ mi@@ ere , because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or an A@@ WE card .
&quot; if you do not have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter , it runs as if you have a sound card except that you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;

&quot; the program is used for playing video files from M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to bookmark the preferred links below the menu book@@ marks , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category of permanent play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hier@@ archy . if you take an entry , his group and all his sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and start playing with the attached entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current &apos; , television and permanent play@@ list can also be modified by direct editing of XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this when &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to choose from the same with play@@ list from the menu and select either the Edit mode or choose another category . &quot;
all changes are lost when the Edit Mode left or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
&quot; due to the ease of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 , if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ xml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ xml . the format needs to be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at the start doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically finished by opening another source . however , this would be distur@@ bing at the end animation , the user can end the application for a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; t ; t ; t ; t ; t ; &amp; lt ; t ; &amp; lt ; in the source package of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; in the source package of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; are in the directory testing / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L , supported by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &quot;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; . here you can set the path from the player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player .
&quot; there is no tab for this play@@ list in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , such as a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ zilla module : &quot;
Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even be played the special field video for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
&quot; to play the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &quot; flash &quot; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player must be specified as service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the Setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be used in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the Browser Module library . if no errors occur , the back@@ end issue within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , a given back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual modi@@ fying the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play TV cards either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be used , the scanner can be used to use the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Records ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port should be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contains a dv@@ b therein . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also just the same for the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , it must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) &quot;
&quot; internal are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , url@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ resource . &quot;
is there any evidence of how to qui@@ d my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root to boot the device . it is absolutely sure that / dev / c@@ drom appears on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine starts only slowly but why must my CPU be checked on their performance every time ?
&quot; note : the answer is outdated . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time will check x@@ ine the CPU . &quot;
&quot; you might want to change the Directory as well if you need to have your uploaded images placed in e.g. &quot; &quot; www / gallery / &quot; . &quot; &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; K@@ ile .
Lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be taken back to the pack@@ et &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution and installation CD ; / DVD will be used . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages from &amp; K@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation should be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; if you have any queries , or if extensions are required , this should be addressed on the mailing list K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ working area . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers the opportunity to use all &amp; latex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within these a simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; latex ; -@@ programs . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; kate ; and its possibilities to learn the manual for Kate should be used . users of &amp; K@@ ile , can start working directly with the reading of the chapter works with the editor of &amp; works ; begin . &quot;

all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ divided element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; latex ; -@@ files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; latex files . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; ger@@ Ã ¤ te@@ achable file ) &#93; , &amp; K@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source text . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as the font and is in addition to PDF the external output ear@@ t of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , conversion and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;

you can specify it in the FTP Folder field on the Publish window . the FTP port is normally located on port 21 thus this has been pre@@ filled for you already . if your web site uses another port , you will have to enter it here . &quot;
2 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and defines the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
&quot; the brackets according to the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; determines the size of the font . if the size doesn &apos;t set it at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code example has to be entered , the &amp; latex ; source text has to be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to do this is the use of the Men@@ Ã ¼ r Build or Kn@@ op@@ fs . &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; K@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
&quot; if the compilation of the document fails , should be searched in the logging after the errors . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; for example , a report with the font size is 12 and only a few of the columns should have a different font size . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ D and \ \ end { environment } can be created within the surrounding area . &quot;

&quot; there are many opportunities to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , grease pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands can either end up with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
&quot; \ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive print and is closed as long as it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } . &quot;
\ \ quot@@ a : create a quot@@ ation in the document . the quot@@ ation begins with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
&quot; after the background to write the source text with the &amp; latex ; label language , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; once in the wizard a little text has been entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be done . a quote , a few places in fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , the editor can be returned to the editor using editor view or Str@@ g e ( in the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try out and fun . &quot;
&quot; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer , there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; latex ; source text has been created , the conversion can begin using the button in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
the mouse po@@ inter has to be positioned in a line of the source text and can be cli@@ cked on the preview window . the jump to the corresponding spot in the DVI ; viewer is then done .
&quot; with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document of &amp; K@@ ile ; open and to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; K@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as a text editor ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor ) &quot;
&quot; if an error is available , if an error is available , this is displayed in the logging file or in the message window . &quot;
the log file is always the source code in the source code . the log file is always the line where the error appears . in order to view the error message it must be cli@@ cked to the error in the logging and &amp; K@@ ile ; jumps to the wrong line .
&quot; as soon as you cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting empty document , document can either be written by the reason or the wizard can be used for a quick creation of a new document . additional information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; most users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be stored in &amp; K@@ ile , created , saved and loaded to ease the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file can be opened or created a new file . &amp; K@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and select a file template . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using a file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or drawing encoding ) . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is used by entering into document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the instructions in the editor . once the document was created in this way the following steps were executed :
&quot; when creating a new document , the own template can then be balanced instead of the default income . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; -@@ files are created . a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below . &quot;

this command is spra@@ yed at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the command to be placed in the area .
the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to be connected to the environment .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is in front of or inside the command \ \ begin { environment } , the end of the environment will be spra@@ yed ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; with the input of many screw@@ ed ambient commands , you can quickly get lost . this command removes the last modified environment , so that the modified environment structure will not be cr@@ ushed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; -@@ groups , which are determined by cl@@ amps { ... } . &quot;

this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the scre@@ ened clasp .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the cur@@ sed clamp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , becomes the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . by editing the command line interface , you create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . these command line interface supplies signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; for random signatures , any signature from the signature can be read from &amp; k@@ sig . through many signatures with different quotations , styles and information you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for every day , you will use the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . for each day you use different signatures , as with the random signatures create unique e @-@ mails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many signatures as you wish . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there is always sufficient signatures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then click on the menu file , or click on the icon with the red cross removing the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; you can select short commands for menu entries . in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . click on the user defined and enter the new cur@@ sor by pressing the button or key combination . &quot;
&quot; for the use of &amp; k@@ sig ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can paste the signature text from the output of a command . &quot;
&quot; all call stack elements are listed here . the older the stack entry is , the lower is its frame number . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on a call stack in the shown list , the cur@@ sor will be placed in the main window to the corresponding line number of the corresponding file . &quot;

output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time when mein@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is a great graphical interface for this . &quot;
&quot; if the currently opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is then simply select the current work folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book can be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on screen , your file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported error and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already checked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then you can easily check up the current file . if not , delete it in the current file , and select the file selection by means of a file selection . &quot;

&quot; the plugins that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , la@@ yed , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even maybe little to do . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we start with the menu plugin . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all the included plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element is :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plugins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to find the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project more people working in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for clear identification .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub@@ project leaders . &quot;
&quot; the user can search for yourself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list , and the button gri@@ ds . the currently selected member ( their ID ) will be bold after you are : text . &quot;
nick@@ name and setting of their own identity are important in terms of news and notes . see for more information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something happens . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event promotions are actions that will be executed when something particular happens in the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project so that later , how much someone has worked on , or sending a message when a file is secured , or a script that will add a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an e @-@ mail will be sent to the address selected in the recipient list . the address can be a team or sub@@ project manager . see how this ladder can be set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
it can either be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ otation keyword in a commentary volume followed by ann@@ otation text .
&quot; in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , with the nick@@ name of the team member , is a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project manager After the area and sub@@ project managers should be given the corresponding area or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ atting languages , the D@@ TD agnos@@ tic and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up by means of Settings Qu@@ anta ... this dialog extends over some pages which will be dealt with each other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; large / Small revision of tags : large / un@@ ambig@@ uous tags are automatically added tags . normal big / small spelling means , the tags are inserted as described in the tag@@ xml files . &quot;
&quot; in large / minor spelling of attributes : large / small spelling of automatically added attributes . normal big / small spelling means , the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ xml files . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; not optional Tags automatically , as above all other tags with the exception of simple tags . &quot;
&quot; automatically updating the start and end day : when on , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic recognition of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding encoding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or in other way as with file open opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be passed ) . this setting is being loaded from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not detected . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regularly backup copies , so that in case of a power failure or crash when the next start of the program can be restored the document from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or a separate view ( or documentation in a cart@@ on ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and the source code simultaneously . &quot;
set the window settings to the default next start is useful when the user interface has changed by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depend on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ etting layout command line parameters .
warning messages -@@ range is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no longer in@@ quire .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which depic@@ ts the figure of the par@@ ser knot in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
empty no@@ des are empty spaces in the text while empty groups are not found in the current document .
&quot; the range for setting up ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which can be un@@ folded while editing a comprehensive text . Ab@@ brevi@@ ations are available in groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means that there may be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ y@@ ab@@ brevi@@ ation is something different than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plugins are K@@ Part applications of third page that can be used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , at the best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following will be given : &quot;
address : the path to plug @-@ in if it is not at a standard location as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information will be passed to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese mode &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug is denied . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts does not refuse loading when this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , if the given information is correct . pick @-@ up allows saving the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bug@@ ging was completely re @-@ developed . the support for the non @-@ built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bug@@ ger was set , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bug@@ ger plugin concept was implemented which allows different implementations of plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only a plugin is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bug@@ ger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bug@@ ger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection box the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; if a de@@ bug@@ ger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of monitored variables appear . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view , in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bug@@ ger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bug@@ ger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action will create the connection to de@@ bug@@ ger , if necessary , or it shares the plugin to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action will be triggered by default when a project is opened , which must not be taken care of . &quot;
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session star@@ te the session . closes the connection to de@@ bug@@ ger or termin@@ ates the sounds according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to run a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bug@@ ger output .
&quot; shows the de@@ bug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script and continuously sending information about the monitored variables , as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is done , the execution starts . if it happens before a de@@ bug@@ ging requirement starts , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; shows the de@@ bug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script , without information on monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script has been given , the execution starts as soon as a request is placed . &quot;
the de@@ bug@@ ger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script without entering the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bug@@ ger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script , whereby if possible in functions and include errors . &quot;
shows the de@@ bug@@ ger to move the statement and go to the next so if there would be the current one .
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be monitored , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
this dialog can be entered a variable or set a new value of a variable .
&quot; you might want to change the Directory as well if you need to have your uploaded images placed in e.g. &quot; &quot; www / gallery / &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this chapter describes how to customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to adapt to your needs and how you can &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to become better .
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting Packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , used to provide support for marker and script languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; s . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folder contains two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folder contains two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tool@@ bar . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ di@@ alog@@ es , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars make a quick insertion of tags into a document without any danger of a writing error . &quot;
&quot; tag folder are nothing as a folder . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder wear the name of descri@@ p@@ tive language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4@@ .01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declar@@ es whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is laid in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but only does not contain anything else . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; a argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the class class class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an element type element .
this element can only be used for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . additionally it contains further tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed and etc ; This is a only element type element .
returns the source code for the attributes used in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P . the D@@ CO@@ P interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to reach the source data .
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P and the name of an interface . the D@@ CO@@ P method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = D@@ CO@@ P , an interface and a method name . the arguments that are passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , meaning the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container day is group@@ ed together with the elements of a list . it is only possible for attribute description only once . it is an element type element .
sets the position of a tag within a dialog . this day can occur only once ( for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialog . this day should be present for each field in dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the tags . this element is an element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is an element type .
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; empty spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog is at the top of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ windows to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , check only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in the following , an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; in the following , an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , re@@ achable via D@@ TD &apos;s Bear@@ bei@@ te D@@ TD settings ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be prepared for a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&quot; &#91; general &#93; Version = Ver@@ tig@@ 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD @-@ specification . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4@@ .01 Transitional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name . &quot;
an action can set up actions with Settings ... click New Action to the same dialog :
&quot; the keyboard short@@ cut is assigned to this action . clicking the user defined button can be assigned a button short@@ cut ; with K@@ one , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
&quot; the simpl@@ est actions . it can be entered in the Det@@ ection settings and when performing the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : sh / home / my@@ home / my@@ nam@@ .@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % script@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % script@@ dir / my@@ script@@ .@@ sh@@ .@@ This way tries &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / JavaScript in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / JavaScript in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / JavaScript in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / JavaScript in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / JavaScript in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / JavaScript in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / JavaScript in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / JavaScript in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / JavaScript in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / JavaScript in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / JavaScript in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / JavaScript in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / JavaScript in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / JavaScript in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / JavaScript in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / JavaScript in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the text will be added to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , which is used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameter for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the afor@@ emen@@ tioned methods , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can accept input from the default input . in the input field , you can specify what to send to the default input . options are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only sensible with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts the Edit mode .
fill out all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the day attributes has attributes and you are planning , enable &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; when available , so you can enter the action when using the action . &quot;
who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; quot ; , graphic Show other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol not only helps you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day is start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm OK . &quot;
&quot; press the button , and continue with other tags , so there is still what is , or confirm with OK to finish . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to supplement some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for tool@@ bar or it should be shared to a better overview through some tren@@ ches in multiple groups . make sure that the tool@@ bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to add a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the Tren@@ ner does not know the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by sampling of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; save in the correct folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be placed in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most popular extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user , the possibility to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or form@@ atting language that you like to like . this is why this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for form@@ atting / script / etc . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
the tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example you can see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation as something :
this forum is moder@@ ated beforehand : your contribution will only appear after being vali@@ dated by a site administrator .
note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference . this shows that it is about sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents of the directory are refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the top end of the building view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources files will be replaced . &quot;
&quot; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts the documentation for the my@@ sql _ fetch _ array function will be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file associations . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now you can save your file doc@@ r@@ c , though , after $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( such as you have specified this in your file doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these good and well worth are shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to divide the separ@@ ating resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else who are sent . in various places there is an email sending menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email sending tool bar with an email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus users can download them . &quot;
&quot; when uploading your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private g@@ pg key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys you can select one . &quot;
&quot; upload the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before the installation , investigate &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signatures . in case of problems it war@@ ns and it can be canc@@ eled correctly . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message will appear with the specification of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML language , currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it will be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of day files may be required in tag@@ xml format . there is the simpler way to convert a D@@ TD to a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD file menu and converting a D@@ TD file . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which should be used . then the following dialog appears :
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction is concerned with a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; using , available . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user .
&quot; the project @-@ related elements are only available within a certain project . this can be done from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool bars with special promotions specifically for the files of a particular project . simple , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which makes the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editing window , the construction views , the boxes with information and the tool@@ bar . please note , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all cart@@ on , re@@ load , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editing pane will lead to another context menu with regard to the edited document contents , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the word under the mouse po@@ inter or opening the file when the string is described under the mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4@@ .01 Transitional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of the further enlargement of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bar will be adapted to the new functions and thus associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if it is a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; p@@ ushes ; in your document , then click the icon that represents the day . now you can enter the data for this just added tag . if you want to insert the data for this just added tag , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to navigate to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to navigate , open it and through strips . in the presentation with card conductors are available for files , project , templates , documentation structure , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , providing . this view shows all files in the project and allows the managing of files in the project using a right mouse click . actions like adding , removal , uploading or delete the files from the storage medium can be done using the context menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website , etc . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on how they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the corresponding user and templates in projects . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , you can display the internal structure of the active document . by clicking an element the cur@@ sor will be placed in the document to the position of the element . by right clicking of an element , a list of commands will open to the navigation and refre@@ sher of the tree . &quot;
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it it can change attributes and nam@@ espace . the application @-@ oriented application system enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
&quot; here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and edited . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two boxes at the bottom of the window , which can be reached by means of usable information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
this card lets you find information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . for example the D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to D@@ TD will be displayed .
this card trick shows all errors in the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed will give all error messages ( such that there is ) in this window .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and do not run here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path is the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H before its bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a multitude of powerful features .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developer of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus started working with a nearby idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ? well , this would be the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer on pure &amp; html ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this , the appropriate &amp; IDE ; &quot;
&quot; now , to the afor@@ emen@@ tioned claim that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follow , in good use of free software , the idea of Why development , what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; it allows users and developers to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development , and has been developed quickly to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is not connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers were allowed the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; for more details , please help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / qu@@ anta ) . &quot;

&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file , which is not on it , and the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section about templates . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project editor folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting the cli@@ pboard there are special characters for &amp; html , so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as form@@ atting instructions . &quot;
converts the text from the cli@@ pboard in &amp; URL ; -@@ description which the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s are used in the anchor tag .
this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages exist !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bug@@ ger .
the problem is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
shows the symbol column on the left from the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if it &apos;s book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with the entries preceding or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
open an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory to new files that might be there . that allows e.g. to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder , and add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO mode ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , projects you will find the details . &quot;
loads a project tool . these are stored in project You / Tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved using Settings actions , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you have not yet saved the tool@@ bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do this . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new mail message with the tool bar as attachment .
allows the uploading of tool@@ bars to the main server where each other can access it . see in .
download a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or someone else has made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / au@@ ric the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refre@@ shed without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global player is not present and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder will fail .
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags attached to the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day settings dialog if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activate the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . &quot;
&quot; in the plugins menu , the available plugins are listed below the menu items listed above . click on them . click on an activated plug @-@ in . &quot;
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on the works ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of line end identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot;
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; Instant change@@ over between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , the change@@ over is sometimes time consuming or incomplete graphics . recommended is the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open window . &quot;
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affects every application using the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser . &quot;
addresses the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; works ; you find details .
a dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar or add which can change the sequences .
&quot; this should create a help corresponding to the environment of the mouse po@@ inter , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , they will find the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled with the best from top to bottom , as for example after filling the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can later be set up with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project attributes can be set . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pro ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ y ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine on which you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ name e.@@ example ) or an IP address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) is possible . &quot;
&quot; if this field is empty , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adaptation may be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a shared collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . it can be selected several files or entire folders .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and modify . with ser@@ vers@@ ed script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be integrated , if a project is started from scratch . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of coup@@ on . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the check , out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be edited in the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or change the Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames can be ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to top , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
project view that will be loaded when opening the project . in case you can read more about project views .
this allows the de@@ bug@@ ger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed will be used . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button . in case the de@@ bug@@ ger is described .
&quot; Upload profiles can be uploaded to the profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a construction view for the contents of the server for each profile by pointing out their own structure view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the Unter@@ Window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration event configuration , one can switch event actions and add these actions , change or delete event actions when a previously certain event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced at the moment . &quot;
&quot; to open a different project , select project ... from the project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files will be found . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there you can manage files in the current project .
&quot; folder behavior is equally , however , the entries are missing and opening with ... in the right mouse button call@@ able context menu : &quot;
&quot; here , various profiles can be searched . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see . &quot;
&quot; if only a profile is present , the button will be low to prevent the removal . &quot;
the password is kept in the core memory and forget the program . this option is useful when frequent upload of files is required and the rather un@@ secure password on the disk does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before uploading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ load profiles can be uploaded to different servers for the project ( or parts of the project ) . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog displays : &quot;
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed Ki@@ o X3 . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP , , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed except the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your spru@@ e wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . &quot;
&quot; a project view is just one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be downloaded in a project , i.e. by simply di@@ pping the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be opened or deleted by the project tool@@ bar on the project or project tool@@ bar , which can be opened or deleted by the Tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this helps not only boost productivity but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to its own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , which is best suited to tool@@ bar tool@@ bars . use and addition distinguish themselves . the addition of tool@@ bars is handled down in the section of adding tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar and the icons can be set either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new tool@@ bar can be created , the tool@@ bar or tool@@ bar can be executed , which can be displayed in the dialog where the actions on this or other tool@@ bar should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action worked out which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with Settings tool@@ bars ... and set actions set ..
&quot; templates are made in the essential document skel@@ et@@ ons , code @-@ schn@@ apps and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; using templates basically like a standard file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or any other directory in the tree tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , in some of the limitations you can imagine for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use .
&quot; binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be included any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; binary . binary templates are usually inserted in documents by linking ( e.g. images with img src = / src / url ) . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created by any text document . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template , but the same text area will always be inserted into the documents . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for all websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed t@@ ar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure according to your ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As a template , save as a local template . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates . &quot;
select text in your document and click on file as a template to save selection as a local / project template .
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied into one folder folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as drag and drop or paste the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project file , select a name for the template and backup a name for the template , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can create head@@ lines , head@@ lines or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; you can create head@@ lines and head@@ lines . in addition , you can view some things when using templates in projects very deep in the eye . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; to set the behavior of a folder , click the right mouse button to select the folder and select the context menu properties . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default , and fits for everything except the regular folders in the template . if a root folder would be set so it would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you will probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
allows previous or displayed text for templates in this folder . this may be general head@@ lines or head@@ lines for all templates for a particular project and allows you to equi@@ p a whole presentation by copying content templates into a folder with a special header / foot@@ er .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( showing the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , replacing the source text editor using the V@@ PL ; editor and the second , the editor window replaces the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML , page and a cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document , the &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; source text . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly like the first one , except that the changes are visible both in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor , and the cur@@ sor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , and the cur@@ sor is active in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set up via Settings Qu@@ anta ... After selecting V@@ PL ; -@@ view , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast calcul@@ ator and a large gap for slow . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to choose the title of the website . this allows editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this allows the following to change the following : &quot;
meta tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . meta @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click to the list allows the change of contents such as keywords on the column name and keyword keywords key password 2 on the content column .
&quot; CSS rules are the new way of designing the view of pages in browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list , or delete a change over the list . &quot;
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file button and choose the corresponding file .
&quot; the use of the cur@@ sor is like in a word processing , due to paths with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves like usual . the marker works as usual . text can be inserted by inser@@ ting , and can be deleted by means of a button or remo@@ del@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the insertion of tags is made in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor . it is to note that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed from any other surrounding anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the lists wizard are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for checking style sheets . in contrast to other programs for style templates , the search for specific elements is possible and the style of style can be trac@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; to get &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successfully compiled , except &amp; k@@ de ; nor libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ xml , which are already existing in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g uses the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path name . fil@@ en@@ ame in the same folder like the upper@@ most loaded style template file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ sl@@ db@@ g is used for example a style file file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ sl , is the following input : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or total agreement with a default named QNAP or a specified model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template agrees with any QNAP NAS that contains the template template . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ espace at the given &quot; &quot; QNAP &quot; &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ espace specified in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ sl : test@@ 1 will be added to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;

&quot; several commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass compound words as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; &quot; as an argument , a stop in a file named &quot; &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; . &quot; &quot;

there are many graphical tools for comparing . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
&quot; the merger was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made a lot of changes and at the same time had changed much text at the same time . another program@@ mer had changed much text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps the ind@@ entation had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , any amount of other useful functions were added . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it into the cli@@ pboard and insert it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , almost into a complete file browser . &quot;
&quot; also 3 @-@ way merge will be fully supported . this is useful , if two people work independently of one piece of code and make changes . &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when folders merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and re@@ jects the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently check code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can easily copy the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; the FTP port is normally located on port 21 thus this has been pre@@ filled for you already . if your web site uses another port , you will have to enter it here . &quot;
&quot; the opening dialog allows the manual entry of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or the log of an recently opened file from the list . you don &apos;t have to specify the third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files will be done . &quot;
&quot; using the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the configuration or merge of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected , for B and C however , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when merge is crossed , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to immediately specify a output file . you can also get this step later when saving . &quot;
the set button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the Compare / Merg@@ ing .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from cli@@ pboard into the active comparison window . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; which idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar features . if you want to find out how similar to these functions , it would be a relatively large effort . you would have to create two appropriate files , insert them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and compare the relevant sections . &quot;
note : currently you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; just drag the drop down text into a comparison window .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and paste ( instead of copying and paste ) . in such case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window you find the Info line . the Info line of the source window contains the A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse a while over the line . then a small help window will show the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the colour green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) well . &quot;
&quot; when differences have been found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white signs are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the summary column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks is activated , the line is dotted with a broken line . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparative windows ) has also a Info line with the in@@ scription issue : , the file name and &#91; changes &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to next level dissolved / un@@ solved conflict to find the still remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparative windows are used , each difference is also a conflict of manually solved . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group will appear in all windows and the first line of the group will appear . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , by automatic merge or by manual editing , no further line is left in the group ; then it is displayed in these lines of text &amp; lt ; no line in the queue is displayed . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you might copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; drag @-@ down ; however appears in the cli@@ pboard , if you copy such text from the result panel . c@@ auti@@ ously with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if you ignore the options , ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates mainly with the image flow and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , down , side , side , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g end , Si@@ v as you are used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the window window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ writing mode . ( pres@@ et is the insert mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already mentioned in section merge and edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can navigate to the current / first / last difference , the next / previous difference ( Str@@ g @-@ pattern upward / tr@@ g @-@ upward ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ pattern upward ) or the next / last un@@ solved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking to cli@@ pboard , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g insert ) . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a line feed note \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use Wag@@ ram return + line feed \ \ r \ . k@@ diff@@ 3 does not retain the source of source files ; therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of last used files will be saved automatically when entering the next startup . ( menu setting - &gt; k@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose , you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences in cur@@ sor font are represented . if the selected font does not support this presentation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be ro@@ ast@@ ly represented . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the number of blank spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; when entering or return , the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection will automatically copy into the cli@@ pboard . copy the manually into the cli@@ pboard . &quot;
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly used option on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all fully identical lines can be found in source files . only during this first step , white signs are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a car return sign &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , other again only save a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in default this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs . &quot;
&quot; the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the results of the selection will appear before the next un@@ solved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( pre @-@ set is manual selection . ) This is useful if white signs are less important in many files . if you do this only from time to time , take advantage of the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . &quot;
these options are handled in chapter to scan folders and execute a merge . see for details under documentation for the directory comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ OR@@ IG . if such a backup file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ OR@@ IG , this will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is located globally via the control centre . )
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , all entries will be used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; the selection fields for encoding appears a short note , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a informal character for you . ) &quot;
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpret . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have processed a file , you can specify which encoding for saving is to be used . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ processor commands , you might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre@@ processor can handle only 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) . &quot;
&quot; this applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments are activated . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode all the differences in a color coded over@@ see column are displayed . but sometimes you might want to see the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ t ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ t ; C is displayed next to the normal or a second over@@ see column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen better for long lines . simply drop down the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files . up @-@ to @-@ date file merge in the merge menu works even if you are only using two files . ( if this function is used to restart the merge again , the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a normal pre@@ processor command has been specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is only used in line row . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds exactly to your needs . each input line must have an associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind is to allow users more flexibility when alig@@ ning the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed and most users do not want to program themselves . the good news is however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely sufficient . &quot;
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed experiments , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in k@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre@@ processing command for line equ@@ als . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 678@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every mark between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hits , and every hits will be replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several translations at once . then you can use the sem@@ icol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the translations from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; Aller@@ dings are different in per@@ l some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l requires only ( and ) without the pre@@ defined &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor is maintained for displaying and mer@@ ging . further operations change only the data which the line equ@@ als are equal to al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line equ@@ als the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes the text or hidden differences , you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively compare and merge . &quot;
... &quot; makes for each object a proposal to merge ; you can customize the proposal from the start , &quot;
... can simul@@ ate the mer@@ ging and shows the simulated changes without them really perform ;
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files very similar . you just need to open the folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as base . if no target folder was specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start merge , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will inform a small news window about current progress . if you cancel the folder , only the files are listed until then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is completed , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
each file and each folder that has been found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally folded together . you can click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the object double or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right .
&quot; if you double click on a file , the file comparison will be started and it appears in a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , a / B / C columns are used in the columns A / B / C the colours red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; in identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries varies . &quot;
&quot; folder will be considered identical , if you are identical . then folder will also have the same color . in folders , the age can also be used for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colours reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copying of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B is identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C should not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : errors : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such errors exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : errors : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such errors exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode to sync is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ised . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; direct after the merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders are merged and the option to select new file instead of merge ( uncertain ) is checked , then investigated &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and strikes the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. if such errors are not removed , the merge will not be started . &quot;
&quot; during the merge , a file will be processed after the other . the status column shows fer@@ ns if the merge is successful , and according to other messages if something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should check the final check and check if the status is ok . &quot;
&quot; this includes the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ itary , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for deleted conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged ) . &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries . if you have selected all of the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you don &apos;t have a destination folder , then the three folder merge mode C will be used as destination , when two @-@ folder merge will be used as the target and the sync will be used as destination and / or B . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries will be displayed in the folder structure , even in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unnecessary surprises : &quot;
&quot; in order to merge all entries , select directory routing / proceed in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to only perform the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if by contradic@@ tory file types still invalid merge actions exist , a message appears on the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options , simul@@ ate and break down . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are ready with a file , select again / or press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved , a corresponding dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to a fault , a message and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . &quot;
&quot; this entry was posted in English , International , International , Sea Control , Sea Control , Security Policy , Security Policy , Security Policy . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; k@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that fit on the given pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ icol@@ on ; a valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ icol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ OR@@ IG ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ icol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ OR@@ IG ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignore files that would be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ os@@ atically generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
&quot; for links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links will show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to folder : if the option is switched off , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . &quot;
&quot; the complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders over a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the modification date and the file size . however , this speed advantage costs you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is activated in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to the terms of the change date , there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal to the same size . this can be useful for example when copying the chan@@ ges@@ et . please use caution . this option is activated in default . &quot;
&quot; activate the synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merge will be saved in both folders . the results of merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , then the copying of the newer file will be proposed as action . ( this is considered uncertain , as it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be ren@@ amed and the extension .@@ original When an old backup file with the .@@ OR@@ IG extension already exists , this will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge entire folder . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally the folder merge mode remains visible to the merge of individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want that , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory and text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also merge a single file directly without having to run the folder together , and the file will not be merged once you run the folder together . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you read the directory again : directory menu : new entries &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slave . k@@ diff@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folders . some things should be aware of :
&quot; a path can be relative , or .. . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be differenti@@ ated if a link is shown on a file or folder . then , a file will always be accepted as a link . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions , or change the change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( note the option of confidenti@@ ality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently as a distinction viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start k@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have been modified since generation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the configuration of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or selection of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now there are compli@@ ments ) there are already . furthermore the name k@@ diff@@ 3 already shows that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 out of the Di@@ ff tool collection .
this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way or going to go .
&quot; in the default configure configure in / usr / local , K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information about this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is the case . this is the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor notes for each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and log of the button A / B / C . this important information is however lost , if the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to create your own file format that could save it . &quot;
the effort required for this was too big . you can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text should another editor should be used .
&quot; after removing the text , suddenly lt ; No src is left ; appeared and the text cannot be extingu@@ ished . what does this mean and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and lacks the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
&quot; in order to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use k@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir is the folder in your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have problems when comp@@ iling . should nevertheless occur , please tell the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut off ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift ) copies into the cli@@ pboard and delet@@ es the selected text . insert the text from the cli@@ pboard to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current mark .
&quot; only differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you need to re @-@ read the folder with the function Update . )
&quot; if the destination folder has not already contains these files , it will not be modified in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with lettering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed after clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . under@@ scores in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , to finish or move them . this works both within a working area and several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can view all virtual work@@ spaces , as well as the applications that are running in the applications . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , Windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if you cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when clicking on an application .
sends application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; this check box is marked , can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual work@@ spaces are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this field allows the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces are displayed . if it is displayed together with name , the names with folder numbers are provided , &amp; eg ; 1 working area . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each work@@ space is displayed as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed in order to enable their selection . &quot;
here is the view of the program window . simple rectang@@ les with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with their standard symbol and pixel map showing a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the main window will be determined : classical lets &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal and vertical position are positioned in a vertical row , which is very good for the presentation at the side of the work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , view the window as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs out of the control bar . &quot;
click the right mouse button inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and after selecting the switch ... lets the dialog settings appear .
&quot; at the moment , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can manually do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must register as user root login or register to your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package is k@@ de@@ base , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual disability . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; when you &amp; k@@ mag ; start , a window appears as above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . the image that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse po@@ inter as a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can display a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the environment of the mouse po@@ inter at the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; please note that the mouse po@@ inter is displayed in the enlarged window , please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse po@@ inter . this is always the default c@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ Mouse hands . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can change it with the arrow and mouse button and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse po@@ inter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can catch the content of the magni@@ fying window and move . this goes also with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the &amp; Shift key , press or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can shift the window . &quot;
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the window is stuck and only the lower right corner is moved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer to copy into a file , to paste it into the cli@@ pboard ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more . &quot;
start or stops the update of the display . the stop of the update causes the CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area will be displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; use automatically your set short@@ cuts to store files , open a new window , printing , new@@ line ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fication and size etc . &quot;
&quot; it may also be known as &amp; k@@ deli@@ fier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use a magni@@ fying glass to enlarge the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of benefit : from research or artist to the web designer or visual handic@@ apped . &quot;

it is intended to help people suffering from the RS@@ I Syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which each mou@@ sec@@ lick pain prepar@@ es .
it is intended to help people suffering from the re@@ eti@@ tive tract in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome .
&quot; if you suffer pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; in order to make it even clear@@ er : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , avoid pain caused by moving the mouse , it is against pain caused by moving the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic auxiliary devices , the result can fall for each different . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movement and takes a mouse click away as soon as you break down the movement .
&quot; move the mouse , wait it until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . in this way you can move the pulling with pressed mouse button . &quot;
this residence time must submit to the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click brings out .
&quot; if the mouse button is switched on , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . &quot;
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt , these movements are stored in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt for the first time , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to move the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a slider with sound buff@@ ers , which you can adjust to a lower value to sh@@ orten response times . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window surrounding , please refer to the respective documentation to find out how to start a program . &quot;
&quot; set all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog . have you already pressed the button , the settings will be reset after the last pressing of the button . &quot;
&quot; the best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with default settings . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click is left without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can park the mouse on such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse moves , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t only clean@@ se the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would need to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and dirt can be easily scra@@ ped with a flat blade or finger nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . if you are using smart moving , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not mean that the operation can be termin@@ ated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; under another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you are able to run a mou@@ sec@@ lick , so the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse click and put the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want to have it . however , you can par@@ ken the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent move , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart for@@ ging is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it needs time before you can handle it . it &apos;s very likely to be able to copy it into the cli@@ pboard and paste it into the cli@@ pboard . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t use the smart move if you just need to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , use . select text instead as follows : run a mouse click on an end of the text area and press the Shift key while clicking the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this makes every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X window ; it should be the case on most system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker .
&quot; this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome , and to prevent the activation of the Mau@@ sta@@ sten pa@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a drag process before the mouse button is left . in this way , drag and drop can be done with the mouse . &quot;
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ( specify this &amp; URL ; in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ) .

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the silent users can speak their computer for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list of phrases that should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command which is later used for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the Setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text pass@@ book . from the text@@ book books you can often choose text passages without having to type them . the text passages can be edited , of course . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) , you specify the dictionary for the word @-@ course . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reading the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can use the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary , so that only properly letter words can be recorded in the course of the word . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly structured and contains essentially a input field for the key hub of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a run memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth ; correctly , you can enter the sentences in the input field you want to hear . each spoken set is attached to the run memory . you can select from it phrases that should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... Open the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , the page of the word and the page K@@ TT@@ SD . &quot;
in the input field of the box card speech output you specify the command to call the language generator . in the selection box below the input field you specify the character encoding with the text to the voice generator .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text should be passed as standard input to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be given as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your voice generator . examples for this can be found in the App@@ endix . &quot;
&quot; using the possibility to use k@@ tt@@ s@@ d as language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service . if that is successful , the further settings are being developed on this page . the k@@ tt@@ s@@ d voice service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications have a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or the choice of a text passage from the menu or in the bar for text pass@@ ers . &quot;
the selected text passage is added to the input field with the selection of In the input field the selected text passage will be transferred to the input field .
&quot; with the second selection box close to the editing window for text pass@@ book , you can specify whether the text pass@@ book is to be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; when selecting a text@@ book book , the book will be saved . if you choose to make changes , the text@@ book book will not be saved . &quot;

&quot; with the buttons on the right , you can delete or add dic@@ tionaries which change the order of books or export them into a file . below the list you can specify the name and the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary to include just written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; this option allows you to merge the available dic@@ tionaries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tionaries are merged , and how these weights are to be put together . &quot;
&quot; this option allows you to create a new , empty dictionary without any entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth , automatically added to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for editing text pass@@ ers is divided into two sections . in the upper part , the text@@ book books are presented as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected item . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text@@ book book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; you can delete actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either using the menu bar , tool@@ bar or over a drop @-@ up menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text pass@@ ers or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new location , or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key . &quot;

&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool bar is displayed using buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is located directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a narrow body is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar is displayed directly under the tool@@ bar . click on the left side and drag the tool@@ bar to another place . &quot;
&quot; probably , you do not have the command for the voice output correctly or not fully entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; setup the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the card board . ( see Settings dialog for voice synthes@@ izer on further details . ) &quot;
&quot; Festival is a voice @-@ edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and spread without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival will be installed in / usr / local / festival . the command for voice output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and spread without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for the set of voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ eware . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . he converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to break the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / ji@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax often swal@@ lowed the last sign of the text , so that an additional character must be added . the complete command is therefore more complex than in other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo $ ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / ji@@ fax / t@@ xt@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line .
&quot; the voice output D@@ äm@@ on from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further voice service , all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; as the setting of the language generator is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use the possibility of k@@ tt@@ s@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; for setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD voice service , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for voice generator ) , but depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , can let text be issued by the computer . it will be saved as a list of spoken sentences , which the user can re@@ generate again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth contains no voice synthes@@ izer . on the computer a voice synthes@@ izer must be installed .

&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ xml , which belongs to the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . you remove the tags br and b from the messages sent to send mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed as provided in most cases . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is edited before it will be sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to select wrong spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to deal with certain defici@@ encies of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the issue of the warning .
&quot; messages have the highest priority . a message is interrupted , normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page , you can talk with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also messages . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text entries . each order that you encounter from the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text entries . text entries are intended for the output of longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es with the exception of the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one reads , this output will be stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . they will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
&quot; filter the text and add it to the next filter . at the moment , there are three types of filters . &quot;
filters are executed as modules . in the future there can still be further types of filters .
you can either be used as words or as regular expressions like : - ) by text or for form@@ atting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehen@@ sible form .
&quot; &amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format , some X@@ SL@@ T files are included to the translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; you can filter orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set a female voice , you can read text from K@@ DE messages . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for a voice output . if the filter is determined that his rules are not met , the text remains unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification of &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it will be edited by all activated filters that were set on the page below . processing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the servic@@ ed normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be displayed in the following setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; a list of words or regular expressions can be entered as comparison pattern . if this pattern is found in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; for your filter , enter a name . you can choose to choose the name of the other filter . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save or delete the current list . upload a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language , the filter is used only if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by Kom@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
the application ID running programs will be sent to q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; DB@@ us ; numbers don &apos;t have to leave you . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 shows you may only copy copies .
&quot; if all the input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the character compilation filter regularly uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must be limited by divi@@ ders ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you can &apos;t find instructions to write regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package of ambig@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; conver@@ ters translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conversion . however , it can only be applied on well @-@ shaped XML . &quot;
enter the path for x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the PAT@@ H environment variable is x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the spokes@@ person selection filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the board map speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can specify that texts by a female voice should be read from a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filters , there is a spokesman for the text . &quot;
&quot; is a value entered here , if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; if the text has been shown above the filter conditions , the speaker will be selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements . click on the right button to display the dialog selection dialog . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your spokes@@ person settings or delete all settings .
the spokes@@ person selection filter will only apply to the text when all conditions are applied with one entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must register at least one condition .
&quot; the voice output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; with the programm@@ ers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; DB@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice synthes@@ izer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ DB@@ us ; interface of the voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is is available on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand speech output across the &amp; DB@@ us ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from program k@@ tt@@ s@@ d via the object K@@ speech .
&quot; in doing so , text of text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands
&quot; open two &amp; console ; -@@ Window . start k@@ tt@@ s@@ d in one window , then k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Um@@ de@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for the festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that SA@@ BLE works at all . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or inter@@ point characters appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped , or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sch . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the drawing encoding is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . there are problems with certain characters or words , may possibly be corrected by a cartoon holder filter . see . &quot;

&quot; the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a customizable module architecture for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend &amp; kt@@ ts ; for using another synthes@@ iz@@ ers , please contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . &quot;
&quot; to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages and development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you refer to the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts , refer to the source code for k@@ de@@ dly or downloaded every night currently created tables , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , first check if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your voice synthes@@ izer . this allows you to use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program K@@ tt@@ ms@@ g is designed to be developed so that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is to be developed , and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken into individual sentences . the user may withdraw the sentence or cancel , repeat or cancel the issue . &quot;
&quot; if you use text to &amp; kt@@ ts , you can request the properties of the preferred subscri@@ ber for the issue . if you want to have a spokes@@ person , this may be used , otherwise it will be automatically selected by the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you choose to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts , see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the map card to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the map card is displayed in the list , as an example is shown in the following the installation of the module for Festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found under . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PAT@@ H , you &apos;ll have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text , which is given to the festival . when voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts are known , this setting will automatically be made . generally , Western languages use ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sliders you adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you don &apos;t select a number of controllers and display this gray , the selected voice can &apos;t be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded in multiple seconds due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices will be loaded faster when starting K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with greater memory usage ) the first set is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you don &apos;t have to set up a speaker ( or forget to click on it ) . see . &quot;
&quot; this check box is marked by k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr the program window k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the symbol k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr doesn &apos;t run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , together with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently processed set . the narr@@ ator ID is equal to the column ID on the map card . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can set up or go back in the list below , pre@@ - or go back . ( but not each order consists of several sentences ) . &quot;
&quot; with one click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to see the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; for more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts , please find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , then &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are shown in the list , you need to install at least one module . have you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device . see also &quot;
&quot; set the subscri@@ ber speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to half and 200@@ cm ; % of the double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed . &quot;
click on to take the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M units and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , select standard . &quot;
&quot; on this card card you can set special actions , which will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders : &quot;
the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the preview of the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message is interrupted by regular text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just a long text on a website , you can talk with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone gre@@ ets someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played , when a normal text order is interrupted . if both conduc@@ tive sound and conduc@@ tive message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card card are valid only for normal text entries . for news , warnings and the issues of screen reproduction there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ not@@ fy messages can be read , start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card card aler@@ ts will appear . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to restri@@ ct the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; the other settings are not marked , the other settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no aler@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , noti@@ fications , where a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog box appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent , if someone mentioned your nick@@ name in a IRC message . &quot;
&quot; all events , which are not specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
use this selection box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event arrives . you have the following options :
&quot; if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the user &apos;s characteristics here . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map card speaker as a top entry . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if a particular event is specified for a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list ) .
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for aler@@ ts to a file . use the button store to load saved settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Delete . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially , only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available : &quot;
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British ) , since this is the standard voice , the festival in the issue of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ onic . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ limit recognition filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . this allows &amp; kt@@ ts to start automatically , because only the first set can be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . &quot;
&quot; for the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , you can change its settings or add another set @-@ limit filter , but beginners will get out of it . &quot;
&quot; in the simpl@@ est way you will learn the establishment of the speaker selection by sample . switch off the speaker selection and select text for the preview . check out the list selection , change some properties and check how the choice of the speaker is changed . if you have to have more than one speaker , you will have to have more than one speaker . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; you can edit text entries on the card card , even if the voice synthes@@ izer doesn &apos;t support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set @-@ limit filter is automatically set up when you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be turned off , unless you know what you do . &quot;
&quot; compare text with a regular expression for punc@@ tu@@ ation and app@@ end a tab@@ ular sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the stat@@ utes , and note that the default set @-@ limit filter is reserved to the character set . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD filters will never be applied &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ ts ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen reproduction . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal set @-@ limit filter , you can paste it again by uploading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
the card card board selection allows you to over@@ write the speaker settings for the application . the card card is displayed if the card card is displayed .
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the map card speaker ) . in other words : there are no speaker properties .
&quot; if you do not delete or edit the settings of the subscri@@ ber , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker of the speaker , which corresponds to the original features originally created . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the buttons buttons .
&quot; if this feature does not play a role , do not give anything . &quot;
check this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also place multiple mark@@ ings here .
&quot; as the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a primary feature . &quot;
&quot; in order to use all the features in the field of speaker , you are able to delete the following below , click on the standard speaker and then use the Speaker , which corresponds to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is valid for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , entering 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; if the problem is not solved , you may try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I play music at the same time , when I get a text order , fri@@ ght@@ ens &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message that states : 3 Replies to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . references for possible solutions can be found on the AL@@ SA @-@ project website ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have installed an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in the festival , but k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr shows this voice . &quot;
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / k@@ tt@@ s@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / voices the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; in which you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the card card audio there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program must be installed and can be moved over the PAT@@ H environment variable . some synthes@@ izer modules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for speaking speed are ignored , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; default . ( this is that HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are completely mu@@ tig , change the .@@ x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML format changes , and set up the subscri@@ ber speed . &quot;
&quot; I do not create web pages with a female voice . I have set up a female festival spokes@@ person , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Tag SA@@ BLE GEN@@ DER doesn &apos;t seem to function . so that festival does not produce any mistakes , the x@@ sl file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added an own cartoon holder filter , and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more preview or go back . on the card company orders will be displayed , the order is only from one sentence . what do I do wrong ? &quot;
&quot; inter@@ point characters ( point , question mark , ex@@ clam@@ ation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ icol@@ on ) may not be filtered . &quot;

the following modules for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a running time dependency of non @-@ free software . ( not @-@ free according to the direc@@ tives of Debian distribution ) .
&quot; as default setting &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify --@@ pre@@ fix = target . for example &quot;
&quot; in Debian systems / usr / local the correct folder for programs , which are translated from sources . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first if your voice synthes@@ izer is working properly . follow the instructions you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ izer , which is open source code . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . help with the instructions provided with Festival , you need to install web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in the festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cyr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . look for Festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ illi@@ c like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; - synthes@@ izer takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
&quot; note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice @-@ sharing system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ xt@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be produced from German lyrics Di@@ phones . for more information , please see . &quot;
&quot; in this process , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival , to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ t files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ folder installed , but in the folder festival / lib / . &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival und &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; , then download MS German Festival &quot;
&quot; in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find instructions in the file RE@@ AD@@ ME in the package you downloaded . ( for the use with Festival 2.0 , you will not need to translate the festival ) . then add the following lines into the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;

&quot; start k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr . on the map of the map , click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and Epo@@ s T@@ TS voice synthes@@ izer . if the epoch programs are not available in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the map card . enter in a &amp; console ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language synthes@@ izer that has been written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; virtual machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can either set the sound level , volume or speaking speed . &quot;
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language synthes@@ izer that can be controlled in a &amp; console ; the command line can be controlled .
&quot; best use a command , which writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows the management of network interfaces , routing , and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting the K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; Package has been developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; to enable users to create a simple interface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; shown . the network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Pre@@ ferences in &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device shows and setting the network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices for installing &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded with the following files according to the kernel version : &quot;
the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected .
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the Dutch selection is offered . it is the platform from the list that best meets the distribution and Rel@@ e@@ as@@ mission . &quot;
&quot; the changing of network settings is only possible in system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in system management mode , click the button System Management mode at the right lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . &quot;
the network interfaces are used to manage network devices . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces you can perform the following tasks :
the settings shown on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button on the button ... in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; using automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings will be retri@@ eved from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at any system start , so no further adjustments are required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the option Manu@@ ell can be made using the TCP / IP configuration without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask is the sub@@ net mask . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; console , you can determine whether the requested address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched off . switching an off network device will be activated by selecting the list and click on interface ...
network devices can be activated or switched off . turn off an enabled network device by selecting from the list and click interface ...
sets the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net that con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
&quot; if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer is asking for IP addresses , DNS sol@@ ves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the computer for the name resolution portion of the name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog . &quot;
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select one entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the dialog . &quot;
&quot; the list name known calcul@@ ator describes the host@@ name IP address method for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used with boot when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally contains the list name known computer some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be shown .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known computer has several alias names , de button add several times and enter another alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a particular known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Recy@@ cle Calcul@@ ator is displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of the static hosts . &quot;
the settings set in the network settings are not immediately implemented in the system . in order to enable the changes you need to be placed in a &amp; console ; the following command will be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
&quot; for installing binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is enough when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed . &quot;
the installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s simply the rpm package and in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this will only be recommended for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile the following commands . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology is given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files are discussed . &quot;
this area can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endix only basic information about the integration of the PC is communic@@ ated into a small ( home ) network .
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found large distribution . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is to note the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , am &amp; eg ; Work@@ station is the network administrator that can be used to be a valid IP address or if available , the IP address can not be selected anywhere ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the Internet , therefore their arbitrary use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , usually addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.@@ 0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . &quot;
&quot; the network address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 has assigned its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; are affected and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes modified with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections there is another content as defined there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in the su@@ ck config . another stand is expected to occur . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on t@@ ar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a band . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife gave : how much longer does it take , when it sec@@ ures ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be taken from &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; trains the band back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the band . recognizes and k@@ dat ; the preview on the band does not , you &apos;ll be asked if the band is to be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; see &amp; k@@ dat ; the preview , search for the matching index on your plate . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band index should be re@@ constructed . &quot;
&quot; if everything has gone smoothly , the symbol for the band is changed to indicate that the band has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the belt can now be searched through out of the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the ban@@ des , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to evaluate this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; by changing the symbol for the band , that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be disc@@ arded without any danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band from &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat ; &quot;
&quot; a band type must be form@@ atted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to form@@ atting in &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not correspond to form@@ atting in &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not require form@@ atting , before you are form@@ atted before using the band from &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not require a form@@ atting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives cannot be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the tape . all data on the band is lost ! after finishing the form@@ atting process , the band is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the detected files . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is secured .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are saved .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are saved .
click the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the Backup menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives for the drive . only the selected file or folder is checked .
select the files in one of the archives for the band with a h@@ ack . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the test process has been started , dialog settings for check . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can create the restore , the files that are to be restored will be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or the sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the required files from one of the archives using a folder . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are restored .
click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the menu .
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog for recovery will appear . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog will be restored . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file based on the band contents . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index to two types of tape :
this ensures a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current work folder in which the backup should be made . the list of the detected files will be updated automatically according to the selected work folder .
&quot; for all folders that are listed under backup files , you can only register the files that are located on the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are on other file systems , you can register separately under backup files . each entry is viewed from t@@ ar independent of the other . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine which files have been changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . &quot;
the name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
removes the snap@@ shot file before calling t@@ ar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . the following settings can be set :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transm@@ it@@ ters &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is integrated , the command is loaded to the drive . in some drives it is necessary before reading or write operations . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , you try to lock &amp; k@@ dat ; this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; when the option is turned on , the dis@@ integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically ej@@ ected the band . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy streaming . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ ed block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must share the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band is form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the gang . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is as follows : &quot;
&quot; the band ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , with the name of the full name of the system in which the band has been form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds that have been form@@ atted since the time in which the band has been form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; the rest of the files on the band are pure t@@ ar archives , which can be used directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar . even other t@@ ar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental f@@ uses . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is integrated .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can obtain information about your system , or where the system can access the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can obtain information about your system , or where the system has the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows for quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features , which can be filtered and analysed using the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions , including : &quot;
support for many different types of log files for the format of the Sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log is trying to open the most important protocol file of the system - to open the system protocol . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter strip to filter after a selected crit@@ erion , or manually . &quot;
&quot; you can naturally also select another entry . the string of the filter search term will only be compens@@ ated by the entries in the selected column . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the name of a process , and carry it out in the filter strip the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is activated in default setting and helps to detect the important protocol lines .
&quot; if you want to show only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can then be useful for example , if you want to investigate the output of a certain command , such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filter strip . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can ski@@ p the option to the new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new additions to the next protocol . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . in order to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display . &quot;

&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for controlling the program startup when starting the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I &apos;m not going to go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folder :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service that you want to run on a different run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things like set@@ serial , which only once started . &quot;
you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel searches for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably find that the pre @-@ set Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can re@@ boot / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and edit the 3 . be very careful when you start to restart the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead of each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
&quot; how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written so written that there is a argument like start and stop . you can actually start this script by hand on the command line , as follows : &quot;
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if a K contains , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains a S , the script will start with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server -@@ Run@@ level , which only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another po@@ inter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start at this level ( or stop ) .
you can move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by removing it somewhere else . this happens only if they are removed from the range of available system services .
&quot; note : entries will be postpon@@ ed if you choose them to a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you need to select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu , even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to add the system service .
&quot; note : at present there is no possibility to restore entries that were thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab key to enable the various working areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move one entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ pboard ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry , press the button to open the properties dialog . use the Tab@@ ulator key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the button to accept changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings will be removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if they are available .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ? &quot;
then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply termin@@ ated without a message , if your configuration files are not available or incor@@ rectly arranged . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this can be added to this manual . &quot;
&quot; this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program , you can manage the users and groups of your system . &quot;
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter of &amp; k@@ user ; reading . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the entry Save in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two card boards , user and user groups list . for editing , select the desired user or group with double @-@ click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some card boards are only displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings . only if you have limited space restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings . other cards appear if Shadow - passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd will be installed like in BSD @-@ Unix . &quot;
&quot; the card board password management appears , if Shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd like in BSD -@@ Unix are installed . &quot;
&quot; this card card appears only if for at least a limited file system space constra@@ int ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , each user parameters can be changed , whereby the space restrictions are specified in KB : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the field fil@@ esystem with space limitation
&quot; the card board groups inform@@ s about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs , find in the primary group . furthermore , the user can be member in other groups by selecting them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select from the menu User or Group or click the matching button of the tool@@ bar . the editing or del@@ e@@ tion of the selected user or the selected group works . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO Boot@@ manager , add and change the boot password , remove and change the time up to boot the standard operating system that add the default operating system , remove , change , change and more . &quot;
