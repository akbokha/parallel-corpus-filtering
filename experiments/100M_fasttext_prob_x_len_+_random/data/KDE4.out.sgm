<seg id="377">"the reason why you use a color-managed workflow, the colors shown by your camera or scanners are showing a predictable variance of the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanners. you can print or publish the colors you print or publish them from your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about colour management. in addition, links with deeper information enable you to make your own informed decisions so that you can obtain the desired results."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your images meet all six of the criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor which is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are by email or web where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if sRGB is so well functioning and the life for everyone is so easy, why should one use another color space and make sure that you have to think about colour management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colours that we can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colours that we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colours in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms on info and then click on Information About RGB working Spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calibrate my monitor when I decided to work in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"yes! if you work in the sRGB colour space or not, you have to calibrate your monitor, since sRGB of it is that your; monitor to sRGB is calibrated. if you are used as a color space of sRGB, you must either use your monitor to the sRGB standard, using a matching monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections which can be improved in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions Normalize, Accept, Automatic Ability and Concontrast from the menu Corrigation Automatic correction will attempt automatically from your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see what is best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scrolls the luminous values over the whole picture so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method adjusts the brightness ratio of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel."</seg>
<seg id="393">"contrast: this method improves the contrast and the brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values in between the lowest and highest values in between. this is only visible in balanced images, and can be a good correction for bad photos."</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digiKam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space with 8-bit per color. if you can do the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better off."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright by Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"using a button, you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum will appear. the sum is called Luminance."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your score depends on shadow, saturation and gamma."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">"if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. you will see the combined result in the white balance. this is displayed as a pure indicator, and has no effect on the final image."</seg>
<seg id="404">"the buttons Save as and Load are exactly this. every setting of the white balance that you have set, you can store them in a text file and reload them later."</seg>
<seg id="405">The button presets presets all filter values back to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings can be created as your original. if you save them your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16 bit encoding is better for high-quality images. this encoding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw images. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is available in the menu under colors. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, allowing you to use them for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always make the same mistakes and you always need the same correction. in the manual for the correction correction you will find more information."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under paints gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"& digiKam; tool color effects provides four color effects, a solar system effect, a Velvia filter, a Neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, solar-ization was also called Sabatier, an effect of the result of a short flashing light and then completed the development of the picture. the colour, darker areas protected the delicate photographic paper from the additional light. this was a part of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity control the solar cells. at about 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system. the original image is the (1) and that is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid-Filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquoth; effect. it differs from a saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours brilliant and glow. try it simple, it embellish many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquoth. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquoth; and thus a reference for its smooth texture. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the Neonfilter simulates neon light at the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeats the thickness of the neon light. in large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">"digital cameras have frequently encountered problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to change the colour contrast and the brightness of the photos. you can look at the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu. as soon as you are happy with the results, use the Ok button and you will be applied."</seg>
<seg id="418">"in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. all changes you can perform in the preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminchiness / contrast / gamma, the tool is set to improve exposure. even if the dialog on this tool is very complicated, you need only the range of sliders."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected range. under the graph there are three sliders into the left and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controller and make sure the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be dynamically, based on the settings of the image, and the following options are available on the left-hand side."</seg>
<seg id="423">"scaling: with this selection box can be set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is useful."</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controllers: the highest for the dark tones, the mean for the bright tones and the lowest for medium sounds, often called Gammages."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pinpoints can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and light tones. moreover, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as in the input values.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons you can store the set values in the file system and reloaded back later. this is used to use the Gimp Levels format.</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the Histocking System for Rot-, Green, Blue and the Luminana channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator which means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">"below you can see an example of the adjustment of input values to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left hand, half of the original and the target image is displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically based on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:"</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows the channel to be changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">"in addition to this box, two icons are located between a linear and a logarithmic view. in this case, the linear mode of the meaningful color creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps."</seg>
<seg id="435">"if you move a cursor to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones will correspond with darker output holes and that the corresponding image pixel will be darker."</seg>
<seg id="436">"on the preview of the original photos a red marker is shown. if you want to change this marking on the range you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve that is the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste."</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">"if you want this method and the three color pipettes, you automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, medium and sunlight. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve."</seg>
<seg id="439">"if more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & digiKam; jQuery Slider is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shade of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another advanced tool for mixing the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu Color channel mixer of the images.</seg>
<seg id="443">"with the channel selection box, you can choose the colour for the histogram: this gives you a first indication as you can correct the canals by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as compared to your own riders."</seg>
<seg id="444">"the preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding colour value."</seg>
<seg id="445">"the controls for the module are right below: control for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you are able to keep Luminance, the image will also keep the general brightness even if you are also using the option Monochrom, since the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-white portraits."</seg>
<seg id="446">"sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of color to a visible noise that comes from the color channel. colour glasses consists of small noise artifacts that will not appear in the same place in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel may appear differently. if this is the case, you can improve your monochrom conversion in which you can reduce the color space."</seg>
<seg id="447">"save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any set of mixer settings can be saved for later, and then load. the file format is the Gimp channel mixer format."</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator which means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been adjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>

<seg id="479">& digiKam; three different tools are available for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">The algorithm has been taken from Gimp and is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"refocus is possibly the best of the three, as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting."</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitized images require a correction of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="484">Photos in raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">"if you disable this, you get the control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening workpiece. you can then scroll through the menu entry."</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should be cautious because the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases sharpness of the edges, but also reinforces the noise. in general, the most suitable technique to sharpen the tool is refocussed. you can reach it via the menu entry Corrigation. you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw a little bit soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool to draw a little bit soft, and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is a very good tool to remove mute from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The preview window shows the output of the filter with current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should first try out first. an increase in the radius or the amount reinforce the effect."</seg>
<seg id="492">"the radius, like many pixels on each side of a channel by the filter. high resolution images allow greater radii. they should therefore sharpen pictures best in their final resolution."</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wisely image, which is added to the original. thus the thickness of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference-sum. one can thus define a minimum difference to a channel of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft exchange between the sounds are exempt from the sharpening and therefore avoid misunderstandings in faces, Himmler and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). blurred masked was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiKam; tool refocussing a picture by improving the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtering.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding is much better than the Gauß's folds. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result from the source pixies that are far from the original quel pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value is 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values are close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filters: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poorly helpful."</seg>
<seg id="502">"in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value of nonzero, you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can generate good results, especially if you choose great values for the circle-shaped sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameters that you have set, will be saved for later and can then be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before you use the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise you should use the module before you change the image. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later left uncomfortable artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress pictures, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"in general, Unsharp mask produces better results than sharpening. this could result in causing the unsharp mask to use a larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, unsharp mask must always create artefacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never be the effect of the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below, you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused picture, see:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods for the sharpness correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The knobs smoothes the sharpness of the range that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink tinplate allows a customized colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the tools developed in order to remove unnecessary artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by IMAGE team of GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CIMG project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains several presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available pre-adjustments are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the tab smoothness and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail level p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothness over the image."</seg>
<seg id="520">"alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly across all directions, while a value close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grilling or CCD noise, a high value of shaft-like patterns can be created."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p defines the relative smoothness. therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your picture."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. normally enough 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"the angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha small is chosen, it should also be small."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"linear interpolation: the more of quality that you get through the choice of this option is only low, but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to release it."</seg>
<seg id="527">"the buttons Save as and Load are exactly this. every setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file, and later loaded."</seg>
<seg id="528">"correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, however, it can take a long time and take a high CPU load after moving. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be removed using small artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that in Guatemala City is made with an analog camera. as you see there is a peculiar black Artefact in the foreground that caused by a bad movie storage during the journey. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiKam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a protected algorithm of Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moss; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, only the subwindow details and the submenu Advanced settings can remain with default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius control the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter."</seg>
<seg id="536">"if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be received and noise or lubrication occurs."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: control the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong it cannot be removed all the noise or noise peaks. set it on a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak roar or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">"light density: controls the brightness tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or light density to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process, which is controlled by the details settings."</seg>
<seg id="539">"color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or light density to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process, which is controlled by the details settings."</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamate tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas which are typically stronger.</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls the alignment of the phase jitter absorption. this value defines how fast the adaptive Filterradius reacts on variations of luminous density. if it is increased, the edges appear smooth when it is too high, can cause noise and phase jitter on the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is indicated with (1) and the corrected (2). the noise reduction was used with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">"sometimes a picture is crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw a little bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture. use this tool to draw soft signs with the menu entry, showing the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiKam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grains, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or later digitized images."</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CIMG project.</seg>
<seg id="548">"JPEG artifacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it."</seg>
<seg id="549">"the buttons Save as and Load are exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file, and later loaded."</seg>
<seg id="550">"photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, however, it can take a long time and take a high CPU load after moving. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button."</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can see how a photo with uniform noise can be restored.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grains on faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures are reduced to an old color photo that has been loaded with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that have been created by scanner lighting and photopapier. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">It uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">"bright, dead or hot pixels are particularly high-quality raw mode photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels."</seg>
<seg id="555">"this tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels; and" "quot; bright Pixelquot; and" "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image subcontractions method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels."</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the dark image. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">"if you have an old digital camera, it is important to record the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects."</seg>
<seg id="558">"first, as described in the previous section, you should load the right dark image to the image to the corrected image. note that the wizard will see the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session."</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview will help you correct the results within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select a field to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels.</seg>
<seg id="561">"Durcut: it is calculated on average of the neighbouring pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line."</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">"square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less pixels are drawn, to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square corners (1-dim), which then used to interpolate the pixels in the block."</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">"below, you can see the hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="566">"& digiKam; correction correction is a tool for correcting the vivitising, i.e. under exposed corners to correct an image."</seg>
<seg id="567">"far-angle objective, especially the middle and large photo format, can often illuminate the entire sensor area. instead, & quot; vignettierquot; (shady) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there."</seg>
<seg id="568">"many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 when the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise unsharpening effects are caused by movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the large exposure area of today's filter and colour and film depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by using an equivalent transformation on a raw image created without this filter. the algorithm is protected by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three regulators, you can control the correction correction filter and three further exposure of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the greatest density. the standard density is 2,0, which corresponds to an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or accidental a thickness of 2."</seg>
<seg id="572">"to adjust the target image with these options, you need to re-adjust the exposure of the target with these options, since you only need to increase the settings."</seg>
<seg id="573">"if you want to re-adjust the finish of the target image, then let the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digiKam menu."</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of viviating correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the viviation in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a luminous and contrast correction was also performed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiKam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second gradation deals the general geometric distortion of the lens and can fix the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">"the coefficient of the third graft has a similar circular effect, but flake on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool."</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grades corrected the remote corners opposite to the second gradient. if you combine these two can be virtually eliminated any geometric distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the thickness of the distortion of the second gradient.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the fourth gradient.</seg>
<seg id="582">"zoom: this value scrolls the image size, resulting in a correction of the first gradient due to negative values."</seg>
<seg id="583">"bright: this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it."</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are stored and used for the next start as standard values."</seg>
<seg id="585">The barrel or cushion-shaped correction should be carried out before any cutting or size changes.</seg>
<seg id="586">"to help you find the best correction you will find this tool a vertical and horizontal auxiliary line. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. in connection, you can fix the barrel / cushion distortion with the help of the lines."</seg>
<seg id="587">"if you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners."</seg>

<seg id="648">"the tool After aspect ratio saves his settings depending on image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you are using the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut picture and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the compositions help make it easier to embed your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangles are based on the principle of similarity.</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden mid: the golden middle is a division that grows on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of an Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden pitch is the Irratale number 1,618033988... and it was already used for the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to create your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you create your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number leads from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of its two progressed numbers."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle provides more fluid auxiliary lines when you assemble a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the gold spiral will bring you to your goal good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow."</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles."</seg>
<seg id="657">"in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are the central points of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles cannot be congruent triangles. diagonal to these lines can be a static object dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, you will create a effect of the professional photographer dynamic symmetry. try your picture focus on one of the chives and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't reach."</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic parts.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">Free rotation is a tool for turning a picture to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"if you make a photo, it happens easily that you can't keep the camera exactly vertical or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things around an angle are rotated. you can repair this with the & digiKam; drag and adjust the target angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. you can set the sliders back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"to help your help, the module creates a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to move the two lines. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">"after you have turned a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners."</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the function Automatic trimming. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the rotation. please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">This point is shown in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">"new width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty spaces created through the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="671">"new Height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty spaces created through the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left upper: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the picture is a little dirty. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after which you have adapted the perspective, you get unfortunate triangular holes at the corners."</seg>
<seg id="678">"the tool is used to move a part of the image into a direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. in other words, a rectangle is distorted into a parallelogram."</seg>
<seg id="679">"shoot your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can push horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will appear and the new dimensions of the target are displayed on the right of the preview window."</seg>
<seg id="680">"move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your picture."</seg>
<seg id="681">"after which you have done the shutter, the picture will wipe out a bit. for a single shot this effect is usually negligible, but two shots are generated twice as much wiper and therefore you should avoid this."</seg>
<seg id="682">"after sharpening, the image has unattractive triangular holes in the corners. one way to remove it is the image with transverse cutting from the images."</seg>
<seg id="683">"& digiKam; requires a number of libraries and other packages in order to read and write image formats. the formats available at the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiling. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digiKam."</seg>

<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive, because each pixel is still further split and adaptively because each pixel depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixels, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 subpixel, which can be followed individually and set up further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another possibility to reduce aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process, called jittering. if you switch jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular pattern."</seg>

<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good for music of young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without consideration to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that can be entered manually or by the program automatically from the freedb on the internet, are available as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the coders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoding programs explain the switch for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s is encoded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button title in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database, in which people can download the audio CDs that can download the information, so that all the other information can be downloaded instead of text: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>

<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; for use of freedb, the geographic will be used on the next mirror server. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the computers."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or downloaded (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that cdparanoia is used; anyone who wants to know more detail, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see To note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed first if this is not yet done."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the selected WAV files, the Kodiver and thus the file format can be selected. in the first opening are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compression for audio data) on the tab card to set up the encoding."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiver package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the codiver can be used. this is also necessary for predefined codes. more information about codiers are in Chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installation of a encoding, more information can be obtained through the input of a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drives, the write and readers, and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoding of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flc & etc;) are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>

<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, all understood, are still still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">"it must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example using a search engine, since it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do."</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not general-MIDI. in this case, the MIDI-Map general MIDI events are translated into events that understand the synthesizer."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the change patch to Bright Piano in events of the change patch to Trumpet, and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you just have a sound card, you do not need any MIDI map, because all Soundcards GM-compatible (including AWE and GUS cards, FM devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you must edit the corresponding file from hand (with your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all required conversion to play a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section which may appear as often as desired."</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END DEFINE KEYMAP "Name of Keymap..." END DEFINE KEYMAP "A further keymap... END DEFINE CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that DEFINE is used to show that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so that I can offer future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not general MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in this section, you can see how the patches of General MIDI can be depicted on your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign will be ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds that need this instrument to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard, for example, take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"if you want to play a MIDI file a touch with Patch 127 (rifle shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and play the tone 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that this patch is meant here with the term drum-patch of the patch, where each sound represents another percussionist instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one that means the sound level of the ever same drum (like some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to indicate how sounds can be depicted on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"like the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as its existence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use several keymaps only in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form sounds on the percussion channel. see for example the keymaps included.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to link some channels to others. if you want to replace the first and second channel, you can easily change the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will be used with the name name for this channel. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will be used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the Percussions-Channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio can be multiplied in which ratio of Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied by the value n, this is converted into the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is used because GM is a keyboard that will play a pitch of pitch with the value of 4096, to play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards are to be played by two tones up to one octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a little bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you can see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. if you have changed an instrument, the button doesn't shine more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views to display the played notes. view the View menu in the Settings section below the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD displays the speed, with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. if so, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down it. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can't force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file requires 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution."</seg>
<seg id="1686">"I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately."</seg>
<seg id="1687">"agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag and drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"in advance, activate automatic addition to the collection. otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection."</seg>
<seg id="1689">"you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow the playback. to restore the standard tempo, you can double click on the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1690">"I have a & kde; -work area a & konqueror; -windows with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a karaoke file), or I'd like to play a file, only change in the & konqueror; -window and drag the file into the window of & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1691">"if you just want to listen to a file quickly, without adding them to a collection, turn the setting automatic addition to the collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection."</seg>
<seg id="1692">"let's suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so, set the setting automatic addition to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection contains exactly that a MIDI file."</seg>

<seg id="2057">"perhaps the most popular extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user, the possibility to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language that you like to like. this is why this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository check if someone has done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you need to search an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc. then you need to create the docrc file."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"to select the location of your project, just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location."</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example you can see in the & PHP; documentation as something:</seg>
<seg id="2062">This forum is moderated beforehand: your contribution will only appear after being validated by a site administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this shows that it is about subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents of the directory are referenced directly to a file (and consistent at the top end of the building view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>

<seg id="2067">"a simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;)."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"now you can save your file docrc, though, after $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (such as you have specified this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are sure that these good and well worth are shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation has been used to the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to divide the separating resources (DTEP packages, toolbar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"the resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or else who are sent. in various places there is an email sending menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email sending tool bar with an email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree."</seg>

<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, before the installation, investigate & quantaplus, the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signatures. in case of problems it warns and it can be canceled correctly. if the integrity is given and the resource is correct, a message will appear with the specification of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work on XML language, currently not supported by & quantaplus; it will be time-consuming, because hundreds of day files may be required in tagxml format. there is the simpler way to convert a DTD to a DTEP package."</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD file menu and converting a DTD file. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>

<seg id="2081">"in & quantaplus, there are some key concepts."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus, the working area divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction is concerned with a number of components in & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; using, available."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"the project-related elements are only available within a certain project. this can be done from & CSS; patterns to tool bars with special promotions specifically for the files of a particular project. simple, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which makes the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editing window, the construction views, the boxes with information and the toolbar. please note, and for further information on these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or all carton, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmarks or execution of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click in the editing pane will lead to another context menu with regard to the edited document contents, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing the word under the mouse pointer or opening the file when the string is described under the mouse pointer."</seg>
<seg id="2089">"currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of the further enlargement of & quantaplus, the toolbar will be adapted to the new functions and thus associated user needs."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the use of toolbars is really easy. if it is a simple day, e.g. & lt; pushes; in your document, then click the icon that represents the day. now you can enter the data for this just added tag. if you want to insert the data for this just added tag, you can fill in a dialog different fields."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"the building views (QIT;) enable it to navigate to & quantaplus, to navigate, open it and through strips. in the presentation with card conductors are available for files, project, templates, documentation structure, scripts, attributes and documentation."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"project management is a powerful tool that is & quantaplus, providing. this view shows all files in the project and allows the managing of files in the project using a right mouse click. actions like adding, removal, uploading or delete the files from the storage medium can be done using the context menu."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"another possibility to & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories, depending on how they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus. global templates are always available, local templates are available only for the corresponding user and templates in projects."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of the integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with this view, you can display the internal structure of the active document. by clicking an element the cursor will be placed in the document to the position of the element. by right clicking of an element, a list of commands will open to the navigation and refresher of the tree."</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it it can change attributes and namespace. the application-oriented application system enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">"here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and edited."</seg>

<seg id="2100">This card lets you find information about each in Quanta running script. for example the DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This card trick shows all errors in the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed will give all error messages (such that there is) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"the & quantaplus, toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"another function of & quantaplus, is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantaplus; files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and do not run here."</seg>

<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I couldn't see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps the indentation had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, any amount of other useful functions were added."</seg>
<seg id="2285">"if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window."</seg>

<seg id="2290">"differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visible. if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can easily copy the file name of the first file. example:"</seg>

<seg id="2842">"when setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore their arbitrary use is possible."</seg>

<seg id="2847">"the network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 has assigned its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle."</seg>

<seg id="2924">"for all folders that are listed under backup files, you can only register the files that are located on the same file system, such as the folder. folders that are on other file systems, you can register separately under backup files. each entry is viewed from tar independent of the other."</seg>

<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init develops rapidly to the standard for controlling the program startup when starting the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I'm not going to go further on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following further folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service that you want to run on a different runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things like setserial, which only once started."</seg>
<seg id="2962">You can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for different places after the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably find that the pre-set Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can reboot / etc / inittab by hand and edit the 3. be very careful when you start to restart the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead of each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written so written that there is a argument like start and stop. you can actually start this script by hand on the command line, as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if a K contains, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script will start with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server -Runlevel, which only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by removing it somewhere else. this happens only if they are removed from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be postponed if you choose them to a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you need to select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu, even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present there is no possibility to restore entries that were thrown into the Recycle Bin. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab key to enable the various working areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move one entry into another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry, press the button to open the properties dialog. use the Tabulator key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the button to accept changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings will be removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if they are available.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine starts constantly. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (like & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply terminated without a message, if your configuration files are not available or incorrectly arranged."</seg>
