&quot; although I had visited the USA for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American films , American music , read American authors , and operated his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a very profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist for an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gar@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terrible reporter , who had to occupy the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ Magn@@ aten , who wanted to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; according to Method Man , &quot; I was it as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only intensi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose diversity is so welcoming , that you can always be who you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of equal people . &quot;
I even wrote a very shy love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
&quot; the most unusual aspect of his asc@@ en@@ sion is for me , as he goes with his narrow face . &quot;
&quot; he keeps his mind behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he tells exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and openly declar@@ es his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted for him for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won in the Republi@@ can election , was the highest number ever achieved by the Party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his voters to meet people whom I met in Phoenix during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that people from around the world , a deeply believing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Tr@@ um@@ ps did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met us in our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the Phoenix S@@ uns .
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , fighting her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; it still adap@@ ts to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , which always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew le@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , who helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and those who em@@ bark@@ ed through them are deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump called his way to nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they gave me a stop and the counter@@ part to its limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the debate with the idea that people have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost the heart broke me . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as r@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; the people involved , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act on another way and think .
it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fears are not taken into account by the h@@ ectic changes in their communities .
&quot; it could be that these voters , of whom most know , have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that they have disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who commented on the cruel decision to elev@@ ate a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look differently than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( including the &quot; &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ) : as much as &quot; &quot; c@@ asser@@ tion of the Wh@@ ites against all other ethnic groups &quot; &quot; ; word game from white in attack on the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means so much as Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the great Van Jones , has exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people all over the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is a powerful idea - which beliefs or background are always welcome , America is always welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan man , whose story , as he says himself , nowhere else in the world . &quot;
&quot; however , with the choice Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge portion of the white American of this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back on the helm , say . &quot;
&quot; in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally in H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; should Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; fr@@ o the crowd . &quot;
have Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and silent &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; thank you , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t your American &quot; . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps land , said the news . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Municip@@ ality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of Cat@@ eur@@ a together ?
&quot; the music that is played in both places , not only has changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a big g@@ arb@@ age d@@ ump , just 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds apart from nearby pre@@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now La b@@ anda de m@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : one of the children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and violence . &quot;
&quot; but it changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project , and the youth had a rare hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments towards the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi writes : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they are always laugh@@ ing and with bright eyes and play in the tru@@ ce you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from g@@ arb@@ age
&quot; more than 7@@ 5,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically at the biggest g@@ arb@@ age d@@ ump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in the capital - on instruments that are made of recycl@@ able waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re @-@ prepared instruments that consist of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recycl@@ er started by F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez began to turn parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , c@@ elli , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article of Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez rec@@ alls a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , at the beginning : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se , and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin made of waste produced .
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments from re @-@ prepared material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Waste Sett@@ lement ) records the musical performance :
the world creates about a billion tonnes of g@@ arb@@ age every year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like men in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectac@@ le of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this article , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication occurs within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for joint use of content .
&quot; at that time , West Africa was known that this ship had already operated fishing fishing in Liby@@ an waters before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law cr@@ us@@ ade of this kind to their co@@ asts .
&quot; in Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the commander , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Sey@@ ch@@ elles mobili@@ zed rapidly against the ship . they refused to divide one of their ports , and refused to share a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Prime Minister is surrounded by countries which you simply refused &quot; , &quot; Benedict Ki@@ il@@ u rec@@ alls a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship &apos;s time and persec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , due to pl@@ under@@ ing the fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects the criminal practices and protecting resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , members of this network are the six countries that had exp@@ elled the Prime Minister from their waters . &quot;
this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden where it is extremely difficult to pick up . thus the illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing regions .
&quot; due to the obvious mis@@ cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can damage ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fish@@ eries were imp@@ aired by bureauc@@ ratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions are now in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on susp@@ icious activities or details that you notice or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive , if they move on the open sea by means of satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fly in prohibited areas , such as those that indicate that a ship invites his caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ideal case , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a criminal off@@ ense . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports . what means that the ships may not sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay for the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owners , which means that the illegal fishing is finan@@ cially worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already @-@ named platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenues , which will lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of the illegal fisher@@ y that inv@@ ests in East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing villages , which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also those illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; such practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , fake licence papers , indication of imagin@@ ative names , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they specifically use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non @-@ complete control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship could fly illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal hat@@ ch@@ hole is trying to close the F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; so far , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its creation , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ icious ships . &quot;
it has revealed criminal networks that had fal@@ si@@ fied lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found it w@@ inged ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us rather far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to identify susp@@ icious ships .

&quot; the Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to pick up illegal ships . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships can switch off their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be used by satell@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland also helps build a system that connects different information levels , and F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find a criminal ag@@ ating ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African countries actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has recently opened the Global Fishing Watch platform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has to run a similar project where a global system permits prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships , used earlier without license and hardly had consequences , know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i countries now have a 33 % rise in fish@@ eries sales since fish@@ boats have ever bought more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia decided to pick up Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors found there on board tow@@ ing nets whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will disappear every year by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries have joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they now fight the illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i. . &quot; &quot; Safety is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country could report his first great triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the conduct of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , the ship has been stab@@ bed to fish@@ eries , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative working method for protecting the oc@@ eans is actually working throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , New York Times and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of con@@ quer the country &quot;
the road mot@@ ions in Venezuela only seem to be the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the reform of the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans re@@ acted in their eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country in order to gather together on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the H@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example , the re@@ sign@@ ation of Venezuela ) can be found in pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them . &quot;
&quot; the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among other things in the Bar@@ inas area , in the An@@ den@@ regions MÃ©ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north of the country Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isl@@ a Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country deteri@@ or@@ ated continuously , which is noticeable in the daily life of the Vene@@ tians by a acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the administration of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the deport@@ ation of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence of the world belong to the highest in the world ( the inflation rate will be estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine , the referendum for many as the only way to con@@ quer its institutional structures and close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2015 , the opposition to the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos;s electoral alliance , and a march to the Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , called the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government , should continue to continue . &quot;

&quot; the return of Venezuela &quot; &quot; Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Program &quot; &quot; The Return of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the MÃ¤r@@ schen , which are published in real @-@ time , testi@@ fy among others an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also con@@ front@@ ations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most commonly shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator , who calls through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I have hunger ? &quot;
&quot; will you kill me , because I have fam@@ ine ? &quot; &quot; the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans scre@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; it is enough , without a shit . &quot;
&quot; you might want to change the Directory as well if you need to have your uploaded images placed in e.g. &quot; &quot; www / gallery / &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , pictures that tell of conflicts , as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
especially large waves struck the news of police repression in the central @-@ north town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local Cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed supporters of the government .
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the state of T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skirts , because one could see anything that many national gar@@ den@@ ers do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic is already making a round which forms the extent of suppression per day : &quot;
&quot; in this way , the dictatorship of the proletariat has oppressed the country . &quot;
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the claim after a minist@@ erial procedure - this was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the street .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado maintain that 1 % of signatures are fake .
here is your office recovery !
on the street !
&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has done little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis , rather than to leave critical voices : &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the MÃ¤r@@ sche always take more on frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than to work or shopping . &quot;

the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of C@@ Ã³r@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; in the process that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; beginning with the brush , the same name as his father to carry up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
&quot; for 34 years , he maintained the family secret to himself . &quot;
&quot; in the situation , I believed that it was in order . &quot;
I felt like a secret mag@@ ician .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , one doesn &apos;t notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I could not know that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ urers and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ Offic@@ ers . during the Argent@@ ine military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , his father from 1976 to 1978 , his father from 1976 to 1978 , was his father from 1976 to 1978 , in the prison La Per@@ la . &quot;

from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had been friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
&quot; all known him &quot; &quot; Kent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
&quot; you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would become a mag@@ ician . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so , my father had moved me . &quot;
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; all possible documents : university certificates , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&quot; the prisoners were tor@@ tured , &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with everything in 1976 .
&quot; at first and during the last time , he left me at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on this day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed out to an open space and said :
the prisoners were tor@@ tured .
&quot; I went in and saw a couch , tor@@ tured on man . &quot;
she looked like a bed and metal springs .
&quot; later , I found that it was fast@@ ened to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there . &quot;
&quot; they f@@ elled a man with towel to the bed , poured it with water and pursued him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ it@@ als . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ bly ... like a dirty win@@ dle .
&quot; years later when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were m@@ asked with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were bound to bind . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilians who was also accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men were facing with the face - all were tied on hands and feet .
&quot; in the vicinity of the entrance , people quietly sit on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoner , he said , &quot; &quot; What is you doing so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why did you bring me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told me about it .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
&quot; I know that &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man and killed a man . &quot;
&quot; according to the survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a trial , was also indic@@ ted by the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of La Per@@ la Memorial , through the former fol@@ ter@@ houses . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
&quot; if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ hum@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; if they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the top came to be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War &apos; mare &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things by home .
&quot; at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war mare &quot; &quot; - as they knew . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later at the military , I was clear that warfare was a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military insignia that you fought against an enemy you fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , painting , money ... ste@@ als , then there is no war of war but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered : and you , who st@@ ashed cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he exploded with rage , sm@@ ote me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , I will find you and move you down . &quot;
we need no one else !
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have the only good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of at that time I wore a jacket and a tur@@ t@@ shirt from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence had been accused of being a tra@@ dic@@ rous of this crime . I did not resist , no problem , they can put me to load what they wanted . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if one has only children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot;
it develops and recognizes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have been exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship of men . but why should the bodies disappear ? &quot;
why children kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with his mother &apos;s house , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been easy to put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people do not have families with whom one could pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that you can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re @-@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were cr@@ ushed and there - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
&quot; the idea , to show my father , arose during a conversation when he stood under house arrest . &quot;
I made him repro@@ aches because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt inner dead and asked me what the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; which they allegedly def@@ ended , actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something about me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed a terrible crime and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Well , then forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I ref@@ unded the first ad . &quot;
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can pre@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally said against my own Father .

&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a trial was committed for crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 . those who were guilty of crimes against humanity were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court failed to pun@@ ish prison sentences and nine cases of prison sentence between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were fre@@ ed@@ oms . &quot;
eleven of the originally 54 accused died during the trial .

&quot; a translation error makes older people in Ky@@ oto to &quot; &quot; terrible car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sign of translation errors in a centre in Ky@@ oto , where you can pro@@ long your driving licence . &quot;
the photo was spread in social media .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; in the Japanese town Ky@@ oto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , in the last month witnesses a very special dis@@ liked translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign , the Japanese word corruption alleg@@ ations ( kor@@ ei@@ sha ) , which means &quot; older drivers &quot; means wron@@ g@@ ly - maybe also with b@@ Ã¶s@@ sing backgrounds &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 @-@ 20 September to electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos were dealt with in the social media .
&quot; the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the daily Ky@@ oto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n newspaper published in Ky@@ oto :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
&quot; this is an excuse for elderly people and in an international city like Ky@@ oto just un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; said Holmes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; &quot; idle drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , if gramm@@ atically not quite correct name &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture Ky@@ oto were ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a Blogger reported as follows :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt off@@ ended by inadequate correction ( translation ) , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese online intelligence service J @-@ Cast News sat down somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan , and wrote : &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an un@@ suitable description of older drivers . according to the police , the percentage of older drivers , which are involved in accidents , are quite a cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ f@@ ecture Ky@@ oto , for example , 1,9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents caused by sen@@ iors were caused by the elderly . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , Seni@@ ors 1,8@@ 03 caused a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;

&quot; in the article comments about the light , showing which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to he@@ ap against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo over the translation errors has also received the following comments :
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So faul@@ ty is the translation actually not , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and quite Asia .
the En@@ gra@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizar@@ re mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the original and active language skills in order to transfer him to the target language .
&quot; the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is in the case of native speakers . in general , the conviction that transl@@ ators should be in the target language - not in the original language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , French native speakers should translate French into French - not from French into English . &quot;
photo of Flickr Users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as a native language that could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for over@@ coming , cost reasons or relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies who do not have foreign employees , can still produce their company internally . then , the Japanese people who are best et@@ ched to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good . &quot;
photo of Flickr Users Karl Baron .
translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; this is true for some languages , especially for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious re@@ prints that often decor@@ ate t @-@ shirts or pockets , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;

translation errors may be acceptable or at least harm@@ less .
&quot; in the future , Ky@@ oto will hopefully make a more serious source for their translations in the future . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay &apos;s online channel . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer available . &quot;
&quot; other online broad@@ cast@@ ers took photos of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organised by op@@ position@@ ists who oppose Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was cut , and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# Z@@ ensu@@ r : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that the internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are re @-@ locked .
that is from the page by @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report on protests . at that time , the Commission threatened with fin@@ es and closing arguments , if they would continue to report about the demonstrations , as the Commission looked as &quot; &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I have registered myself at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
&quot; surprisingly , it is still cheaper than to buy two liters of Lim@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online transm@@ it@@ ters . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier research findings of the Institute for Presse and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , concluded that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique using the DNS server requests of certain domains er@@ ron@@ eous . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or ref@@ uses the request when calling for such a website . &quot;
&quot; the FTP port is normally located on port 21 thus this has been pre@@ filled for you already . if your web site uses another port , you will have to enter it here . &quot;
&quot; in V@@ PI@@ TV , a third @-@ locked channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera @-@ camera Elvis Fl@@ ores , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested . &quot;
&quot; Fl@@ ores was beaten , while he was in police custody . &quot;
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on broadcast again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls have become slaves to receive a training &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta child as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and coll@@ ects testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ min@@ als who were just like them victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report of short texts published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que CA@@ EN &quot; &quot; ( Sk@@ ier cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she did not eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before her studies at the university , she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one that has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she became ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , the more than 46@@ .000 boys and girls , who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers her inf@@ erior son or her inf@@ erior daughter to another , rich family . in exchange the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what does not mention is that children do not have to pay for inn@@ umer@@ able days of house work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that can not be raised within the framework of a contract . &quot;
the practice is widely used as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance through large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization devoted to the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as - above all young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ mean az@@ go - collected stuff , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call the things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as is generally not silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family that has her daughter in the belief that she can conclude her training to improve her position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of herself &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family that takes the girl takes up and whose exploitation with faith justi@@ fies that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise do not get training and maybe even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ mean az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experienced it .
&quot; in January 2016 the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the bor@@ dered of par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; as Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº in the hospital , her body showed traces of violent b@@ lows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military member Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants at 250 kilometres to the east of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra struck Fer@@ rei@@ ra with a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n until they suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; some days later , the media reported about the incident . &quot;
she stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela committed the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s death for the death of the girl .
they designated the Cri@@ a@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of sla@@ very . &quot;
&quot; several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that &quot; &quot; no more Carolina &quot; &quot; could be in Paraguay . &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the sp@@ ouse and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid examination of the case .
&quot; they want that Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for murder on the girl , which was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta , was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes from court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be the case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go in history . &quot;
the daily life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as are exploited not only as labour power , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , who worked in her father , had to log in , and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to go all work and began to sell candy on the street or on the market , to earn money . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in the capital of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , she had to share the time so that it was still time for learning . &quot;
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
&quot; Fri@@ days for example , they cleaned the refrigerator , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went home and had time for learning . &quot;
&quot; the more she was done with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but this time was limited because they had to make dinner for her employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says that she never had to hunger , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the house as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the house@@ keeper , former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings the house@@ keeper Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him to stand and read editorial from opposition newspapers , such as &quot; &quot; transmitter o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the master of the master had found someone who heard while he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not to visit my family , because they believe that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would have to speak at home again their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made , they explained . &quot;
&quot; however , she was totally clear that she had paid for everything she had received from them , with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken is bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ik@@ anas that are exposed to cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognise that someone who has no parents has a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I particularly felt that I belonged to no group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ mean az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can view job adverti@@ sements for cleaning agents and children &apos;s homes in Paraguay . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliamentary groups have recently agreed to &quot; &quot; agree on regulation concerning the use and usage of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is adopted by parliament , users and users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , then a place would be set up in order to provide citizens with permission to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , users and users would have to register with their right names and identity numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it failed to do this , it could be a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a bu@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six paragraphs and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video editing and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law will be en@@ du@@ red when it is assumed , as the draft does not have an indication of how the Egyptian authorities can impose the benefit of the users and users . it is un@@ clear that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliam@@ ent@@ arians and sponsors of the legisl@@ ature , told the Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry , blocking the fire@@ wall , blocking the Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for Egyp@@ tians and Egyp@@ tians to submit information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conducting research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt with regard to things related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that as they control the physical and physical public and private rooms it could be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , it means that they will be able to set up a strong monitoring system to remove citizens who request a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to lead them to a court . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Legisl@@ ative Parliament and the constitutional committees before it goes into the plen@@ ary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and implementation will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in accordance with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no diver@@ ging nar@@ ration on the image area is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the parliament ordered Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ hr@@ y against cy@@ ber crime , in which a lifel@@ ong prison sentence for those intended to be found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest &quot; protest . &quot;

&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards that lie through Africa and Asia are among the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ icol@@ or ) . in total there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Con@@ servation of Nature . &quot;
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ory in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem , and the health and memory of the ecos@@ ystem depends on the fact that a large beast of prey is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the free wilderness is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video is therefore determined that they have a large cat in the camera trap , Raz@@ a breaks in pure pleasure . &quot;

&quot; in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , announced the progress made in the last six years to re@@ build the life of those who were affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a violent earthqu@@ akes , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had caused disaster . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the Mi@@ y@@ agi pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ agi and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had to disappear whole coastal towns from the map . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced an atomic accident . &quot;

the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by disaster , have opened their doors until December 2016 , which is almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of the ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ agi are now in operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have been res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident have attracted large @-@ scale farming in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of ag@@ r@@ arian land .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ agi could recover 93 per cent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of land land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hima , lie in the nuclear barrier zone . &quot;

how it is for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to experience the huge earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , disa@@ strous astro@@ ph@@ es , nuclear accidents that Japan had to experience . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were installed in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement homes . &quot;
&quot; according to the state of 2017 , more than 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima are still living outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation areas are the most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation areas , older than 50 years old . they are known to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ agi , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo . &quot;

&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 has been delivered to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer was struck by a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;

his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly within a few days rapidly in Brazil . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures it is also the face of the police officer , who attack with a hammer . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police were known in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was insp@@ ected by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive station , his face would be six months in television and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activist from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia divided the video on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several hospitals shortly afterwards . &quot;

&quot; in the past , Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;

&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus in fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing . &quot;

matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Skills Short@@ age and Over@@ education
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories developed the doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of that there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
&quot; after the harvest , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants until only the framework of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to find themselves new .
some changed the work .
others re@@ signed and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still lean .
&quot; a soldier veter@@ an , who faces every day at 4 : 00 am , is not screw@@ ed by the crisis in the sugar cane industry . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which have been in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
&quot; n@@ ene reminds you that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ I would be preserved the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry resi@@ des the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administration decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the country some decades ago , but the bad crops have no more news . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway station of the municipality saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsol@@ ete , and hardly competitive were un@@ acceptable to the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they only left the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 03 Euro ) .
matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Skills Short@@ age and Over@@ education
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
&quot; however , the sugar price rose to about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s will remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published on the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the present production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will enter into history , &quot; which were the first words of the Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
&quot; in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for continuing education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closing of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first start , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially dismis@@ sed documents , which would only be removed with regard to the parts that would be removed , the address and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from there , the responsibility was over and the letters were more and more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the down@@ ward factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories , &quot; he as@@ sures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will at the down@@ time of the factory , where he helped them , involved . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he removed one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ station generator was eliminated .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for working places and services that were generated in the communities in which they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president saw in the eyes of the people present when he was guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane has only been extracted highly by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to ap@@ preh@@ end them , they also listened to the road to asp@@ hal@@ e , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other companies . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search for other factories . &quot;
they were to spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not once used for supplying the church . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working . &quot;

they tor@@ tured him for ten years .

&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the Kit@@ ch@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalization .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people don &apos;t always speak the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation is recorded , the chorus is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;

sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on my days on earth
&quot; this is the day when you will take our cry , &quot;
because we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will raise ourselves one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life

in Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost any restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , near the entrance hall sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( soever shall be exhibited , &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tics models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) of any food which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to producing these plastic dishes .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so usually that they don &apos;t even find them anymore . a new trend , however , turns them into con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; when Na@@ ver mat@@ ome published the Blogger @-@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ go san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic gr@@ ated cell tapes , as shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu shop house . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ ten collection objects , such as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new show in Tokyo station .
the new boom in Essen@@ ti@@ als is becoming increasingly sophisticated .
&quot; in this case , a Kais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with se@@ afood ) was transformed into a mobile stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
also this part was made for the exhibition at Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that contains your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a guy for the mobile phone , this is a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the coma .
&quot; some mobile stand and mobile designer allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ic@@ ura or salmon @-@ che@@ ated is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership

I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also assume a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members . &quot;
our latest mobile phone support has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ les made of dried salmon . &quot;

a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the criminals and Christians regularly dip in statistics , but they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that brings this struggle to itself . &quot;
&quot; the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ el , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , anyone looks at the trau@@ ma or the communities who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each body , behind each bone , behind each bone in hundreds of secret gra@@ ves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has called the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) to give this sacrifice a voice and tells stories of people who were in the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organized crime not only makes us fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , if shops are close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore have to drive a lot of kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
the Pain of Vic@@ tims
&quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que c@@ ambi@@ an p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; how fear life changed &quot; &quot; ) tells precisely these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who seeks secret gra@@ ves every weekend . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priest : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we are preparing ourselves again on the task we have set to go , and to gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; my mother , who is also here with me . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , they have no income . &quot;
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t pay them out because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get that ?
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid of fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a les@@ bian by Animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Ta@@ x@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with disease and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for some years now .
&quot; I am coming to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the pages with pictures , which actually can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or files from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sting or sad . it seems like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
&quot; I cannot be in@@ different , or consider it as normal . &quot;
she writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year c@@ ousin think he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ic crimes &quot; &quot; when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is that , as if they have lost those who have lost someone , and those who fear that they have happened so much . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic .
&quot; the crime of man is unbeliev@@ able for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighbouring place is justified , that they were &quot; &quot; resident &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to persu@@ ade them to remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they do not stir and remain silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : like a family with threats , it describes how armed criminals month for month money from their business , until they were not only destroyed the business , but also their family apart . &quot;
you think about everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain above never falls , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , telephone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they are kidn@@ apped or killed . &quot;
&quot; I have asked myself in these terrible days if we@@ eping my deep rooted feelings , but the answer is no , for I have forgotten how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation of violence .
&quot; in the introduction , he th@@ rows questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of them .
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every age of the year .
&quot; however , they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a young for whom the whole life of violence exists and who had to learn to live . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; as Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence through organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mur@@ ders according to the laws of the Government of the United States . &quot;

these are just some of hundreds of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories still live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those who cannot forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data into life , whose objective is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking , who has tor@@ tured the country over the last four decades . &quot;

&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr Users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this contribution and the pages to which he linked , include pictures on which violence is presented . &quot;
the fact check is important at a moment in which it is about to lift a rum@@ or or expose a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the years after something the first time appeared ? content in social media , regardless of whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to cover trage@@ dies that have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this wrong coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; incorrect context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - den@@ ies not the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what is happening in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank wagon crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and exploded . 230 people came to life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country was negl@@ ected for years and has been devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of battles that were difficult to drive . &quot;
it was tragic that the tank wagon fell victim to the victims .
&quot; the government representatives described a fire ball , the d@@ us@@ ern@@ ing houses including a cinema nearby , which was full of people who were full of the football world championship . &quot;
houses were scattered and scattered cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered throughout the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur User My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Multiple photos of the event form the gray @-@ full scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows series of disgu@@ ised bodies standing on the floor while people are watching them .
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years , the same photograph was published several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but they were not attributed to these trage@@ dies in particular , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am seized the remote ni@@ geri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were buried in streets and b@@ ushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were broken , shot or burned . &quot;
only using satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated .
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ clear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ de@@ preci@@ ation ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was taken as a cover for mass demonstrations . &quot;
another step further enhances personal comments like this example fal@@ sely the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange came in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash message , the United Nations described those who were able to flee , rape , and some dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported on the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following that summari@@ zed these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to portra@@ y this information . &quot;
&quot; the original edition , which was last updated on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , the AF@@ P as their source , had also been wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to Th@@ ein being this statement , but had not been associated with the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false data
traces of these false statements are sufficient to return to the year 2011 and 2012 and actually come from everywhere all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can be crossed . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the original image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they origin@@ ate from a mixture of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have forwar@@ ded false reports , and others tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have unlimited examples of mis@@ use use and put them in connection with the respective countries , based on what page they have been published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than through the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the listed countries listed below ( which have been linked to each other ) , several examples may be used for mis@@ use . &quot;
here are some cases which can now be seen completely ( on the map in Orange ) :

La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica is quoted as his source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although not known if the original report has the picture ) .
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; according to the mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , like this here , who used the picture from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; , &quot; have seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who resi@@ sted this . &quot;

&quot; the government of Myanmar published a judge on what they perceived as &quot; deliberately f@@ ing@@ ated messages and photos , international media , international human rights organizations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings regarding Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this judgment , which appeared exclusively in English , also includes references to fake pictures of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Speech and of extrem@@ ist groups are used to explain that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and others ( which is often distributed by bur@@ ial nation@@ alists ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is the difference between the two countries ? &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) . &quot;
&quot; this post , which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly demonstrates that the picture of the DR Congo is NOT showing Muslims to kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this message side claimed wron@@ g@@ ly that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein was involved in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in killing the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;

&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities found these events , presum@@ ably in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as a cover for the mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;

frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) that draw these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence in connection with the murder of Christians by Muslims or to the defense of Muslims - the murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
&quot; a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated , compared to a European or French life . &quot;
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worthwhile to examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers can no longer have faith in these pictures . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are many people who are un@@ inten@@ tionally committed to tr@@ ash the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of mis@@ understanding and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and nar@@ rowed it the real horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the dis@@ sem@@ ination of non @-@ violent images was already deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that the rejection of pictures of a refusal is equivalent to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even required by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concern is that violent images readers and viewers are des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ zing and the ability to feel em@@ pa@@ thy ( such as this study , investigating how violent media act on it to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot about violent representations in the news media , fact is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; Techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; they will have to re@@ think about situation in which a picture suggests something , which actually can be used by the context or completely mis@@ br@@ anded kind . &quot;
&quot; however , every investigation of false accus@@ ations should also be taken into account as internationally as possible . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

&quot; a blog with the name of un@@ transl@@ atable ( e.g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) endeav@@ ours to provide language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate . &quot;
these words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these insur@@ moun@@ table words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Sob@@ re@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all conflic@@ ting stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , why a complete explanation and sometimes something context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected all over time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find example words from the V@@ oting Speech language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Take care of your parents in recognition of what has been committed to you in your younger years .
&quot; and words in the language that are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; - The comfort or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after having war@@ med up on cold days in the sun . &quot;
in Birds own words from his blog About :
&quot; they captiv@@ ate other cultures , revealing other thoughts and w@@ edge our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you can influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages . &quot;
&quot; Red@@ ner of &quot; &quot; Treasure Languages &quot; &quot; which are very appreciated by Un@@ transl@@ atable are invited to upload their favourite wines here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka re@@ acts with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka looks at the moment of the worst high water and vom@@ iting cat@@ astrophe in this decade .
&quot; in the end of May , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya have entered into 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after a statement of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people were missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud guards . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were killed in 304 safe residence . &quot;
&quot; the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water resi@@ dues in some areas went slowly back . &quot;
health and hygiene ratio of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the scale of the flood disaster :

&quot; today morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was standing in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded due to the water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and other five will be completed for transport of emergency deliveries to the residents in their floo@@ ded villages .
several organizations and startups have also proved to be able to help .
Facebook sites like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
&quot; for those who want to donate dry food and food @-@ necessary goods for flood victims , &quot;
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this field .
the Ta@@ x@@ ir@@ u@@ f app Pic@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the cat@@ ast@@ omet@@ ry is informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical tree Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; key that allowed users to call a vehicle for pick @-@ up assistance and donations . these were then forwar@@ ded to the Red Cross for free . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they led a &quot; SOS &quot; key that had more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue campaigns for floo@@ ds and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri L@@ ank@@ as , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , residents in need of security and help aid measures . &quot;

&quot; using authorized _ Dam@@ als in January , I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with an neighb@@ oured and loving friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts her children ; she is my rock in fire . &quot;
&quot; in one minute , we call on slo@@ gans for the rights of women . &quot;

&quot; we are in a sea of rain@@ falls and people , some keep the i@@ con@@ ian image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from a American flag , others , slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my friend looked at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lima ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar , who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; that have built themselves in their imagination . &quot;
they educ@@ ate me .
there is 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be Muslim , in different ways , but somehow we are put all into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit there , will be em@@ belli@@ shed . &quot;

I don &apos;t stand alone .
&quot; this is even the poet , whose poetry in America is most sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which pictures come in a sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western imagination , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist pictures of Muslims who have been colon@@ ized by Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman that you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid disman@@ tled the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures still stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood will continue to con@@ quer them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I saw how this powerful , fla@@ w@@ less n@@ arr@@ ative of our news@@ feeds is dominant . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ shadow the reality , which has led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the United States did not even choose their first female presidential candidates . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying out their head@@ scarf in public buildings and to cover sau@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which are both two sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group practi@@ ses its &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong nar@@ rati@@ ves weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
it sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers who were killed with sla@@ very ships .
it delet@@ es the existence of Qu@@ eer @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v made our collective imagination so deep and er@@ ron@@ eous , that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children become the goal of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and sc@@ rut@@ iny . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell , and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we are doing more than just stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create n@@ arr@@ ative which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed , where seven million Muslims have the highest degree of &quot; various &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
&quot; more than one third of the entire Muslim population , African @-@ Americans are African @-@ Americans . &quot;

&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ ist mask with money , think tanks and experts for fal@@ seh@@ ood , which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is . or what Islam is , has manipul@@ ated . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as Mus@@ lima , but a Mus@@ lima was only born in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provis@@ ional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be seen , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend would see my neighbour , my neighb@@ ors , my rock in the fire that I could see Mus@@ lima if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I wi@@ dened her in my arms and her Arab verses to protect the Qur &apos;an and called Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them repeat three times .
&quot; please therefore , that it is protected from evil , evil that you can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith is probably not always visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my sh@@ ading . &quot;

&quot; it is the picture of her that I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings of Su@@ fi saint , and a cor@@ an with a lot of book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters , which she can hardly imagine . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lima means to speak the prayers that she said to me , if I have a bad day . &quot;
God Mi@@ an what God means is my only Lord .
&quot; for a people who have been colon@@ ized over centuries by a &quot; Empire &quot; which has formed a company with the name of Hon@@ worthy British Ost@@ ini@@ dia Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God to my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; affili@@ ation means to grow up and to hear that men are not crying , but at the same time see that my grandfather is we@@ eping . &quot;
&quot; in between , while he writes books about the modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an we@@ pt for his family in the village of K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , their families , as with my grandfather , of col@@ oni@@ alists , who have dealt with the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
&quot; to be a Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have been colon@@ ized all to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first fly bomb of history was rejected by a century over a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir cap@@ tan of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he travel@@ ed into more parts of the world than I had ever been and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means to remember that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military of the world , with troops that were disper@@ sed over every continent , apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , were disper@@ sed in Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy will pun@@ ish the US and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story of four times is reported as a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four@@ teen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago a African Islamic named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; an American woman , a Pakist@@ an@@ or , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Mus@@ lima and a journalist , means that the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple tie @-@ ups , but to fail to communicate it to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion ent@@ ails more possibilities than a magic cube , but it is represented in the reduced branches &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care about my child , and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that power@@ full and privileged people will establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this branch . &quot;

but I am concerned because of this difficult global time point where we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason for the conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House . &quot;
they are exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by providing the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years before , they had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the story that I was not aware of , as I was as old as it now is my daughter , but who made me today to an un@@ circum@@ sp@@ ired Mus@@ lima . &quot;
things I left here like a bread @-@ cr@@ ust in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity do , like a story , where someone has made a &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , on the other side of the bridge in Ber@@ kel@@ ey , conversations within the 8th Jubil@@ ee conference are held to Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why tell me this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars can be led and people through the creation of the &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; in public opinion , had been science of Stan@@ ford for four decades . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously the &quot; others &quot; to soli@@ di@@ fy , as it did my friend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have had no pre@@ sidents , the chocolate cake , while he already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; &quot; to others &quot; , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .

&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written but spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been running events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages can not be passed on to those born babies born . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities , accept diversity - safe spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to . &quot;
&quot; during &quot; &quot; listening to often &quot; , &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; listen to appreciate , to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this format , history tells stories of history first in their own language and translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not professional story@@ t@@ eller , their devot@@ ion and their presentation will lead to the audience . &quot;
&quot; they cry out laughter and emotions , when the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the D@@ af@@ ing language . during this turn , the story@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art for their country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ lon@@ ara tells the f@@ ables from the h@@ asen and the Pavi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after having explained the meaning of his f@@ ables , John Ny@@ lon@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a broad grin he shares his sense of inclusive : &quot;
you have heard !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treasure Language story@@ telling has taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own story@@ telling . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing since a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture held in Berlin , devoted an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , Managing Director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective follow @-@ up ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , published in the last year and is licensed here , contains a number of attachments that deal with the free culture in the face of suppression . &quot;
it &apos;s a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it is : &quot;
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real costs are connected with which this is connected .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on page to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create a sense of our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was cancelled from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or place of residence . &quot;
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for its participation in a free culture , many of us have started to think about their own destiny , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here ?
what do we have chosen ?
what have we given up to extreme beliefs in this process ?
the web developer for open source and digital activities has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from A@@ dra @-@ prison , a non @-@ military establishment to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el was based on a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the Military Court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and put them aware of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown but remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a decisive role in expanding access to the Internet and to expand the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Allen , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently crossing the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , the Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bass@@ els &apos;s cultural prot@@ otypes was predic@@ t@@ ably the work he began with a group of ar@@ che@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations and mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el did not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything to do this architecture , not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this stri@@ pping into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be in@@ valuable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; however , Bass@@ el could not close this project until now . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom , and I taught me to embrace them . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el brought me English , even when he was in prison . &quot;
I learned to read and speak English .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he taught others to read and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically without being in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a pro@@ stitute who wrote her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in prison . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for a year .
&quot; she s@@ wore the texts to him when she visited him , and he translated them out of the Arabian to English . &quot;
the book is licensed free of charge .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , &quot;

Bass@@ els Story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , the Syrian network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for human rights ) has disappeared more than 65@@ .000 people . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested or were arrested by the regime , were tor@@ tured or executed under force . &quot;
&quot; according to the International Human Rights Organisation , Amnesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in prison since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we must do this for the last time .

&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ que responded with anger on a corruption case , in which a member of government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence in which the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is about Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants due to im@@ balance between 54 million francs ( about 800 000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , the Council of Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and promp@@ tly asked his re @-@ setting to the company what happened on 19 April .
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the General Attorney General of the Republic , which did not evaluate the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za again , as the company had no discipline of discipline after his arrest . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants are not good . &quot;
&quot; the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integrated P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short CIP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency was condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle . &quot;
&quot; in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step towards the efforts of our legal system , such as the CIP . &quot;
what we are aware is that the company should have a discipline of discipl@@ in@@ arity against the dis@@ soci@@ ation .
&quot; however , the company seems to have no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ que social media , does not reject this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; contradic@@ tory &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and of which half was lowered . &quot;
&quot; he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to re@@ integrate into the company he helped him harm . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence . &quot;

&quot; bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ans and Student of Political Science in Brazil says , the director is no moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state , because he ins@@ ult@@ ed it , I cannot believe that one is rewarded in such a way that the state already ins@@ ult@@ ed so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality back and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served itself on the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state , as hand@@ ele it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself , this man has become tired , who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;

&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he was vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is to be able to sell his own individual interest , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , an ambitious man is crimin@@ ally . &quot;

America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; the bur@@ ial word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or sp@@ ines . &quot;

&quot; although about the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adj@@ ective &quot; &quot; indi@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely ambig@@ uous con@@ not@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; usually may be associated with racism , but the word does not appeal to an automatic hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts concerning his use , have been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ ma words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair on Bur@@ mes@@ an is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( Sp@@ age b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends on a spiritual way if they knew how he could re@@ lie@@ ve his back pain by making a word game . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; He@@ aling &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that they will reduce hate speech radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before it all proceeds to spread racism . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on faces .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyse the post carefully and check it by checking the words below .
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( Sp@@ age b@@ ushes ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these dre@@ ad@@ ful nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a quite good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ c@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action is a strong signal to everyone who is sending hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not be maintained long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that cens@@ orship is often a cat and mouse game , whereby users social networks are simply beginning to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot;
... &quot; when I was atten@@ tive to this new directive by Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;

Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed who has nothing to do with hate speech :
&quot; post by wer@@ ner &quot; February 22nd , 2010 , 1 : 19 pm &quot;
&quot; in the post , the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook will have more to do before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ mes@@ an Internet community to ask advice : &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
such words can be cens@@ ored even more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support , and so words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Erb@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they discovered that they have made mistakes , they did not attempt to recti@@ fy the fal@@ si@@ fied posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , they would have a great sales , that would be great . &quot;

&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make funny and write funny and write the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ posts , which contain no hate language , but nevertheless removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the bur@@ ial text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry and watch an Indian movie .
&quot; just to try out if Facebook is removed from the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to increase their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Hass@@ elt should also hei@@ ghten violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands of escape . &quot;

&quot; but rather than simply cens@@ ored the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to read more in context than code @-@ based initiatives and learned from them . &quot;

&quot; in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , it is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago . &quot;
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously decided unanim@@ ously to allow this practice to prevent this practice , so that the holy age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the leaders of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state should not interv@@ ene , since that , age does not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Child Rights Convention , the min@@ ors of less than 18 years under 18 years . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that in 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed at creating laws for children , followed by the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly they helped to bring this result . &quot;
Â© Warner Bros@@ . Entertainment Inc .
&quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to say the critics of the children before they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and sometimes doubts about whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of 2017 , the draft bill was decided against the children before - despite 4 broad@@ cast@@ ers ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent that contained itself - so that it could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make it a law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must agree and declare the law .

&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child labour was made in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 voices , and none of them were decided . &quot;
&quot; after having decided previously in the Senate , the draft can now become the law . &quot;

&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary od@@ our that has wear the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the child before is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson &apos;s opinion was , it was definitely long enough to finish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; &lt; div &gt; Zin@@ hle &apos;s boyfriend , Br@@ end@@ on Nai@@ doo wrote a beautiful tribute to his &quot; &quot; Mrs Bond &quot; &quot; on Instagram and it gave us all the feels weiterlesen ... &lt; / div &gt; &quot;

&quot; the draft for the change of the sp@@ ouse was approved today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;

&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ at@@ an Dh@@ arma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; before months Mah@@ ar@@ aj has declared his intention to take court steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to dis@@ appro@@ ve his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the Attorney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supporters of the law , it was quite right , if Mah@@ ar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most of the social media users wanted , the debate would be different . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear guest , if we say instead of talking to the discussion so generally , in a way that only panic and arro@@ gan@@ ce can provo@@ ke when we talk to the state in our bedroom , &quot; simply talk about that the state , our daughters to protect them , may be mis@@ used by large , stub@@ born men who are in their advantage , would you be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that it is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law , or not , these legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm , although there are laws that they are prohibited . &quot;

&quot; for more than a month , Turkey has now blocked the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
day for day becomes clear@@ er how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ ade .
&quot; although many techniques @-@ sealed Internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked websites ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has since 2008 article by Wikipedia as recently published in a published report of the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet since 2007 have been passed since the Internet Act ( Nr. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , several M@@ irr@@ or@@ pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia are mirr@@ ored and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform dep@@ lo@@ ys all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;

&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts : &quot;
&quot; after we heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed way . &quot;

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
&quot; a beautiful N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ urred with poor@@ ly positioned motifs and well @-@ washed colours . &quot;
this motiv@@ ates him to carry a camera at himself and try to engra@@ ve the situation .
&quot; at that time , he was still a child . &quot;
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar will endeav@@ our to bring Nep@@ an animal world to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ et@@ own right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nept@@ une &apos;s animal world . &quot;
he described his first @-@ class position in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage site . what could better be better for a passionate game photographer ! ! &quot;
he had called a call from my father to get a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the Leop@@ ard was and I started to kne@@ ad pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as fur@@ ious as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he arose from face to face to face : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b the mind of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he immediately turns away , we see us and he star@@ es through the S@@ al trees ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , its passion for promoting Nep@@ als nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and lived mostly in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger , and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation . &quot;
see below some of these photos below .

&quot; years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands &quot;

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ aa@@ z K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community of media from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid the greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women that they should respect the husband due to social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should prescri@@ be the norm . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by an apparent court and accused of her family and the village community after she had addressed a married family with name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives is not common in the name , is also common among men . however , they have much less allow@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not come back to this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus quickly become the main topic of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the au@@ spices of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that are in 13 Indian states , he is part of the Campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and uses for the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has worked for seven years with help of their video camera on the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s homes to exile from HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and guides these clubs . &quot;
she reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them to amb@@ ass@@ adors of the wall .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini presented in her discussion round , acted by women who don &apos;t name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she has decided for this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
&quot; the names of their hus@@ bands do not speak lou@@ dly , is a spectac@@ le that they all ought to be maintained and never questioned . &quot;
comments : not Com@@ mented
this tradition shows that a woman is respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not hold this , is regarded as a hind@@ ran@@ ce , as a woman without morality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion round .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never known her husband , had never been named the name , at home , as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband stayed long after the video was at the end .
&quot; my husband , my husband , turned to me , and said , I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; . &quot; some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , were protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the lap , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , it means that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it be equivalent to it ?
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which she brought the name of their hus@@ bands over the lips , &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra on the Bre@@ chen of a century @-@ old tradition , in the married women who never speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she only sat down during the whole exercise , another decided to let the whole an@@ ew fru@@ stration of him and his family , leaving him cur@@ sed . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in ad@@ ren@@ aline , with an ancient spectac@@ le , women decided that they would actually try to call home their hus@@ bands in their name . &quot;
and they held their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in the head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop his name .
another club member decided to do it for dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said she was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understand@@ able and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the foreh@@ ead , showing the sp@@ ouse : &quot;
why do women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he would do it . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I listened to him .
&quot; the other women have not totally ceased , but they think they are now in a better position , even to choose him not to wear him in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at any discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to make sure that women take care of what could hear , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last few months she celebrated her own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things that they had never done before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years now , but I also have some things , for example , how our identi@@ ties are made to our hus@@ bands , never so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say something loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have been wearing sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most of us this is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ man Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a trousers , wear it ; they did not we@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of contro@@ versy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , the mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , the Roh@@ ini gave their own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( upper hem@@ isph@@ ere ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will be able to create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months since her first discussion club has changed somewhat , Roh@@ ini confirms that things come slowly into the rolls : &quot;
we &apos;ve only done little steps so far .
&quot; some women tried a couple of times , but then they listened to the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do not make it yet , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two will continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women wear zinc red on their foreh@@ ead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the f@@ elling of more freedom of movement or the own dress code - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how raw ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
&quot; and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , if every woman goes home at home and other people who talk about what we are talking about and what we do . &quot;
we all sit in the same boat .

&quot; photo : unlike Bol@@ in / Flickr , CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of people for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for super@@ sti@@ tion purposes , distur@@ bs the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government has now called a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from border to Mal@@ awi . &quot;
&quot; one of the victims was found , and part of the organs were taken from . &quot;
two men were arrested and in the episode they stood for the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Mal@@ awi .
&quot; the local super@@ sti@@ tion will give the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a Gl@@ atz@@ kÃ¶@@ ping man may reveal gold or wealth , explained the police spokes@@ person of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
&quot; another group , the aim of assass@@ inations for ob@@ liter@@ ate purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; in the South African country , this led to a mission to investigate this practice . &quot;
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring countries Tanzania , where the government has developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ uto .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que are the aim of ritual attacks , the mos@@ aic police warn of the latest murder of three Gl@@ atz@@ kÃ¶@@ ping men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the assass@@ inations took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that the local police have already been following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the people of the people .
&quot; the persecution and murder of Gl@@ atz@@ kÃ¶@@ p@@ ected individuals for the extraction and the sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , for probably super@@ sti@@ tious ritu@@ als , has also been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , this draws the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men were killed with hair loss problems in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared the chron@@ icle of the blogger poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who pointed out that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty posed by Moz@@ ambi@@ que : &quot;
&quot; I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE ON MO@@ UL@@ BI@@ K , THE S@@ ICH is ash@@ amed of a country where people would have sh@@ am to go on the road , and they would not viol@@ ate sex against good marks , work and other services , a nation where people would be ash@@ amed or even their lives in order to make their bread , a country where neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or &quot; &quot; black magic &quot; &quot; are hun@@ ted to get into fast wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for a wireless hum@@ our could not be missed . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambi@@ que and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the District of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange , as well as the police spokesman Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , both gl@@ atz@@ ers are : &quot;

&quot; a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably recently made . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the deta@@ ined Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention to the international community , after his lawyer ended at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end of June . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years of imprisonment for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after he was involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which demands democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has described the case as &quot; &quot; an internal issue &quot; &quot; and a spokesman said he did not notice it as &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China is still receiving calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , allowing him to release a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from foreign countries .
United Nations United Nations
&quot; in the end of June China , Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Li@@ u abroad a treatment . &quot;
Norway ( 1 )
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Affairs B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway was given to the Sto@@ cks after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government ha@@ sten@@ ed that this ultimately failed to do with the decision . &quot;
the diplomatic relations were once again continued in December last year .
&quot; after the message had been spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his detention , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was called to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance , where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for the release of Li@@ us on how it was in an explanation on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
they should meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans would expect him to have the possibility of treatment abroad , so far as it would help him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman in the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 , announced that the emb@@ assy of the Chinese authorities could not only release Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the US emb@@ assy attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Foreign Ministry , that &quot; no country has the right to take into consideration and make ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the following couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to medical care of his choice , which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

Germany Law Articles in English
&quot; the German government spokes@@ person Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping was published on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
&quot; according to diplomatic sources in Beijing , the news agency reported that China had large concerns whether the vort@@ ex could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;

&quot; in an explanation on 29 June , France &apos;s Ministry of Interior also called on to release Li@@ u from humanitarian grounds : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments he , regardless where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family will have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news announ@@ cing France info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information about whether France would take it in the end . &quot;

&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dal@@ ai Lama , showed himself very worried about the 28 June by Li@@ u and gave that many of him asked him to pray for li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives which he took , and for which he had been strictly punished , had led to a more harmonious , more stable and well @-@ being in China , which again contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moving and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ ov , Singapore should be considered as a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the minister noticed that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he support that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , whereby most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to turn the logic to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable country , we can say that we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , what country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons were not very no@@ isy : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal lands &apos; , in view of his , he appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as you reach the core point of the topic , the good old Lei@@ er from the author@@ it@@ arian rulers , who pre@@ tend to be demo@@ crats , leave the twisted logic because it fits better to its power . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the last week of Sh@@ an@@ che the answers to his American guests with regard to our press , our Judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really didn &apos;t answer . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact us . &quot;
Rachel Z@@ eng ur@@ ges Sh@@ an@@ ach to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very thank@@ ful if our last K Sh@@ an@@ che would take the effort to clarify this point if he was highly paid to be part of the Government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; when An@@ on published his comment on the blog , he points out about the critics that you should start reading the full text of the conference so that you can understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ che , according to which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the heading .
&quot; as he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ comfortable even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
&quot; he ple@@ aded Singapore with cities in the US , and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) . &quot;
&quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; be no country , &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; at the same time , however , this is not the case . &quot;
&quot; I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said , very embarrass@@ ing ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what awaits me - be I with them or not , but this is another matter . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ sh@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it correctly and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; the TYPO3 community , contribut@@ ors , and the release team prepared a new snap@@ shot of the current development of TYPO3 CMS 6.2 : bet@@ a@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ ch has committed a mistake &quot; &quot; a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a fre@@ aky representative ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country is the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ ov are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the Singap@@ or@@ alists do their military service , but they only defend their city , but not their country ? &quot;
whom must our prime minister have to pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel statement ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; journey of a Dec@@ ade to the affir@@ mation , Singapore and was always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many Singap@@ or@@ alists ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; the defense of the country , above all , &quot; &quot; but this is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understand@@ able aspect of your home or home country ?
&quot; their answers will be published here as part of a ongoing series , showing rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world and will be shown another fac@@ et . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is most asked in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , I answer . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his talk by talking about personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard responsibilities : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag at their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; on the other hand , Americans ... . &quot;
&quot; when I was 20 years ago , I began to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ pers on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighb@@ ors .
we have a free health care !
with us there are no weapons !
same sex marri@@ ages are legally legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; we say obviously very often &quot; &quot; excuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is suppos@@ edly regarded as the most toler@@ ant country over ethnic groups .
we are not as these types in the south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends I admire . &quot;
&quot; it would not make me up to me , if one would change me for example with Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first : as &quot; nice &quot; means to be sp@@ y - like the gut@@ ted , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders out of &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada truly a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
it is harm@@ less to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to earn .
&quot; this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone , a major part of the Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what outside as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t talk about the fence across the fence .
&quot; we are missing the warm , open @-@ heart@@ ed kindness , which I connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Justin Tru@@ deau looked on stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy . &quot;
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a music video that par@@ o@@ ds the Jun@@ ta , to restore the power , and to restore the civilian government despite its promises , continues to reg@@ ain the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) , the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what rules his girlfriend makes . &quot;
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video refers to the continued military domination of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
IPTC : caption Billy Talent live at the Greenfield Festival in Interlaken ( Switzerland ) on June 13th 2009 . IPTC : copyright Notice Copyright by Shelley Jambresic .
the video for the song was a giant success .
&quot; only within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook uploaded 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists prevented the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these recordings of the videos , which refer to some of the political themes that Thailand has insi@@ sted in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 Rules of the Girl &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provis@@ ional Constitution , which gives the upper inf@@ alli@@ bility of an absolute decision on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program to &quot; Change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are seen by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit has been set up in the army , monitors online content and people who are accused of having off@@ ended the mon@@ archy , prosec@@ uted and prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand establish@@ es a stri@@ k@@ ened presence against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ ority Affairs ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
&quot; two days later , it came to a coup of the army . &quot;
&quot; one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to buy is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warn them that the purchase is un@@ necessarily and a waste of tax assets . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people will be thrown into a black delivery van before entering into an interval camp , another problem case . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sitting in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the mon@@ archy . &quot;

&quot; the following article written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC media and published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only recovered very slowly in East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now more than 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ch@@ illing war has been officially termin@@ ated , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern subur@@ b in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the cab@@ b@@ age of Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ en . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , de@@ ca@@ ying , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in the area in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , the biggest part of Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ y@@ asi@@ en .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district of 16@@ ,000 people had barely increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , approximately 43@@ .000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; the empty five @-@ storey housing blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , the Chr@@ y@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ kow@@ ka , symboli@@ ses the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are f@@ ished and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elderly man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult to stop this .
this is a result of the war .
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous .
&quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot;
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only pav@@ ed street with infl@@ atable spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
&quot; the people who once lived in this place and their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have now left the district . &quot;
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , approximately fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks like . &quot;
&quot; the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ka &apos;s , which is still one or two families , one recognizes the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately draw back . &quot;
&quot; our mother has allowed us to take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it is simply forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers to her friend something and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the subsi@@ stence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for its own needs ) such as livestock , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the l@@ aps .
&quot; in winter , the district administration supplies candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini &quot;
&quot; ten years ago , an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; in spite of her oldest daughter , she lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ y@@ asi@@ en to live with her . &quot; &quot; my heart will always remain in Ab@@ y@@ asi@@ en , &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and ins@@ ist that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it &apos;s very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
T@@ ante G@@ alya tells us that they and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
&quot; every day , they remembered the village life before the war . &quot;
&quot; despite the relatives , who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ y@@ asi@@ en simply went away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants , Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old mex@@ ican girl , a small woman with a kor@@ all @-@ pink glasses and gold colored ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy B@@ ears form . &quot;
&quot; she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ le@@ z Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many under the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on the journey .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , br@@ ittle walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
&quot; in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage . &quot;
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hawai@@ ian migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , tells the people in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast begin to cry : &quot; &quot; mom Africa ! &quot;
&quot; where are you mom Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the time it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have even slept outside on cardboard boxes . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anybody .
&quot; they also help them and bring them to hospital if they are sick , they buy drugs that they cannot pay , they mass@@ acre them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived at a short time . &quot;
I asked him if mom Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ king ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ le@@ z Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
Foto : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very well here .
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston in order to revi@@ ve her husband and the three children .
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans are already speaking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil in advance in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey into the United States . &quot;
he has been guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; mom Africa is our mother and we can never go back , &quot; he answers . &quot; we will always remain in contact . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells us that their guests often send text messages when they are gone to gr@@ ind them or to report on the course of their journey .
it explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here but it is not the only spark@@ s for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family were included in their small house . &quot;
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he started to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered to them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking spot outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he said . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . this is the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he became a member of the United States after a raid on his work site . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;

back in the house of Mama Africa is everything again full of guests .

&quot; a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;

&quot; like a proud grand@@ mother , she feeds in her album with numerous photos . &quot;

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users brilli@@ antly summari@@ zes myst@@ erium â ... is defined by
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a Spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July , the mobile operator in Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which she points the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web purification &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is said that the app &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities will also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had just installed the app , having received messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;

J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Tel@@ ecom .
&quot; main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , online fraud , tro@@ phi@@ es and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; of course , an app with these functions can naturally be used in many ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote &quot; state actors or even hack@@ ers can manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal from it . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China are mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often m@@ ist for those who live in distant , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities frequently arrange extreme cases and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet de@@ bug@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter based media outlet &quot; Images from Main@@ land China , &quot; the cens@@ ored messages posted in China , showed photos from a check@@ point , at the polic@@ emen the residents were checked whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
notify me of follow @-@ up comments by email . notify me of new posts by email .
&quot; if you are discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be deta@@ ined up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are meant for older people .
this is a form of cap@@ tivity by The wake @-@ up technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; ( Dalmatien Central Publishing Houses ) also published a j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can raise the password requirement for a Windows operating system and thus receives unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and the party related institutions including universities and research institutes are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report of Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities released their personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard disks , lap@@ tops and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy terrorist videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality right of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pun@@ ish@@ ments for a number of other possible confusion , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activity Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at and imagine that you &apos;re totally alone in a place where everything is missing . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually resolved and revealed a truth , clearly recogni@@ zable , both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes her name all glory .
one who has hit a list of feelings and expressions that don &apos;t allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality comes back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the play , the beautiful scenes and the actors - turn the characters in essence of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when the earth turns on on the axis of the un@@ hei@@ r . it becomes clear that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but it wasn &apos;t enough so that I was &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the chief of the security forces formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he was able to prove his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn out during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; sh@@ uts down the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all the districts were cov@@ eted , only my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , it was still un@@ ra@@ ining , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t put any high demands on a city , which until the ar@@ tery with state safety organisms and their accompli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down after the power supply was stopped in the neighborhood . &quot;
I break the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice heard through the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me , and we invited us to a glorious image that filled my expectations fully and completely fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you liber@@ ate the Spirit from the lamp , but you &apos;re not interested in the smell . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet in the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; then I learned : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you have taken it all the way to the office of the security service from the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , my father was there , as I was now . &quot;
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to say : &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , or you are only brave enough if we are not near . &quot;
his ugly eyes set up on me .
&quot; and you know what to look for me in the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , van@@ ity , perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure when I replied , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , but I don &apos;t regret the word of what I have said . &quot;
&quot; it is in a single , and his father equal to it . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed set lies in me until today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a psychological torture that I was exposed to months . &quot;
I pass through the courtyard .
&quot; in the first office I let everything back , what I wear with me . &quot;
&quot; after that , through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a gang to the individual cells . &quot;
&quot; I remember all details exactly , before I enter the room . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , they have allocated a larger cell to me this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share them with only one other prisoner , and must immediately put me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the Beam@@ line left the cell , and I went back to a well @-@ tried communication method : with the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; Er@@ sth@@ Ã¤@@ ft@@ ling &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he answered me . &quot;
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells , in none of the surrounding cells was a respected man of middle ages , who looks like me and called &quot; &quot; Doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , there are no mark@@ ings known to me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; perhaps someone , whose voice is like my sounds ? &quot;
all answers regard its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had in@@ sured me , they would leave him if I remain . &quot;
LÃ¼@@ g@@ ner .
&quot; I would like to have a bird spi@@ der to sell all these crow@@ s , who lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I hear them still &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 am in the evening , always in order to hear the cry , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black was the color of the decay , until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; play on 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to hear .
&quot; in this way , the secret was ventil@@ ated : to protect the state security from us and to prevent the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al income card and betra@@ yed the close eye of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , here is no country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I attended the hearing room and meet in Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stub@@ born man , at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that gli@@ des him : &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you are still young , you can do so much more important with your life than to join you and to protest demonstrations that will soon find an end anyway . &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; I have used it to me , not to answer . &quot;
I can really no longer tell exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool for me .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to be punished , although I did nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
a punishment in all of its diversity .
his command is to get so much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; &quot; con@@ fession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which is probably from the clo@@ aking .
your hen sm@@ iled to your cri@@ es .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot keep your cry back . &quot;
&quot; my cry was not enough for him , why they exchanged the pipe by a cable . &quot;
&quot; in my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a refuse collector or whether it belonged to normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inside each other , around us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour , three of them altern@@ ated from them , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body , and also my voice , why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the Hen@@ ker noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t find a favor , why he was an electrically charged stick . &quot;
&quot; electricity flowing through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the floor , was the perfect power ladder . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had met his duty for this night .
that must have been around midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again , say , that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; a few hours passed , which came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call for morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , as@@ sh@@ ti@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an in@@ exhaus@@ tible youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry about terrible wor@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; be silent , and turn away , you will be re@@ laid . &quot;
that was new .
&quot; otherwise , they had always been released . &quot;
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoke a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b brings the majority of his time inside ; sometimes he sli@@ pped to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine spot@@ ted lips .
&quot; he lives in the upper@@ most floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ b family had been forced to escape from her village in Palestine , where she lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activist for six years , who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and questioned its proven opinion on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression through art and rap@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often uses themes like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also demands the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by limits , and he can feel his own statement with the people who have suffering from the disa@@ strous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not grant it openly , he enjoys a special tendency toward U.S. foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as &quot; &quot; Palestinian P@@ oultry of the Second Generation &quot; &quot; - so he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own living conditions , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds , &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; &quot; while he sh@@ ook in water sol@@ sten N@@ esc@@ af@@ Ã© in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is fores@@ een for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ an law also states that the consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ sel@@ ess would have little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the b@@ lows are warm coffee and the ra@@ kes of the Kent cigar@@ ette in the nose first of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when one th@@ rows a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - how to drink water in the public during Ram@@ adan - to do not land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , which contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert report . &quot;
&quot; the members and former press secretary of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN , that the concert was just cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many claim , the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous ac@@ tivis@@ m that represents the established legitimacy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes throughout the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this statement should probably not be simply sei@@ zing rhet@@ oric , but in fact an increasingly apparent cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan that appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work clearly . &quot;
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned to Lei@@ be in 2016 by taking his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre @-@ marriage sex .
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly lowered unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the inn@@ umer@@ able women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who are supposed to trust .
in the past years Jordan has taken the number of &apos; honor@@ ary mor@@ de &apos; - the in@@ official out@@ ward .
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Ehren@@ mor@@ de in 2016 reached its cli@@ max ; however , Jordan has been missing the institutional infrastructure in order to support women , victims of murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law to fraud prevention from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence may be held on in@@ definite time in prison , and for their release is often a long @-@ term bureauc@@ ratic effort , as well as the guarantee of the family that the woman will not happen . &quot;

&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse is repeated often : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and every other is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - whether faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ geneity or hom@@ osexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments for equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals still have been cens@@ ored in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya to remember later that his comments from the context were torn , twisted , and his opinion were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a revised version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b ac@@ quires openly for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against hom@@ osexu@@ als does not apply to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ i , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in remembrance today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ something that should work later on behalf of pot@@ assi@@ es , in the eighth century openly write about hom@@ osexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ ani@@ er not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , has nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new , that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence . &quot;
&quot; even recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service took several former government ministers and members of the teacher &apos;s association , with the reason@@ ing that they would have expressed comments on comments on social media , which are deeply rooted in the country with deep in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs concert is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the actual challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; in Jordan , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la has been hon@@ oured for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - so it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought and inner changes . it is certain that these changes are taking place in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams , as millions of other Arabs , also , from an Arab world without interference from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dre@@ amed not only to bring his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; it is perhaps the region using music , art and literature of a real and fundamental op@@ enness - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and artificial species @-@ led demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; as far as it is , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue and consequently resist resistance . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ heads are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; it is believed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory suggests that the trol@@ leys , drums and dancing over more than one thousand years are mar@@ ched , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Emis@@ hi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to catch some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...

&quot; rarely , outer appearance and body care is as important as in this story , because they help to keep away the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoke and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are all daily . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to increasing more norm@@ als in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can make these costly hair@@ dres@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ dres@@ sers that go to the ultimate borders of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ ser &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which takes place since 2014 . &quot;
there are experts against each other to show who can see the ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os public Facebook profile ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , who are located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice a training in the hair@@ dres@@ ser that allows them to work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunities have seen dozens of young people , that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; the school offered special training workshops before the school year , and reported some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 we were the only vocational school in the community and the district , which we are very proud of because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;

the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
&quot; it is not even more important , people who feel ex@@ alted to bring aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; this question arose from the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation , and inspired them to write the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ aci@@ Ã³n ( letters to reconciliation ) . &quot;
&quot; only before short , their country was a scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government has closed a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ab@@ ew@@ an F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; in front of the colum@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ il@@ la@@ k@@ fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years , have been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and around the clock their weapons have to be integrated into the life of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society again , who had acc@@ ustom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred against gu@@ err@@ illa fighting , has to support them in their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans had to join together and to help the integration process .
&quot; and exactly this did they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages of former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society . &quot;
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter - to be handed over to personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letter to reconciliation began on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there had been Leonardo and Cris@@ tian to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this declared that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those forgotten that they need much needed . &quot;
&quot; he plane , he told his love to share his love with people who needed the most urgent need . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to build their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war on a common history of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2,000 letters were collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I &apos;ve never thought that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the town administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ art Foundation . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC arose as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of under@@ tak@@ ings of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbeliev@@ able how many different feelings can be run through just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , &quot; said the politi@@ cian Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the govern@@ or of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; as I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go into , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ gren@@ ade laun@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Bag . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they just do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; in my life , someone wrote something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; I suddenly ran to tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ g@@ ged him completely , and sat beside the gar@@ ret . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this ste@@ amer , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of hunger . &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society there outside , which is waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now , I only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the first time , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came to a discussion round . &quot;
&quot; the students were all grown up , and the F@@ ARC already reig@@ ned in secret . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have experienced how social injustice on the whole Colom@@ bian people worked out . now , where we have the opportunity to create a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; these people who had never been hearing before and didn &apos;t have a right choice , and to realize that people who have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings that were turned around through their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - also those who killed , and so much damage , can contribute something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ le@@ z , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the colum@@ bi@@ ans have been proph@@ es@@ ied that after the dis@@ arm@@ ament of peace .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it gives ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to raise up arms and protest for their rights . and that &apos;s also totally justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we from F@@ ARC now put on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology , they belong to all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , contribute to our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those who defend life as the basis of existence will be im@@ minent . &quot;
&quot; on our way , there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; hom@@ osexu@@ als and que@@ ens people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last few months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hang@@ s like a D@@ amo@@ cles about the village of LGB@@ T@@ Q is not only about the night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us what happened in the Republic .
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines in several months , after reports that have dealt with the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of que@@ ens in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , suspected que@@ ering men and arrested them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun . &quot;
you have brought a monster to the world
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; for her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she was grown , she was aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she went to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the sexual inter@@ course of her country@@ woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; from fear of her life , she moved to the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as an honor@@ ary hel@@ fer@@ in in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who put in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone , from whom I thought , he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere in the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round of my documents by the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
&quot; on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the rear seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you want to convert the family to the family ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I know only that there was a young man , no more than 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and aw@@ ak@@ ened up in the hospital .
apparently some women had to get everything and started scre@@ aming .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which nur@@ ses were you laid out - in which men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are obsol@@ ete , there is still my male name , but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
&quot; for this , I am very grateful to him . &quot;
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a k@@ au@@ kas@@ ic name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he has gone resp@@ ect@@ fully with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighb@@ ors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they asked me to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they presented absurd demands : some told me , I must prove it by going up without the streets , others wanted that I had not changed my sex , that everything was only bad excuse , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what would I have to say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people spoke once my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that is not just your family , but the entire Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she put a kn@@ it around the neck .
&quot; luckily , the neighb@@ ors and saved them . &quot;
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I went into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car stood with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 1,@@ 506 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
my human rights friend checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help , I left the country , but then something un@@ believing . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
&quot; shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought them without regi@@ stering me , without reference , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw them in the g@@ arb@@ age .
and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
you can specify it in the FTP Folder field on the Publish window .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe about , you are in security , just because you leave the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people know , in which hotel you are plug@@ ged . you even know your room number . &quot;
only to prove you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine this ? !
that was my room number .
OC Media : do you still have contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , on the inter@@ course of inter@@ course we don &apos;t speak , that is a t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
some traditional k@@ au@@ kas@@ ic elements I still bear in me .
&quot; so much I hope , this spiritual barrier can &apos;t be overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give me trouble to look like the person that she reminds me of her past - so on my male form . &quot;
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current position in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends do , those who have d@@ welt ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I have submitted a report in Washington last week .
&quot; for this , I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I was talking to someone who has spent one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told us that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he didn &apos;t shut up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; so I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by blood . &quot;
OC Media : now even gay men have been deta@@ ined in these secret pris@@ ons ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend told me , there were not many . &quot;
&quot; if , in particular , those who have no rich relatives or who have been abandoned by their relatives in order to establish Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there so that they can be present as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim that they would have attacked some village or military bases . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is it only a mut@@ ation or have you a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote somebody who was imprisoned one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard had grown .
there has been nothing new of them since then .
they simply took them .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself as these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports . we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would it not have allowed these people to sh@@ ave themselves ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and actions of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already begun in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , already before 2003 , I was already known in very Gros@@ ny when I lived there - and I never had problems . &quot;
go to the top of the page
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to bring us back to the &quot; ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations , &quot; but ultimately returned to the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were ch@@ ased ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore red@@ head jeans and short T@@ ops . &quot;
the security ministry of the sh@@ aria has never cut me just a hair .
&quot; before the Russian Theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we were never off@@ ended .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language , there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go beyond the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you often say it often to children if you make fun of sick people .
OC Media : so they simply did their eyes shut down because they believed that you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; you have never off@@ ended me , never ch@@ ased and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period hold ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister , he began to talk about morality in television . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel how people began to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; he who had previously been laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed , looked at once with Ar@@ g@@ w@@ ohn . &quot;
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time when I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic was steadily worse . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I earned not much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
&quot; in addition , I &apos;m still active as ac@@ coun@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I guide them to the hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a cent for it .
&quot; I have discovered these people myself , when I removed refuge sor@@ es . &quot;
I am Mus@@ lima and would like to help those who need help .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ chem@@ y .
&quot; so the nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same like Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no sw@@ elling of them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the Kab@@ ard@@ ins which , the Russians , also have what ; on the whole planet there are they - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s un@@ comfortable to hear something . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practi@@ sing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fa@@ sten during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
&quot; know , many think in transitions of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ash@@ amed for my body . &quot;
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m so personally I am here , but my last intimate relationship is already longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there is a strong rise in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August returned the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under anxiety among anxiety , depression , and he sow@@ ed himself for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; a video on YouTube shared the moments after he had lit himself , fest . &quot;
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide , who was caught in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights told that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing together : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless on the persecution of the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and in@@ able to nour@@ ish their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , which is a part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny its li@@ vel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; in front of a century the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi mon@@ archy took over the power and took a great effort to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the wealth@@ i@@ est and most valuable uses for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the native population gets only little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Iranian regime ref@@ uses to systematically work jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of tribes , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to destruction devast@@ ation in the region due to dr@@ y@@ ness , and local agriculture as well as fish and pal@@ ms industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ cur@@ zi @-@ adolescents rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , told that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , 55 % have completed secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ human rights activist in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become more wor@@ sen@@ ed . reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z , new ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot;
&quot; because function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab working forces , local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is depri@@ ved of access to work possibilities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their li@@ vel@@ ihood outside their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and sur@@ name names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi , because even Arab names at the workplace are not toler@@ ated , refuse to speak Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to end@@ ure , human rights activists alert the alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avo@@ idable .

the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ id Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not a feminist , many women are responding to women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ ini@@ sts - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we generally should be all fem@@ ini@@ sts .
&quot; for example , women still earn less money today despite the same education as men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation if it is about what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later in various areas of life come to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I am double and triple below .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : when I speak on skin colour , racism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in women &apos;s LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used under race isolation and discrimination , both in and outside of feminist movement , many white fem@@ ini@@ sts decide to mention fem@@ ini@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; however , however , all agree that women - all women should come together to raise their voices and sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist motiv@@ ates violence that we are exposed to black women in two times .
or above that black women and women of different ethnic groups earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with migration background often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want that all women , all men and all all men of all skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not attach myself to a movement , in whose centre the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to take into account the injus@@ tices in their thinking , which focus on gender as well as the skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere , which always has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech , &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and also I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ men@@ able and margin@@ alised being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join me , which is also absorbed by cultural appropri@@ ation of our customs and customs to advance their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program . &quot;
&quot; for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to revi@@ ve them of a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional Femin@@ ism was founded to give women from different backgrounds a home and to limit themselves from the white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release me completely and completely from femin@@ ism and to join me to the Movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which is so persistent for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever before , that we define black women according to our own ideas and go to the spheres that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ ans : rec@@ la@@ iming ( for example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can con@@ quer ourselves ) , we can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed , which constitute the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter @-@ sect@@ oral fem@@ ini@@ sts will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they have read these lines , I ask you about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradig@@ m I exist . &quot;
I will be recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither exagger@@ ated nor ignored , nor refused . &quot;
P@@ add@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations

in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost than I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells us . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country have fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the short@@ ened and revised version of the article &quot; Die Welle of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ z . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ on@@ ef@@ ru@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence wave towards women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship , some time had passed and the police said , her statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of abuse , the official ad of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez was not useful . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman passed her ad . &quot;
to break the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women have a ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also finan@@ cially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence can be reported in the prosecution authorities . &quot;

&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ le@@ z , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ Ã³n y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers available are al@@ arming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District Attorney General 9@@ 600 ads went on for domestic violence . 70 % of them went to violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 adverti@@ sements because of domestic violence in peace .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women were killed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i , only few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; &quot; on every woman who ref@@ uses in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; there are two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not an own off@@ ence , the prosecution authorities cannot document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; only until August 2016 , journalists included at least 12 cases of genocide in the country . &quot;
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , Paraguay dies every ten days a woman due to violence by men . &quot;

un@@ seen abuse and a legal system that is not under@@ taking
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , they did not want to do this , but then there was still . this should always rep@@ ent for ever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos . but for two years she wore the psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recogni@@ zable : &quot;
I never thought that I would once become victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it , I always thought that only women are going to be sub@@ mis@@ sive because they dec@@ eive themselves by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook in which they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he had ever lifted the hand toward them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse , at least , would have had a certain sympathy for it . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who was not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner had mis@@ led them . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
&quot; in Vict@@ ori@@ as , everything began with psychological abuse . &quot;
she even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ orian ads in the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner who developed to an in@@ separ@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner . &quot;

&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of abuse is a road full of resi@@ st@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in the application of the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a draft law was discussed at the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament that was known under the H@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # fÃ¼r@@ st ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ inv@@ asive ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International .
&quot; the original design of the law seems to explain and pun@@ ish fem@@ ini@@ sts to an independent criminal continu@@ ance and pun@@ ish the har@@ ter , as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the legisl@@ ature has changed in some points to also win the ME@@ Ps for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tion was likely to be banned in Paraguay and to be punished for up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original law had fores@@ een , the majority of the ( bureauc@@ ratic and economic ) process costs that have to carry out the victims of violence at present even if they just want to equi@@ p an advertisement and receive a secure accommodation . &quot;
&quot; however , Ech@@ au@@ ri argues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter @-@ human relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ think has to take place , so violence is no more than a normal one . &quot;
&quot; in view of these facts , he ow@@ es himself and contributes to the perpet@@ r@@ ators of the perpet@@ r@@ ators . &quot;
we have to rei@@ mbur@@ se so long as it is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the Law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . &quot;
the opinions about changes are going apart .
the section concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to re @-@ attack his victims .
&quot; the string of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law is regarded as a major set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper to continue attacks
&quot; this website was blocked by a decision of the Minister of Information , on the homepage of the prohibited newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the Albanian authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ an . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he is a year @-@ old prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and released before trial , but later came again . &quot;
&quot; since 1970 , Oman has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ibn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had set his father , S@@ aid ibn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ Ã©@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; in addition to his role as the only Sult@@ an , the most important leaders in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Defence , Foreign Minister , Foreign Minister of Foreign Affairs , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the regime of the Sult@@ an is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular the secret secret service , public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , including press freedom , including press freedom , blogger and other activists , in@@ timi@@ dating and imprisoned . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restri@@ ct the peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights , including activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , her closure and detention three of her editors in the last year is a hard blow for freedom of press in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , held an article entitled &quot; High ranking parties to bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; it was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officers in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a judgment in a dispute . &quot;

&quot; despite the decision of the Court to permit Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper appears to be exposed to attacks by the om@@ ic government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information received a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information Minister personally signed an additional statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three additional months , and the minister ordered another time against the decision of the Court to resume the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases , in which Oman has been viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times . &quot;
&quot; further injuries include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atine , and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , its operation . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Figure is done with his approval &quot;
&quot; medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media , but it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot;
&quot; for the need on @-@ site medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack in the offer of global health care , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are able to cover the special medical needs on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria in the poor@@ est countries of Africa have serious consequences than elsewhere , and missing investments for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research that is carried out by African scientists is helping to build own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be convey@@ ed to economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ tious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ tious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed a serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana . &quot;
&quot; as Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched himself on HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ bian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier talked about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rior RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I recently started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;

how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
&quot; RW : there are no basic research here , we only rely on solutions that have been developed elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers instead of being M@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not good in our environment , and sometimes it &apos;s even impossible to use them here . &quot;

is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to go back or move here , because financing and development chances are better in other countries . &quot;

what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not previously ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;

&quot; RW : there are already a lot of interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .

RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there are requirements for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
GV : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa from Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often there are limited speed , things to do , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines are only available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;

Frank Mort@@ on has been bred in the USA for the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ skirts , the first plant cultivated by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only driven by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question how many sal@@ ads he can get , limits . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding . &quot;
&quot; patents have not only been used for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more such patents have been registered more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ ons . due to this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environmental prot@@ ectors and experts are also responsible for food safety in the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
it is as if in a river a b@@ oulder would lie in a river around which I have to d@@ ump .
&quot; so we have to do that , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think this patents go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed more than a new salad sor@@ es because all the characteristics are already patented , so it is so good as possible and try to breed those features which he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and endeav@@ our@@ ing to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
it also has a movement connected to the United States and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source ) .
&quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red ro@@ mer@@ s@@ salad of the variety of Out@@ skirts in the greenhouse . there will be tested , if plants can be grown in space . &quot;

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name would rather sound like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted software .
&quot; it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and are therefore permanently usable for plant bree@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the initiative , briefly called O@@ SSI , U.S. bre@@ eder can make sure that others can use them freely from them . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that they do not continue to make business and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who buy seeds to breed it , and not immediately remove them - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant species . &quot;
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .

&quot; for the em@@ itted professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Madi@@ son and O@@ SSI board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seed plays a role in larger gather@@ ings such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would not try to use the latter , not only little , by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; movement is not occupied with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot;
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible .

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endanger@@ ed because the available gene pool due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , executive officer of the O@@ SSI , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suggests that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat can be patented as a salad or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are so bred that they show targeted attributes - from such , through which their taste or colour improved to such , because they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for bre@@ eder has been decl@@ ining by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is now much worse than ever before , since the changing conditions caused by climate change are much worse . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture in the United States , the company relies on the conservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts that intellectual property has other bre@@ eder units , since &quot; patents and protection of plant vari@@ etal innovation are promoting innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that can follow each step as soon as the patent has expi@@ red . &quot;
often these statements help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees that different : 20 years ago , until a patent is ab@@ sent , certainly not promoting innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for a long time to breed plants which are adapted to the changed environment conditions , one would have lost the struggle . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and it should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible to make us impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting the plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; we do not create the characteristics . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them , and as bree@@ ders , we have no idea how the plants do this . &quot;
a mystery of nature .
&quot; for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ ders in the US state Oregon and O@@ SSI board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breed a variety , also breed its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ulture believes that her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed , bred in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
&quot; my concept is very gent@@ l@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move in international markets , but smaller than such as Mon@@ san@@ to are ) , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ ders Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; Mort@@ on is also the view that bree@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding plant pat@@ ents : &quot; &quot; it looks like I can produce something new , stronger than companies that are pat@@ enting . &quot;
&quot; I need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors are selling my grades in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent for 20 years , he says . &quot;
&quot; although the USA seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept spreads rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , a &quot; Open Source &quot; seed programme . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organisation Agre@@ col is working on an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SSI obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding differ from country to country , which cannot simply be taken into account in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Committee of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conventional fertili@@ zed plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is in the governments of Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch Organisation of Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference entitled &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all over East Africa to find something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , declar@@ es that the organisation is currently a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , which should be scheduled for next year &apos;s official start @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global Alliance for the Future of Essen@@ s - a composite from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report . &quot;
&quot; in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems emphas@@ ises - a connection from the Lu@@ by of O@@ SSI hopes that it will soon be able to recognize it more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has particular attention to where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to make people clear that even more behind their food . &quot;

human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about sel@@ ections . &quot;
August published the network on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains alive despite this attack and the ver@@ dict of Egyptian law and the Constitution by the authorities , which the law actually should defend its goal , to overcome the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities have blocked 21 web pages , such as the Independent News page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar hosted by Al Jaz@@ e@@ era , because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researchers Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , there is no doubt that there is no doubt that this is not the case . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he set up in order to b@@ ypass the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On February 8 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets , &lt; 7 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
&quot; in December 2013 , Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces , while he reported on the student protests and took a video on how the police exerc@@ ised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article is mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed concern to the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ Sis@@ i ; and even if the blocking of the blog may not be meaningful for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a si@@ ege ; an arrest , an attempted murder , pre @-@ loading at national security council , the blocking blogs , as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proved that I wrote not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it for items of articles to deal with cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after they have locked it and they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ sts go through the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) off Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet service providers ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in addition , af@@ te documented the blocking of providers to allow Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) . &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ PN@@ s started . &quot;
such practice points to the intention of the government to block and filter content that could have access to the Egyptian users .
&quot; the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which they can go against these acts against these acts . &quot;
now the question : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
&quot; the Brazilian army was deployed in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ Ã³@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;

some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school shot , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer killed in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe smoke marijuana with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ he sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , navy and air@@ w@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the wave of violence reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice also called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
&quot; reports like these are all daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least , find the manager of a local newspaper . &quot;
&quot; for the detailed report on violence in Rio @-@ famous newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August the editorial , &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which it announced a new column called &quot; war in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city on the world like murder , rob@@ bery , sexual inter@@ rup@@ tions , etc . everything that happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio is called &quot; war in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative to us as journalists not to close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper throughout the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , which are controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial article , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used , atro@@ cities of the police , who only shoot and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it ?
&quot; in an article on the News Portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil argues , the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ vei@@ ra argues against the violence as &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning , such as Extra in the analysis of military interest in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and historical and self @-@ fake negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
&quot; to remember , the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital . &quot;

&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decline of violent deaths . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux sent out of one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not conform to the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also attracts serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical for a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a Zi@@ vi@@ list belongs to an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; irr@@ ored balls &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly due to the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X and the Research Institute of The Syria Institute , there are currently around a million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 , called the life of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acre of Assad has been practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these areas have been controlled by rebels outside Damascus under si@@ ege , which led people to local residents or by tunnel and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become in@@ accessible for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms are not among the conventional , planted in Syria , and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and wa@@ it@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been campaig@@ ning for three years to announce this project and expressed its relief that it is now more and more &quot; aware of the popularity . &quot; &quot;

the initiative is dependent on generators that keep temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; due to the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels made of plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ us seeds &quot; , &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; after that , they planted a small fung@@ al in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in the Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to contribute to the people of fung@@ us from different reasons : &quot; &quot; break of si@@ ege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; distribution of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by eating food ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc . ) for the extraction of new food . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege are visible . &quot;
we want our experiences inspired people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

&quot; two and forty people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October , and this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
fires were also registered in the area of Gal@@ icia in Spain where there were 4 dead .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ break@@ through@@ s in northern and central regions of the country , and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande was a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European For@@ estry Monitoring System , the forest areas are monitored by satellite images alone in Portugal alone , approximately 500,000 acres of forest alone - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people asked why the civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al from the Bund der farmers of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open streets which were surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , since the streets were very late closed . &quot;
&quot; in addition , construction permits are questioned with a high risk of fire haz@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal to the rolling form , which the government had brought to serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity of the case , if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val continues on the same article by the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;

&quot; in addition to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as inhabitants of information sought or attempted to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the people with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time via the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina , to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was thus crucial that the server was unable to cope with the sei@@ z@@ ure of the 400@@ ,000 users who watched the fires , the website counted more than half a million hits . &quot;

&quot; in the autumn of 1994 , the con@@ quest of Afghanistan started by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings which had conquered the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan became a country of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati was a 13 @-@ year old boy who belonged to the Eth@@ nic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghan . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - perhaps even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy was supposed to break up . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , was just killed by the Taliban and a lot of Haz@@ ara suddenly felt harm@@ less . &quot;
the Taliban are getting closer to the Haz@@ ara well @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself back in Pakistan . &quot;
&quot; for a few years , he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him sick . &quot;
&quot; then he took what was left of his little wage , and went to Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and tow@@ ing s@@ acks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than he himself to earn his li@@ vel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the life of Afghan refugees was characterised by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked . &quot;
there was no services and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we don &apos;t frozen at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and landed on a small , un@@ inhabited island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , went alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day on the day of food . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy has a kind of second chance for the past asylum seek@@ ers , but it is true that the conditions to find asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astro@@ phic . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suff@@ ers under a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3,000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; . &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum , which can be filed for months after registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for an accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;

but his imm@@ ortal lives helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after spending several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af gave his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;
&quot; the film was awarded the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans operated companies , including tailor , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ it@@ ers and the kitchen personnel are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek food . &quot;
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; but A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims , however , reach far beyond the Italian gastronomic sector and the retail sector and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af says with a smile . &quot; &quot; I would like to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I cannot live happily if I know that my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also plans plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can learn packaging and preser@@ v@@ ative techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest excess on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end , stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; the Egyptian parliament checks legislation , which shows that users can only use social media like Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government authority . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use social networks within six months , users need to register their full name as well as their identification number within six months . &quot;
those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of prison sentence or tri@@ bunal .
&quot; the law , which was wor@@ ded by sixty @-@ member members , is currently the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member filed a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the defence of the President or a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under the proposal , such action would be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , so legal experts of the Hizb Institute for Middle East Policy would be punished . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years in prison for the condem@@ nation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would be a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly already has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he was arrested on August 13 , 2013 , while they demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the arrest of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting for more than 700 protest participants who were arrested during the same incident , four years in prison for a trial . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on 20 May because the prison line of human rights groups failed to bring the accused of prison in the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , hypo@@ critical load of inter alia , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ barb@@ ary were free . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested for the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian activists scre@@ amed to en@@ du@@ red documents
&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who co @-@ founders of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly h@@ armed by the President of the Republic , according to the plan , endor@@ sed a controversial draft bill , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ A@@ bid@@ ine Ben Ali of corruption accused the corruption of the government , provided that all of the un@@ justi@@ fiable funds returned . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 , published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , casts a light on how the pre@@ valent plans are to support the law template . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused the separation of his sources , stating the article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press @-@ de@@ xes , which sec@@ ures journalists access to the protection of their sources . &quot;

does China want to force the users of social media to propose their ID ?
&quot; according to new rules of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need permission before they write messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the rules , it is also stated that registration with the full name is required . &quot;
&quot; analysts expect that the elimination of anonymous comments in social networks can be reached . it is un@@ clear , how the authorities will apply these regulations . &quot;
