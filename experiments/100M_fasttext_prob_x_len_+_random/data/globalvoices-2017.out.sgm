<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American films, American music, read American authors, and operated his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a very profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist for an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Gartham in The Pelican letter, a terrible reporter, who had to occupy the murderous conspiracy of an oil-Magnaten, who wanted to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to Method Man," I was it as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that is what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose diversity is so welcoming, that you can always be who you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of equal people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very shy love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me, as he goes with his narrow face."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he keeps his mind behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he tells exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted for him for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he won in the Republican election, was the highest number ever achieved by the Party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters to meet people whom I met in Phoenix during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that people from around the world, a deeply believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"at the same time, Trumps did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met us in our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the Phoenix Suns.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to generosity, which I experienced at Sandy Bahr, fighting her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it still adapts to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, which always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew leey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, who helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those who embarked through them are deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump called his way to nominated Republican presidential candidates, they gave me a stop and the counterpart to its limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the debate with the idea that people have voted for Trump, because they shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost the heart broke me."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the people involved, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act on another way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears are not taken into account by the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">"it could be that these voters, of whom most know, have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that they have disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commented on the cruel decision to elevate a man who looks down with contempt for those who look differently than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(including the" "whitelash" "): as much as" "cassertion of the Whites against all other ethnic groups" "; word game from white in attack on the White and Whiplash, which means so much as Schleudertrauma), as it was the great Van Jones, has exactly what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people all over the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is a powerful idea - which beliefs or background are always welcome, America is always welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as his president, twice the son of a Kenyan man, whose story, as he says himself, nowhere else in the world."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the choice Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge portion of the white American of this promise and says: to Hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back on the helm, say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally in Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd responded with a loud" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"should Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" "fro the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">Have Latinos have a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices were louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and silent "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "thank you, Mr. Trump, isn't your American". "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps land, said the news."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="70">"the music that is played in both places, not only has changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a big garbage dump, just 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds apart from nearby preColumbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now La banda de m√∫sica (music bande) has been playing in the community: one of the children and adults of existing symphony orchestra, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but it changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project, and the youth had a rare hope of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments towards the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca nvi writes:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they are always laughing and with bright eyes and play in the truce you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 75,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the biggest garbage dump of Asunci√≥n in the capital - on instruments that are made of recyclable waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with re-prepared instruments that consist of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycler started by Favio Ch√°vez began to turn parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, viola, celli, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article of Los Angeles Times, Favio Ch√°vez recalls a local ecologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura, at the beginning:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse, and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin made of waste produced.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments from re-prepared material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic Waste Settlement) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world creates about a billion tonnes of garbage every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like men in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo ¬© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication occurs within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"at that time, West Africa was known that this ship had already operated fishing fishing in Libyan waters before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law crusade of this kind to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"in Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the commander, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized rapidly against the ship. they refused to divide one of their ports, and refused to share a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the Prime Minister is surrounded by countries which you simply refused", "Benedict Kiilu recalls a leading employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship's time and persecuted."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to plundering the fish stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects the criminal practices and protecting resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 from the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, members of this network are the six countries that had expelled the Prime Minister from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">This project offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden where it is extremely difficult to pick up. thus the illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the obvious miscontempt of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fisheries were impaired by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snail empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions are now in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that you notice or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, if they move on the open sea by means of satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that fly in prohibited areas, such as those that indicate that a ship invites his caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the ideal case, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a criminal offense."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports. what means that the ships may not sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay for the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owners, which means that the illegal fishing is financially worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already-named platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenues, which will lose eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of the illegal fishery that invests in East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing villages, which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also those illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"such practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake licence papers, indication of imaginative names, fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they specifically use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-complete control system", "says Long." "earlier, a ship could fly illegally and a country could say" "You're not going to run my port." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Komm to me'." "and exactly this legal hatchhole is trying to close the FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">"so far, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its creation, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks that had falsified licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found it winged ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us rather far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to identify suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"the Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to pick up illegal ships."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position." "Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO that also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships can switch off their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be used by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland also helps build a system that connects different information levels, and FISH-i will help to find a criminal agating ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African countries actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has recently opened the Global Fishing Watch platform."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "this is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at global level." "Pew Charitable Trust has to run a similar project where a global system permits prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships, used earlier without license and hardly had consequences, know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i countries now have a 33% rise in fisheries sales since fishboats have ever bought more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia decided to pick up Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are a study object." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars will disappear every year by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015 six countries have joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they now fight the illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i.." "Safety is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country could report his first great triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag."</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "with the conduct of measures against Greko 1, the ship has been stabbed to fisheries," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative working method for protecting the oceans is actually working throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>

<seg id="377">You need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the original and active language skills in order to transfer him to the target language.</seg>

<seg id="379">"for example, French native speakers should translate French into French - not from French into English."</seg>

<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as a native language that could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for overcoming, cost reasons or relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies who do not have foreign employees, can still produce their company internally. then, the Japanese people who are best etched to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good."</seg>

<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, anyone looks at the trauma or the communities who have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each body, behind each bone, behind each bone in hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"for this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal pol√≠tico has called the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" with the drug trafficking ") to give this sacrifice a voice and tells stories of people who were in the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal pol√≠tico describes the project as follows:</seg>

<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusting or sad. it seems like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">"I cannot be indifferent, or consider it as normal."</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year cousin think he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" "heroic crimes" "when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it is that, as if they have lost those who have lost someone, and those who fear that they have happened so much."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the crime of man is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring place is justified, that they were" "resident". ""</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how is the years after something the first time appeared? content in social media, regardless of whether true or untrue, tends to continue."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first release, it has been misleading to cover tragedies that have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this wrong coupling of picture and event -" false description "or" incorrect context "in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - denies not the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What is happening in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank wagon crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted and exploded. 230 people came to life."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country was neglected for years and has been devastated. the streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of battles that were difficult to drive."</seg>
<seg id="827">It was tragic that the tank wagon fell victim to the victims.</seg>
<seg id="828">"the government representatives described a fire ball, the duserning houses including a cinema nearby, which was full of people who were full of the football world championship."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses were scattered and scattered corpses were scattered throughout the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture with the title" This is Nigeria. "from Imgur User Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Multiple photos of the event form the gray-full scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows series of disguised bodies standing on the floor while people are watching them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years, the same photograph was published several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but they were not attributed to these tragedies in particular, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram seized the remote nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" ""</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were buried in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"however, the figures could not be confirmed." no one remained to count corpses, "said a resident of Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were broken, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">Only using satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt to win the Boko Haram (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of misdepreciation; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was taken as a cover for mass demonstrations."</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further enhances personal comments like this example falsely the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange came in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a flash message, the United Nations described those who were able to flee, rape, and some dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported on the violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following that summarized these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>

<seg id="936">"one argument is that the rejection of pictures of a refusal is equivalent to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even required by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, concern is that violent images readers and viewers are desensitizing and the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, investigating how violent media act on it to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot about violent representations in the news media, fact is fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>

<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, the founder of the Treasure Language storytelling (TLS) initiative is the creation of stories in their original language a possible answer."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Firm of the Year for Compliance Audits and Investigations Gibson Dunn & Crutcher Firm of the Year for Corporate</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS is not on the written but spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has been running events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages can not be passed on to those born babies born."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities, accept diversity - safe spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong to."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"during" "listening to often", "these events instead" "listen to appreciate, to feel." ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, history tells stories of history first in their own language and translate or explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not professional storyteller, their devotion and their presentation will lead to the audience."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"they cry out laughter and emotions, when the language is no longer a barrier."</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, published in the last year and is licensed here, contains a number of attachments that deal with the free culture in the face of suppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It's a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"in the introduction, it is:"</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real costs are connected with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on page to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create a sense of our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or place of residence."</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">"to see how Bassel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture, many of us have started to think about their own destiny, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What do we have chosen?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up to extreme beliefs in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activities has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from Adra-prison, a non-military establishment to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" Military Police Bassel was based on a "strictly secret" command of the Military Court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and put them aware of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts remain unknown but remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in expanding access to the Internet and to expand the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Allen, a designer, technologist and currently crossing the head of New Palmyra, a project, the Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes was predictably the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations and merging Greek-Roman architectural styles with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel did not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would do everything to do this architecture, not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This stripping into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"however, Bassel could not close this project until now."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom, and I taught me to embrace them."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel brought me English, even when he was in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he taught others to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically without being in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a prostitute who wrote her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a year.</seg>

<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronouns or say" Father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women that they should respect the husband due to social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should prescribe the norm."</seg>

<seg id="1480">She reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them to ambassadors of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini presented in her discussion round, acted by women who don't name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She has decided for this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the names of their husbands do not speak loudly, is a spectacle that they all ought to be maintained and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Comments: not Commented</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition shows that a woman is respected her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not hold this, is regarded as a hindrance, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never known her husband, had never been named the name, at home, as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband stayed long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"my husband, my husband, turned to me, and said, I should call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" "patriarchy". "some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, were protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the lap, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," "If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, it means that they do not respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it be equivalent to it?</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which she brought the name of their husbands over the lips," "says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the Brechen of a century-old tradition, in the married women who never speak the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she only sat down during the whole exercise, another decided to let the whole anew frustration of him and his family, leaving him cursed."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in adrenaline, with an ancient spectacle, women decided that they would actually try to call home their husbands in their name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a multitude of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in the head: his wife couldn't stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it for dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she stared her, she was afraid and said she was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said, I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understandable and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead, showing the spouse:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the zinnoberred dot if he would do it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not totally ceased, but they think they are now in a better position, even to choose him not to wear him in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip at any discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to make sure that women take care of what could hear," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months she celebrated her own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never done before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years now, but I also have some things, for example, how our identities are made to our husbands, never so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say something loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been wearing saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most of us this is okay, but some wanted a Salman Kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers, wear it; they did not weep."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, the morals associated with the saris and much more, the Rohini gave their own pair of Kurtas (upper hemisphere) into a discussion round so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they now decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure that they will be able to create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question, whether in the five months since her first discussion club has changed somewhat, Rohini confirms that things come slowly into the rolls:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We've only done little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried a couple of times, but then they listened to the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do not make it yet, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women wear zinc red on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the felling of more freedom of movement or the own dress code - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How raw ini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, if every woman goes home at home and other people who talk about what we are talking about and what we do."</seg>

<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the minister noticed that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>

<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable country, we can say that we are not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, what country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons were not very noisy: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal lands', in view of his, he appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"in contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as you reach the core point of the topic, the good old Leier from the authoritarian rulers, who pretend to be democrats, leave the twisted logic because it fits better to its power."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants, Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- year-old mexican girl, a small woman with a korall-pink glasses and gold colored earrings in Teddy Bears form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called Concepci√≥n Gonz√°lez Ram√≠rez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless they know many under the name of Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on the journey.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, brittle walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">"in the anteroom, there is a parrots in a cage."</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hawaiian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ram√≠rez, tells the people in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast begin to cry:" "mom Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">"where are you mom Africa?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the time it is rather quiet, but this year Ram√≠rez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have even slept outside on cardboard boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"they also help them and bring them to hospital if they are sick, they buy drugs that they cannot pay, they massacre them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived at a short time."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if mom Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a Joghurking) posing with Concepci√≥n Gonz√°lez Ram√≠rez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Foto: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very well here.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston in order to revive her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and the Africans often travel together and that Africans are already speaking to Whatsapp from Ms Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil in advance in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey into the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs. Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mom Africa is our mother and we can never go back," he answers. "we will always remain in contact."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ram√≠rez tells us that their guests often send text messages when they are gone to grind them or to report on the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ram√≠rez is perhaps very well known here but it is not the only sparks for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jes√∫s Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family were included in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he started to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered to them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking spot outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he said. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. this is the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he became a member of the United States after a raid on his work site."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"Jos√© Antonio Cordova Mel√©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to compose money without having a plan."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and a well-known, a single-selling, she has offered her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"some months later, the family lives still there and tries to decide where the next steps are going."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is everything again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the courses, travelers can quietly see their telephones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ram√≠rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she feeds in her album with numerous photos."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hairstyles, which she made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>

<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"main function is blocking pornographic websites, online fraud, trophies and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network."</seg>

<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote "state actors or even hackers can manipulate the home network of a person or steal from it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while messages about digital censorship in China are mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often mist for those who live in distant, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities frequently arrange extreme cases and monitoring measures as well as routinely Internet debugging."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"on Twitter based media outlet" Images from Mainland China, "the censored messages posted in China, showed photos from a checkpoint, at the policemen the residents were checked whether they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>

<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones are used in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoke a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib brings the majority of his time inside; sometimes he slipped to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine spotted lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the uppermost floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaib family had been forced to escape from her village in Palestine, where she lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"Hdaib has been a passionate activist for six years, who confronts the conservative majority and questioned its proven opinion on gender roles, sexuality and free expression through art and rapture."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often uses themes like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also demands the core of the entire Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by limits, and he can feel his own statement with the people who have suffering from the disastrous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not grant it openly, he enjoys a special tendency toward U.S. foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as" "Palestinian Poultry of the Second Generation" "- so he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own living conditions," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds," "I think so because I am a man," "while he shook in water solsten Nescaf√© in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is foreseen for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordan law also states that the consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a senseless would have little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"in principle, the blows are warm coffee and the rakes of the Kent cigarette in the nose first of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when one throws a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - how to drink water in the public during Ramadan - to do not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual Frontsman Hamed Sinno, which contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert report."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the members and former press secretary of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert was just cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many claim, the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that represents the established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement Mashrou 'Leila the jordan people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to use" for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should probably not be simply seizing rhetoric, but in fact an increasingly apparent crystallizing reality in Jordan that appears in Hdaibs's work clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib returned to Leibe in 2016 by taking his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre-marriage sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a clearly lowered unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the innumerable women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who are supposed to trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past years Jordan has taken the number of 'honorary morde' - the inofficial outward.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of Ehrenmorde in 2016 reached its climax; however, Jordan has been missing the institutional infrastructure in order to support women, victims of murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law to fraud prevention from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence may be held on indefinite time in prison, and for their release is often a long-term bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee of the family that the woman will not happen."</seg>

<seg id="2123">"Hdaib agrees that his work is political, however, he dreamed that he is his music, which is full of explicit attacks on sexuality, freedom and opinion, cannot be separated from politics."</seg>

<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled" "Santandano". ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, a verse is repeated often:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words," what you want "- whether faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay men and lesbians, and that comments for equality of LGBTQ + individuals still have been censored in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan online program Roya to remember later that his comments from the context were torn, twisted, and his opinion were censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a revised version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib acquires openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals does not apply to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nui, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in remembrance today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nusomething that should work later on behalf of potassies, in the eighth century openly write about homosexuality, why can Jordanier not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, has nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new, that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"even recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service took several former government ministers and members of the teacher's association, with the reasoning that they would have expressed comments on comments on social media, which are deeply rooted in the country with deep in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the Hdaibs concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in Jordan, Mashrou 'Leila has been honoured for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thought and inner changes. it is certain that these changes are taking place in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib dreams, as millions of other Arabs, also, from an Arab world without interference from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreamed not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"it is perhaps the region using music, art and literature of a real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial species-led democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"as far as it is, Hdaib will continue and consequently resist resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the revised version of the contribution" "love messages of guerrilla fighters", "which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"it is not even more important, people who feel exalted to bring affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question arose from the two young Colombian activists Leonardo P√°rraga from the Foundation Bogotart and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation, and inspired them to write the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliaci√≥n (letters to reconciliation)."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only before short, their country was a scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government has closed a peace treaty with the guerrillabewan FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president Jos√© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the columbians, however, there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrillakfighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years, have been exposed to war rhetoric and around the clock their weapons have to be integrated into the life of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society again, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred against guerrilla fighting, has to support them in their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians had to join together and to help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and exactly this did they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages of former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letter to reconciliation began on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, who took place in Bogot√° in February 2017. there had been Leonardo and Cristian to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this declared that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those forgotten that they need much needed."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plane, he told his love to share his love with people who needed the most urgent need."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to build their place in society and to build a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war on a common history of peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2,000 letters were collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medell√≠n, Barranquilla and Bogot√°."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I've never thought that someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the town administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotart Foundation."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC arose as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of undertakings of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's unbelievable how many different feelings can be run through just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between, "said the politician Manuela Jim√©nez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"as I saw in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go into, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-grenade launcher, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Bag."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he said," "Hello, what do they just do?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone wrote me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"in my life, someone wrote something so beautiful, that's why I answer it." "I suddenly ran to tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him completely, and sat beside the garret."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this steamer, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life than war. the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of hunger." "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society there outside, which is waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the first time, students and some leaders of the FARC came to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">"the students were all grown up, and the FARC already reigned in secret."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"for this reason, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years, we have experienced how social injustice on the whole Colombian people worked out. now, where we have the opportunity to create a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"these people who had never been hearing before and didn't have a right choice, and to realize that people who have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings that were turned around through their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - also those who killed, and so much damage, can contribute something and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo Gonz√°lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Dar√≠o de Jes√∫s Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbians have been prophesied that after the disarmament of peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it gives inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to raise up arms and protest for their rights. and that's also totally justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we from FARC now put on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology, they belong to all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, contribute to our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those who defend life as the basis of existence will be imminent."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way, there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2300">"with their help, I left the country, but then something unbelieving."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">"shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without registering me, without reference, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them in the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">And checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">You can specify it in the FTP Folder field on the Publish window.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't believe about, you are in security, just because you leave the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people know, in which hotel you are plugged. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still have contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, on the intercourse of intercourse we don't speak, that is a taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional kaukasic elements I still bear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"so much I hope, this spiritual barrier can't be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give me trouble to look like the person that she reminds me of her past - so on my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that's very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current position in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends do, those who have dwelt?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for this, I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I was talking to someone who has spent one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told us that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he didn't shut up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require proof that the so-called" honor "has experienced by blood."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: now even gay men have been detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend told me, there were not many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, in particular, those who have no rich relatives or who have been abandoned by their relatives in order to establish Kadyrows's judgment."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there so that they can be present as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim that they would have attacked some village or military bases."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically submerged in order to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it only a mutation or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote somebody who was imprisoned one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new of them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself as these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave themselves?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and actions of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already begun in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, already before 2003, I was already known in very Grosny when I lived there - and I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">Go to the top of the page</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999 when the Scharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia wanted to bring us back to the" civilizations, "but ultimately returned to the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were chased; I had colored eyelashes, wore redhead jeans and short Tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of the sharia has never cut me just a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian Theater in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language, there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that means:" "don't go beyond the misfortune of another." ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it often to children if you make fun of sick people.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply did their eyes shut down because they believed that you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"you have never offended me, never chased and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period hold?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister, he began to talk about morality in television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could feel how people began to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"he who had previously been laughed and laughed, looked at once with Argwohn."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time when I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic was steadily worse."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I earned not much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"in addition, I'm still active as accountin."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"at present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teetreffs, meetings, I guide them to the hospital and help them to get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">"I have discovered these people myself, when I removed refuge sores."</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alchemy.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so the nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same like Chechens, who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth, that there is no swelling of them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have those who have the Kabardins which, the Russians, also have what; on the whole planet there are they - but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it's uncomfortable to hear something."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practising Muslims who go to the mosque and fasten during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"know, many think in transitions of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be precise, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed for my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"I'm sorry that I'm so personally I am here, but my last intimate relationship is already longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide, who was caught in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights told that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have a thing together: they were all family fathers who felt helpless on the persecution of the Iranian government, helpless and inable to nourish their families and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, which is a part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny its livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"in front of a century the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took over the power and took a great effort to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the wealthiest and most valuable uses for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the native population gets only little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"Iranian regime refuses to systematically work jobs in local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of tribes, the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>

<seg id="2424">"because functionaries and institutions do not prefer Arab working forces, local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to work possibilities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their homeland of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and surname names to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, because even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated, refuse to speak Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activists alert the alarm before the situation is explosive."</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I did not identify myself with the feminism, nor with the intersectionalist"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photos. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ayomid Zuri and originally published on the Afrof√©minas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say that I am not a feminist, many women are responding to women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well-thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we generally should be all feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women still earn less money today despite the same education as men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation if it is about what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later in various areas of life come to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am double and triple below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: when I speak on skin colour, racism, on black Cis women, on black women in women's LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused under race isolation and discrimination, both in and outside of feminist movement, many white feminists decide to mention feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, however, all agree that women - all women should come together to raise their voices and sing" Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that in addition to sexualised violence an institutionalised form of racist motivates violence that we are exposed to black women in two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or above that black women and women of different ethnic groups earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with migration background often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want that all women, all men and all all men of all skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can not attach myself to a movement, in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account the injustices in their thinking, which focus on gender as well as the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which always has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech," "am I not a woman?" "and also I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a demenable and marginalised being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join me, which is also absorbed by cultural appropriation of our customs and customs to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to revive them of a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional Feminism was founded to give women from different backgrounds a home and to limit themselves from the white feminism, the word" Feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release me completely and completely from feminism and to join me to the Movement of Womanism, which is so persistent for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever before, that we define black women according to our own ideas and go to the spheres that are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womans: reclaiming (for example: Africa-Womanism: as we can conquer ourselves), we can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which constitute the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and inter-sectoral feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, I ask you about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither exaggerated nor ignored, nor refused."</seg>

<seg id="2467">"this article by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on international efforts to resolve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"again, Nabil Musa again traveled over the last 7 years - mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a special concern to the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost than I was a child," Musa tells us. "</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country have fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organisation Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" "if we have no water more, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist, produced, filmed and published."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work lies on persecuted, little considerable subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with their help of suppressed communities, their stories can tell their stories."</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner said Ada B√°ez, that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner who had become violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship, some time had passed and the police said, her statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman showed Balbuena because of abuse, the official ad of Ada B√°ez was not useful."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman passed her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women have a ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence can be reported in the prosecution authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"posted in International, English, International, Sea Powers, Security Policy, Seka Smith | Leave a comment"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really abused, says Myrian Gonz√°lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentaci√≥n y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the numbers available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Attorney General 9600 ads went on for domestic violence. 70% of them went to violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements because of domestic violence in peace.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women were killed, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only few of these crimes are actually indicated." "on every woman who refuses in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"there are two women who do not do this," "she said at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's suicide in Paraguay is not an own offence, the prosecution authorities cannot document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"only until August 2016, journalists included at least 12 cases of genocide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The co-ordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, Paraguay dies every ten days a woman due to violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Br√≠tez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"at the beginning, they did not want to do this, but then there was still. this should always repent for ever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos. but for two years she wore the psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would once become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it, I always thought that only women are going to be submissive because they deceive themselves by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook in which they described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he had ever lifted the hand toward them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">America's strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans-Atlantic security partnership</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse, at least, would have had a certain sympathy for it."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner had misled them."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">"in Victorias, everything began with psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2521">She even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorian ads in the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they did not receive support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a trial against her former partner who developed to an inseparable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of their former partner."</seg>

<seg id="2627">"from the USA to India: how" "Open Source" "seed producers will change global food production"</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outskirts, the first plant cultivated by NASA astronauts in space and has been consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was only driven by his own ingenuity and the question how many salads he can get, limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents have not only been used for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more such patents have been registered more and more plants such as grain or cartons. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmental protectors and experts are also responsible for food safety in the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"Marcia Cross in" "Quantico" "(Spoiler)"</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if in a river a boulder would lie in a river around which I have to dump.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think this patents go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed more than a new salad sores because all the characteristics are already patented, so it is so good as possible and try to breed those features which he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and endeavouring to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">It also has a movement connected to the United States and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding (Open Source).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red romerssalad of the variety of Outskirts in the greenhouse. there will be tested, if plants can be grown in space."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name would rather sound like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open Source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, and are therefore permanently usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the course of the initiative, briefly called OSSI, U.S. breeder can make sure that others can use them freely from them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this does not mean that they do not continue to make business and sell it." open Source "breeders only allow others who buy seeds to breed it, and not immediately remove them - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant species."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Climate change as an impulse for the economy: paths to a climate-neutral</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emitted professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seed plays a role in larger gatherings such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would not try to use the latter, not only little, by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "Open-Source" movement is not occupied with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not."</seg>

<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered because the available gene pool due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive officer of the OSSI, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, such estimates do not exist yet, but experts like Luby suggests that mass-grown plants such as wheat can be patented as a salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are so bred that they show targeted attributes - from such, through which their taste or colour improved to such, because they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for breeder has been declining by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is now much worse than ever before, since the changing conditions caused by climate change are much worse."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture in the United States, the company relies on the conservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property has other breeder units, since" patents and protection of plant varietal innovation are promoting innovations. "" a patent is basically a plan that can follow each step as soon as the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these statements help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees that different: 20 years ago, until a patent is absent, certainly not promoting innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for a long time to breed plants which are adapted to the changed environment conditions, one would have lost the struggle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and it should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it is impossible to make us impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interferes with the concept of patenting the plant characteristics:" "we do not create the characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them, and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do this."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" who breed a variety, also breed its own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monoculture believes that herbicides are needed, bred in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"my concept is very gentlly." ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move in international markets, but smaller than such as Monsanto are), they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" "it looks like I can produce something new, stronger than companies that are patenting."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors are selling my grades in a few years," he says. "with a patent for 20 years, he says."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the USA seem to be a leader in the" Open Source "breeding, the concept spreads rapidly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ") describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, a" Open Source "seed programme."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organisation Agrecol is working on an open source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding differ from country to country, which cannot simply be taken into account in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive Committee of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventional fertilized plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is in the governments of Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch Organisation of Hivos organized a conference entitled" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, farmers, operators of seed banks and seed companies from all over East Africa to find something about the" Open Source "seed movement and the global trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for" Open Source "seed systems, declares that the organisation is currently a global alliance for" Open Source "seed systems, which should be scheduled for next year's official start-up."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger of environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>

<seg id="2694">"in the report, the importance of a diverse, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems emphasises - a connection from the Luby of OSSI hopes that it will soon be able to recognize it more people."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has particular attention to where and how something is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role," said Luby. "we are trying to make people clear that even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2724">August published the network on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">"the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains alive despite this attack and the verdict of Egyptian law and the Constitution by the authorities, which the law actually should defend its goal, to overcome the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it was never as important as now."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities have blocked 21 web pages, such as the Independent News page Mada Masr, Arab-speaking edition of Huffington Post and Qatar hosted by Al Jazeera, because of alleged" support of terrorism.

<seg id="2732">"in December 2013, Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces, while he reported on the student protests and took a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article is mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed concern to the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"but in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of the blog may not be meaningful for the world, it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a siege; an arrest, an attempted murder, pre-loading at national security council, the blocking blogs, as well as any other website, for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proved that I wrote not in vain. in other words, my words have influence, if only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>

<seg id="2740">"but now, after they have locked it and they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>

<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12 we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs started."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the intention of the government to block and filter content that could have access to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which they can go against these acts against these acts."</seg>
