that is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times reporter .
&quot; for a long time before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published a spectacular published that the NSA had stopped illegal teleph@@ ones from Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astro@@ phic US secret service operation in which the CIA has literally been assass@@ inated for a nuclear bomb .
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter at all ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government against cracks and asked him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol of the pattern of the government , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , to pun@@ ish journalists and spy journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Senate , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ sts they can do . &quot;
&quot; so as the government of cracks , he did something that many cour@@ age@@ ous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said he would prefer to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although it is essential for many years , that it is essential for their case , the demands of the government were om@@ itted by cracks . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources can still hide less .
&quot; instead of separ@@ ating and cracks , the digital foot@@ prints could also be done for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his mis@@ understanding , are concerned about his telephone number , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit report , and even travel notes with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey sterling , an CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , it is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the justice has condemned more than all US governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; thus , we set the press work to be protected by the first Constitutional amendments , because the government has more possibilities to spy out all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government permits the rights of Rep@@ or@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can take it from the moment in which they can contact , rather than in the after@@ ward , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that hasn &apos;t been written as a crack , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transfer system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet of Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , such as the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , where only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot secre@@ tly proc@@ ure more information , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outs@@ et . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world will always develop new spy technologies that are all endanger@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology @-@ separ@@ ators such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to bring out missions . it is equally important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
&quot; the report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market . key Questions Ans@@ wered in this Report • What is the market potential compared to other countries ? among the key reasons to purchase include the following : - Gain an outlook of the historic development , current market situation , trends , and future outlook of the glass packaging product market in France to 2019 &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; &#91; on April 3 , 2016 the largest data leak of history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers , &quot; that rich and powerful &#93; are hidden in control o@@ ases . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to explain a statement . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; what
the publication of these documents gives a glimp@@ se into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how clients , banks and lawyers to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Iceland &apos;s prime minister has re@@ signed . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad let@@ ter@@ box companies have in control o@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait to wait for the next release , and to the next contained documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of an agent crime or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should this be done ?
&quot; but the truth is , if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all of their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used to hide and wear their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine how a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ ka doll .
&quot; thus , one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists , or civil society . &quot;
I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; it is probably because there have been no prominent Americans in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but through the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we would have a data check of the Cayman Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples to have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that one needs less information in some US states , less information is needed to set up a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to so@@ ften school children .

it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how to do this in practice .
how does it work ?

&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African minister , who wanted to bring the suspected money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we were shocked to see that all of us had a lawyer to our investig@@ ator , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ jud@@ g@@ ments . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one was handed over money . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .

&quot; it is not about a single point of politicians , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we need to change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound very stub@@ born as if we could do nothing , as if nothing has changed ; as if it is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On February 8 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
&quot; in the last few years , we have seen steps towards more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies . &quot;
the issue found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU records in central regi@@ sters on a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the un@@ comfortable facts is that the USA has gone back .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a draft bill in both parliament chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
&quot; for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes . &quot;
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lines .
&quot; we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say , &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use this type of transparency through laws .
&quot; together , we can finally exit the In@@ Transpar@@ ency , which is now possible to end this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; a day after I had finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a type in the red Mazda remained and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know .
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who knows the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to escape the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard that : &quot; I have a mattress . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Do , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I build up ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such fear that I went out of the bed , at ten peaks to the door , and my bedroom door shut . &quot;
but he wasn &apos;t crazy .
we are still in contact .
the work of art which he had bought from me depends on his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my viewing angle .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood , actually friends who were waiting for them to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; we make a leap of time , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ing , my ro@@ omm@@ ate moves out and the rent becomes increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ches@@ ky : &quot; &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something to do . our apartment is a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay overnight , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great and we too .
&quot; I &apos;m sure , our cheese @-@ ham mel@@ ettes are completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them all over the city . when we passed our last guest , the door fell into the castle , star@@ red Brian and me . &quot;
had we discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
the things came into the rolls .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
&quot; we would like to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; on the Internet , they can then invite other people to stay overnight at them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing !
we waited for the missi@@ le would ign@@ ite .
but they did not .
&quot; no one who is still at Tro@@ st , would invest in a business that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we all learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you see the things that you can do well . we could design . &quot;
&quot; at the acade@@ my acade@@ my , we learned that design is much more than just looks and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who never met before . &quot;
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree trust we are stre@@ amed .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thumb up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I &apos;d like to invite you to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your relaxed phone to your left @-@ hand side .
this quiet flight of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts can feel when they open the door .
the only thing that is personal as your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the relaxed cell phone of a stranger in the hands ?
most of them feel responsibility .
&quot; thus , most of the guests feel comfortable when they stay elsewhere . &quot;
only for that reason our company can exist .

could you tell us on Twitter that he passes for the President of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a little detail at this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor would have presented with his name , if he would have told where he comes , how his dog or his children be called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine , you would have 150 jud@@ g@@ ments that say : &quot; &quot; he can really capture very well @-@ earned mobile phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel if you would have to give your mobile phone ?
for a well @-@ rated feedback system the confidence is decisive .
&quot; at the beginning , we have done some things wrong . &quot;
it was difficult for people to give negative opinions .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest their jud@@ gements were released before we ordered them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they relate to age and residence . &quot;
&quot; in a few words , we trust the people most who are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social inclusion .
it is exciting to add the reputation of a person -- in our case through jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ g@@ ments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation for simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that confidence depends on how much you can expect from yourself . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little about how to &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; as for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- -- if the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; there is therefore an optimal degree of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; &quot; T@@ olle &quot; works in your apartment ! I make holidays with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to produce this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ able luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
&quot; third : a need , which was previously un@@ covered before . &quot;
the business is very good for us .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who dis@@ allowed Part@@ ys or have been devast@@ ated .
hosts have stayed in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the for@@ efront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it is painful when I think only about it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
&quot; fortunately , there was only a fra@@ ction of a fra@@ ction of a fra@@ ction of a fra@@ ction of a fra@@ ction . &quot;
because people trust one another .
&quot; when trust works , this can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him into the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect home for travelers who tend to bite to heart attacks because of sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real prot@@ ections that save lives even though they don &apos;t know .
&quot; you drive one in your own car into the hospital if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want to feel lonely , they bring books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , it does not run any stay . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled over this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of part work together with money transactions ?
it is about economic trade .
&quot; but now simply call &quot; &quot; Rental Industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
&quot; share on Twitter , Facebook , Del@@ icious , Dig@@ g , Reddit &quot;
people lay part of themselves and that changes everything .
&quot; it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what would be if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what would be if at any place you visited , a group there would wait to be able to fill a thoroughly , and show one in a pub @-@ out neighborhood , of which one has never heard of it ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what would be if we would shape apartments by reason to be inter@@ connected ?
how would that look like ?
what would be if cities would accept the thoughts of shared participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already started . lots of parking spaces , which were the government , &quot;
&quot; students , who were looking for a stay , were now offered . &quot;
&quot; they were taught to people whose children were with@@ drawn . inc@@ ub@@ ator programmes were started , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , our platform alone will be 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries at a foreign or even host . &quot;
the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was taught us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
cleanliness and condition In accordance with the description
there were similar websites in front of us .
why so does our work just work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I think this is amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think every time when a red Mazda drove me over to me .
we naturally know that design does not solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ress , a bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
that is true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; in this way , the media represent people who look like me . &quot;
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; studies show : the Americans think , most of them would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim , it is great to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
a car@@ dio fitness fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in
&quot; and I am a practition@@ er , spiritual mus@@ cul@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I decided to do this .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ sted me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual man , as some of my friends , but as Mus@@ lim@@ in . I decided to wear hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my feminist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time , it was a feminist declaration of independence , and in contrast to the pressure that I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ mistak@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not just happened passi@@ vely to the faith of my parents .
I have taken away with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought after , presented in question , doub@@ ted and believed in the end . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dedication that deep@@ ens with every reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k sometimes brings me to the we@@ eping .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone you perceive , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
it feels like it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , like all the good Egyp@@ tians , my career as a engineer . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had to bo@@ ast at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; breaking news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ ill out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my lap turned quickly into indig@@ nation .
why should one do something like this ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I went silent -- when we went silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as Mus@@ lim@@ in . &quot;
&quot; we went into our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations , saying : &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d c@@ auti@@ ously , &quot; &quot; lead in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
&quot; then it was Friday in that week -- the day , where Muslims gather to pray . &quot;
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a destination . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably in@@ filtr@@ ated , and I heard of attacks on Muslims or people who were looking for Muslims . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country had attacked our country .
I have got the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry .
it is not easy to explain itself constantly .
&quot; I don &apos;t have any questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can say to people saying , &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we go ?
some people want to close Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as from a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , ser@@ mon and Olymp@@ ion . &quot;
is the closure of mos@@ ques of America safer ?
&quot; there may be a few parking lots , but not stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular attendance of a mos@@ que leads to people &apos;s other faith @-@ toler@@ ant , and greater citizen participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a head of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in the bed before a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process , one finds that it starts online . as a first , the person will be cut off from their community , even from their family , that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ or their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establish@@ es its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as Mus@@ lim@@ in , as a mother , as a human , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imag@@ inations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux @-@ cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but if you throw a look at them , they do not drive them in their &quot; &quot; Holy Scrip@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ ached to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . &quot;
&quot; from nothing insp@@ ires and something that would have been given to her anger , she was a main objective for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution . &quot;
this Imam introduced the connection to God and its church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they learned in the mos@@ que , they kept the IS to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family are concerned .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy , on our ideas of thought ? &quot;
&quot; a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we accept rather an author@@ it@@ arian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that if one considers testing messages in which negative about Muslims has been reported , they voted more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic issue .
&quot; if you look when the mood of Muslims down to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ Terror , as I expected it . &quot;
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to express the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we feel it may be the first , but the toxic air of fear hurt us all . &quot;
it is not only about the assignment of collective blame .
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both were at school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
&quot; he was involved in the dental medical faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous man , whom she knew . &quot;
she was amazed and said :
&quot; when is such a young man made up of my bre@@ asts ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had posted on his Facebook page . &quot;

&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we left to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we ow@@ e it and for us it was no easy decision because it was about what America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we op@@ ted for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child seat we went silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , put my shoes out , and went into the bones , and what I saw , let me hold . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Imam made an announcement , thank@@ ed and called for our guests , for half of the meetings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who had come not to attack us , but to join us . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I am collap@@ sing . &quot;
these people were there because they had courage and compassion in panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on the number ?
or will you join to those who think : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what you might say to those who might say you have a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a think@@ ers with drau@@ ght , in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t fool yourself . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; if you look at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the greatest ever performed study on Muslims all over the world , people want people to normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people like an exception usually appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; as a platform for Bast@@ ers , shortly before , a billions of euros will be paid . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for industrial dr@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ p@@ etting in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the F@@ RAC Centre has built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces . &quot;
you can also build independently adjustable structures .
&quot; they have learned to wear bur@@ dens , deal with turbul@@ ences and in general react to nature laws . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possibility in autonomous flight .
&quot; a system autonom@@ ously works , it needs to know coll@@ ectively where the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ ender of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space . calculations on board determine what the machine should do .
&quot; External commands are available at the highest level , e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a flight device tries to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gler , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most star@@ ters , it can float , and has a great advantage in the start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a swe@@ eping page . &quot;
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences like wind bows .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter what situation the optimal position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often face fundamental abstract questions which are to the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known around as machines with a thousand moving parts that accum@@ ulate to inj@@ ure you .
&quot; for decades , trained pil@@ ots were able to fly remotely @-@ controlled air equipment , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
we discovered that flying with only one works .
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ic simpl@@ est remote @-@ controlled flight device . it was invented in front of a short time . &quot;
&quot; it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no valves , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no other actuators or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly and move in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it doesn &apos;t have the elegant algorithm of the stern star@@ ters . to get it for flying , I have to throw it properly . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right is low , so I will show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleas@@ ant@@ ness , this machine is here , the omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what do you do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is un@@ balanced .
this is why he is ambi@@ valent in his orientation .
&quot; in this way , it receives the proper ability , &quot;
&quot; in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned , or even as it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some is available in models , the rest is learned directly by flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is comprised of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller air@@ ing machines .
this revol@@ ves in clo@@ ck@@ wise sense
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , there is something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can further fly the machine if even limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate that by making a half @-@ air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration will investigate synthetic waste heat .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weigh@@ s less than a disc bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
&quot; every unit knows where space is , and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the most secure machine da dr@@ one would like to be a flying lamp on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types such as us , wages are in development and the creation of creativity . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the icing on the i .
thank you .
&quot; before 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes surround each other in a very far distant gal@@ ax@@ y , so the mass of three prob@@ es turned into pure energy in a tenth of a tenth of pure energy . &quot;
&quot; this short moment , they were bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire known universe . &quot;
it was a very big boy .
but their energy did not set them in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe exploded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events first time .
&quot; before 1.3 billion years ago , many @-@ lived life was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then , the earth has brought a lot of things : coral , fish , plants , sau@@ ri@@ ers , people and -- God stand at -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group decided to build a very brave -- Ra@@ i White from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector , to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves that are caused by col@@ oring black holes . &quot;
most of them kept it crazy .
&quot; but enough people knew them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ er- Gra@@ vit@@ ational wave observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which improved the recognition performance enorm@@ ously . &quot;
this is why you call him Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run by some smaller , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ded black holes pass through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the Birth of My daughter
and the f@@ arewell from my to@@ d@@ sick father .
basically it was the fruit of my life .
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cr@@ us@@ ade in the feet of space and time .
&quot; when passing the wave , the room and its whole content stretches in a direction and into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lect@@ urers in courses for rel@@ ativity theory often lead to a right al@@ ber@@ ing dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us stretched and gest@@ ed each of us at the bu@@ st@@ ling of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after Kom@@ ma , followed by a 1 . therefore , one declared the Lig@@ o staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that is absurd , this length should be measured at less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are violent . &quot;
but physi@@ ci@@ sts are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles .
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you around you . &quot;
&quot; in case of sounds , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you very much : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now , Alice is talking about . &quot;
&quot; and Bob sub@@ mits her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t produce easy pictures of objects in the universe with them .
&quot; but by looking at changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; when we turn wave patterns into sound , we can hear the universe literally . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gravity , we can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , zir@@ cons simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; if the two bodies turn very fast , one h@@ ears the same cir@@ rho@@ sis with an additional tone change . this sounds like : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- I heard Lig@@ o : &#91; sur@@ ren@@ der Ger@@ ber &#93; No , who knows what he has to hear , recognize this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the others with a mass of 36 prob@@ es , cir@@ cling one hundred times a second before they colli@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
in this there is the permanent importance of lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o eb@@ es a completely new way to explore the universe as it never was possible .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in all we can &apos;t see -- practical or basically -- not see .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mass stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we have learned much about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes happen in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of whom we have no idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found the first things we didn &apos;t expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague am MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , such as Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ ons for our ar@@ che@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the events of all , to the emergence of stars and ultimately , as we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and p@@ inch of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ atories on Earth and All .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for one year , I would say to all &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; say , before whom I feared . &quot;
&quot; no matter whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do I want to speak in the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
do I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start with the spectac@@ le ?
&quot; no , no , no , no , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I feared , was my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , speeches , my social anxiety -- exhaust , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life changed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life to an unexpected situation . it began with a question of my smallest .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak ass . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once , if I could play with her when I was just on the jump . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only before short I understood that &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; say to play with my children my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a author . I think things out , raise you to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I create television . I have pro@@ du@@ cial television .
&quot; I make TV , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for bringing out 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are at the same time in production . &quot;
each show offers hundreds of jobs which did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series run together on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; on the whole world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broadcast that I have created , and not only produced , so still ob@@ last . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans for bon@@ fires and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who is doing this ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a titanium . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; author &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I say it to you so that all of you who work so hard to work if you are now a company , a country or classroom , a business or household , take a business or budget to take me seriously when I say : I understand that it is not only about a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; if I &apos;m deep@@ ened to work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work is always creating a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is when I set up troops , when I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; so as you dream of a high sound , deliver a marathon . &quot;
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting , in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ern@@ al , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing is the sums . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well .
&quot; a sum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows and the Sum@@ ma h@@ ears like a busy street , I could always drive to her . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I tell them the Sum@@ ma that I speak about writing , that writing me a joy . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong .
&quot; but the Sum@@ men -- when I started working with TV production when I started working and working and working , I discovered this matter , this sums , this energy . the sums ! &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
the sums are action and activity . the sums are a drug .
the sums are music . the sums are light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , you cannot asp@@ ire to size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling is not different , as after size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum@@ m@@ ons .
or maybe it means a work@@ ah@@ oli@@ c .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps ego is called ego .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I am not for failure , and I just know that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to put it into question . &quot;
&quot; in order to make a clear statement : the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more covered boundaries , the more work there is , the more things at the same time , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more I write history . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country that I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , sum@@ ming , sum@@ ming , sum@@ ming up . &quot;
I like this sums . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the sums .
is I just this sums ?
and then the sw@@ amps stopped .
&quot; over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded . &quot;
the Sum@@ ma stops .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single work stit@@ ch .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mom is not there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the Sum@@ men stopped . &quot;
the sw@@ amps of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was out .
the Sum@@ men did not return .
my Sum@@ ma was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same title of Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours of working , no regre@@ ts , no regre@@ ts , a titanium sleeps , isn &apos;t on , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect titanium .
&quot; I was a pre @-@ show Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the sums I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; how@@ l you out , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot;
&quot; but you know you are doing it , you are working , one loves what you are doing is a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a pa@@ inters , Bill Gates , and knows how to stop the sum@@ ming when the Sum@@ ma stops , who is then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
I am still a titanium ?
&quot; when the song of my heart ce@@ ases , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; poses a question .
&quot; I am on the way to the outside , late and she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no more than two things to me :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and second , she called me not &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; . &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t call anybody more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I miss it when I am titanium and my sw@@ amps , and here everything changes before my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read all dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing unusual .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of sw@@ elling , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country that I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they do not exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , juni@@ per pins and the song in which it goes down , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; . &quot; &quot;
peace and simplicity everywhere is everywhere .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I am at@@ me .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I &apos;m happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and a power cord comes in .
&quot; and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums come back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sum@@ ming . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let us stay in the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we &apos;ve forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the working environment , the Tit@@ an@@ ens@@ um , that is only the substitute . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I am compla@@ ining about broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums are . &quot;
the sums are no power and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the pleasure .
the true sum@@ ming is dependent on love .
the sum is the power which comes from the lust of life .
the true Sum@@ ma is self @-@ consciousness and peace .
&quot; the real Sum@@ ma ignor@@ es the pressure of history , which is to be enlighten@@ ed , anticip@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the true sum@@ ming is simple and original .
&quot; true Sum@@ men is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot;
it &apos;s just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ oli@@ c from any guilt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I don &apos;t have any other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the sums . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in games , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On February 8 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
&quot; the truth is hur@@ ting , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I am better at work than at home .
&quot; this con@@ fession is painful , for what a human being better than to be at home ? &quot;
&quot; OK , now I just want BF1918 / 2 . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am a master is one of them .
&quot; we rapidly walk around in the garden , and back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we destroyed soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mostly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused . &quot;
I always ask for my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we have to play with the games ?
you can also say it ! tell me if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you keep me nai@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
&quot; you probably have right , but you can do it ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ g show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they kiss something else .
&quot; it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or K@@ eks replaces me . &quot;
&quot; and talk my teen@@ y daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am Mother of the Year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more you do not need . &quot;
&quot; each can bring 15 minutes to the piece , even at a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes on the piece !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no di@@ stra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children beg@@ ging . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my pleasure , my world . it is not to be the children . it is true to feel the Sum@@ men to have a place for peace . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
&quot; in order to &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and store it .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I fail and I si@@ ege . friends meet , reading books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; if you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to meet myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece - why not treat yourself 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sums seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months open a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sums , the sums are not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum@@ m@@ ons .
the sum@@ ming of life .
the sum@@ ming of love .
&quot; the sum@@ ming of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; I have never seen a titanium , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good Mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this Sum@@ ma , the more this unusual , persistent , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am a author . I think things , I raise you to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little more dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a heavy stroke or after a car crash . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve nerve functions by various surgical measures .
&quot; for sure , they have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; this impl@@ anted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered under severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons is the recovery of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with a little help , the brain can help themselves . &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I used patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma .
&quot; they have to imagine that at Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mat@@ a , the brain is weak@@ ened and the skull pressure rises . &quot;
&quot; in order to save life , one must decrease the skull pressure . &quot;
&quot; for this , sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to grow cells from a fabric piece , it is comparable with very small children that will be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and the environment to thri@@ ve . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed . &quot;
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you know that stem cells are un@@ ready cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die ; they are imm@@ ortal .
but these cells were different .
they divided themselves slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but it was different . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our brain tum@@ our cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; at the stage of the fet@@ us , they provide for the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why do they stay ?
we don &apos;t know .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain because we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries .
&quot; however , this is not so safe . &quot;
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly how it did Jean @-@ François
and they subsequently mark them to the brain in order to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we travel@@ ed them to the acceptance of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we travel@@ ed these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ete the same cells in damaged cer@@ eb@@ ral tissues ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we travel@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they had completely disappeared after a few weeks , when they had been removed , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario we made an injury to and irrit@@ ated precisely the same cells , and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you can see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been mat@@ ured .
&quot; the evidence they show , are these small points . these are the cells we use in vitro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
help these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained mon@@ keys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed p@@ ellets from a tray .
they made them very good .
&quot; as they had reached a stable skill level , we missed the motor &apos;s motor skills in motor@@ ised Cort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; then the mon@@ keys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hands anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to people , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously until a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the mon@@ keys . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted his own cells . &quot;
on the left side they see the mon@@ keys that reco@@ vers spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see when we mat@@ tered the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that we were very exciting for us .
since then we have found very much more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s . &quot;
but our dream is still to impl@@ ant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain is the means to heal itself .
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely will definitely be back .
&quot; of course , the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities .
&quot; BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; Moodle : BG @-@ bab : calendar : day view : Tuesday , 28 January 2010 &quot;
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will it permit us to launch it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multi@@ focal study . &quot;
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
&quot; we see democracy not as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at them as un@@ changing ge@@ y@@ ness .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his large desc@@ endants in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy comes to us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as a minister of finance in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not the savings programs that were realised in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if anything would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy .
&quot; I ask you to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save us democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies are united , our future and our great new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
I call it the &quot; Zw@@ ill@@ ings@@ Summit Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognise it as the debt mountain , which th@@ rows its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt of debt , &quot;
but only a few recognis@@ es his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash that belongs to the wealthy as@@ best@@ os and corporations , which , however , are anx@@ ious to invest there where it would be productive and income that could be productive and to produce all the things that humanity urg@@ ently needs , for example , green energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , 3.4 tr@@ illion dollars invested in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.@@ 3.4 Billi@@ ons of US dollars may sound after much money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5.1 tr@@ illion dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the exchanges and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debt and non @-@ productive capital form the twin peaks that are not equal to the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is st@@ agn@@ ating sal@@ aries , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low demand feared the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors that would not invest in which they do not invest . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the circumstances will lead to the fact that Ö@@ di@@ pus kills him . &quot;
this is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents , and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the saving of the earth . &quot;
&quot; so , is democracy the solution ? &quot;
&quot; but before we continue , what do we understand under democracy ? &quot;
&quot; Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society , in which the Free and the poor as a majority have control the government . &quot;
&quot; of course too many of the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy , too . &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the status of the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy due to this exclusion . &quot;
&quot; the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they were depri@@ ved of the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and more decisive , which they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same m@@ oods in question of the State . &quot;
the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept a long term --
&quot; like a candle that sh@@ ines very bright , it is also burned quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not found their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy came only on , as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations -- a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , an un@@ rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , the economy gradually under@@ went politics and de@@ posed it . &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like it earlier ?
it is not a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is in fact that you can now be in the government , and nevertheless not at the power , because the power of politics in the economy is woven and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my sh@@ oring with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors , which nour@@ ishes the animals from which they feed themselves , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that the politics has so far kan@@ ni@@ b@@ alised by the self @-@ induced economic crisis . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , increasing ine@@ quality , and the managing directors of corporations are anx@@ ious to invest the cash in their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism develops the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the welfare of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; reserves the control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist @-@ Left had already had this idea of 100 years ago and it was not very good .
&quot; the doctrine from the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain its position as in ancient Athens , without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low wage labor through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics separate areas , the automation of the twin peaks is higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts lower , as it is -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries such as China . &quot;
&quot; we have to re@@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and ensure that we democ@@ rati@@ cally democ@@ rati@@ ze the re@@ unified field , otherwise we are in a path@@ ological surveillance @-@ hyper@@ auto@@ c@@ racy that leaves the film &quot; matrix &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he has produced .
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is being solved by a D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; or by something that the society in &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; &quot; resem@@ bles the human being , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what do you need , how could it look to have this &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; like D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the company , please introduce a capital market where you can earn money while you work and in which your capital is working for next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you &apos;re currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all income from capital and proceeds from rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , but do not work in it , and employees who work there where the company is not part of capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no more up@@ lifting twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please briefly suggest that our national currencies have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets &#93; , in the interest of the entire humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the whole world trade is negoti@@ ated in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Board on W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have it , especially in the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ ated people preferred , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the m@@ ül@@ mer of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
we will wake up in such a world
or will we merge into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide ourselves politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democ@@ rati@@ cally .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you are descri@@ p@@ tive in your biography itself as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , the technological development will create a massive reduction in macroeconomic demand that Larry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we see it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ se our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as well as Hay@@ ek , that is why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also perfect . &quot;

&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said that . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the impression of democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy on politics , while the area where most of it is playing , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain sense , if I may say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what you can now observe in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China is now ready to do that which the West has done in the 19th century itself , sm@@ ells with hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experience as a finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I am that that comes .

how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; to say to us from the self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the ongoing den@@ ying that a massive displac@@ ement line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to massi@@ vely threatened the development of the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal , which by the way , the first suggestion was , who revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the euro@@ zone , continue to den@@ ounce the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it may be possible for a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
Moodle : BG @-@ bab : calendar : detailed month view : February
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future when we do not change their structure .
Moodle : BG @-@ bab : calendar : detailed month view : February
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister who claims for 6 months in office , especially in a tense situation , he claims that he has no mistake , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the bank@@ ers to find a common solution .
but that wasn &apos;t .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government to case , only because they did not want to deal with the ver@@ ge which ran through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astro@@ phic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one from the Tro@@ ika of the Money , who imposed us this policy , was : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; Moodle : BG @-@ bab : calendar : day view : Tuesday , 28 January 2010 &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone opposite comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the fre@@ ed flow forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have a cat@@ astro@@ phic consequences for Europe , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to introduce the way of a post@@ modern 1930 , which it appears to me , it will be as well toler@@ ated for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;

&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you very much that you were at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; Roy Price has never heard most , although it is likely to be responsible for 22 average minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
that goes back to the decision that Roy had met before three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios ;
the TV production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ yel@@ ander and describes on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technique , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible to write the shows and content to produce the Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any .
he has to find shows that are very good .
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are quite right on this curve . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the site . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows have received this review .
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t care about the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to provide &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the mean ex@@ ul@@ sion , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply exc@@ ite . &quot;
so he must ensure that he really is on the right side .

he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;

&quot; by Andrzej On October 4 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
episode : # 5@@ .04 Devil &apos;s Night ( American Horror Story )
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
Roy and his team are watching everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or look again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of this show can remember because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7.2 is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- i.e. something above the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy he is always looking to find these a super show and he uses data for it , but he makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organising a competition , he and his team watched the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x spect@@ ator , so the reviews they give shows , their course shows what shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use these data to find out these little details about the spectators : what shows they like , which actors are actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four transm@@ it@@ ters , but a drama series on a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
&quot; of course , the question is : what is happening here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
&quot; by Andrzej On October 4 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets , &lt; 7 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it through very powerful computers .
&quot; the minimum thing you can expect is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , then this is something terri@@ fying because we live in a time in which we live more and more to statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes in touch with this software .
&quot; if someone is in jail in the USA and asks for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is prob@@ able that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al is made or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deci@@ ding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately there are evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results . this is not the fact that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; yes , even Google does not make mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it can be predicted by data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way , can predict -- by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderful and was a great news compensation . the success gi@@ fted in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year around year , until it was no longer functional , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it was simply not working , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; &quot;
&quot; despite all of these errors , data flows in decisions of life -- at the workplace where legal enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people un@@ think@@ able can use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I realized some samples of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you have to do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , put this problem into his individual parts , so that you can analyse the details ; as a double , you set the individual parts together to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and set up again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to break a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to put together the parts together and then return to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have it all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again together even if the information is incomplete , even if the information is incomplete , especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe that Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and minds , where they belong to the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , which they would otherwise not have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and making a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; did not stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they are for TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a secure decision because they could always say , &quot; &quot; we say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things are wrong when data begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and not to forget that this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ unt or no @-@ question , you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most probably &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will f@@ use it later with a technical demo .
&quot; I have made some decisions in my life so far , whereby I should have listened to the ball in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much more , like data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; this way , perhaps the ball will be wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that in spite of the large amount of data still pays , make decisions , an expert in what you do and take risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
