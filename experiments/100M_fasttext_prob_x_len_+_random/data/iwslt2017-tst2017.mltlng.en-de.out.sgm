<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for a long time before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published a spectacular published that the NSA had stopped illegal telephones from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US secret service operation in which the CIA has literally been assassinated for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government against cracks and asked him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol of the pattern of the government, whistleblower, to punish journalists and spy journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Senate, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the musts they can do."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so as the government of cracks, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said he would prefer to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although it is essential for many years, that it is essential for their case, the demands of the government were omitted by cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can still hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of separating and cracks, the digital footprints could also be done for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his misunderstanding, are concerned about his telephone number,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his credit report, and even travel notes with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, an CIA Whistleblower and Risen's supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, it is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower, but instead the justice has condemned more than all US governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"thus, we set the press work to be protected by the first Constitutional amendments, because the government has more possibilities to spy out all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government permits the rights of Reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can take it from the moment in which they can contact, rather than in the afterward, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that hasn't been written as a crack, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transfer system for Whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet of Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, such as the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, where only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot secretly procure more information, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world will always develop new spy technologies that are all endangered."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology-separators such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to bring out missions. it is equally important that we protect the next Whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"the report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. key Questions Answered in this Report â€¢ What is the market potential compared to other countries? among the key reasons to purchase include the following: - Gain an outlook of the historic development, current market situation, trends, and future outlook of the glass packaging product market in France to 2019"</seg>

<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how clients, banks and lawyers to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "Iceland's prime minister has resigned."</seg>
<seg id="48">"in addition, there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad letterbox companies have in control oases."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait to wait for the next release, and to the next contained documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent crime or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be done?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is, if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all of their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used to hide and wear their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine how a Matrjoschka doll.</seg>
<seg id="60">"thus, one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists, or civil society."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"it is probably because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but through the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we would have a data check of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples to have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that one needs less information in some US states, less information is needed to set up a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to soften school children.</seg>

<seg id="76">"these were all prejudgments. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one was handed over money. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>

<seg id="85">"in the last few years, we have seen steps towards more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU records in central registers on a national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the uncomfortable facts is that the USA has gone back.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a draft bill in both parliament chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">"for us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes."</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlines.</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say," Intransparent is not good for business. ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use this type of transparency through laws.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finally exit the InTransparency, which is now possible to end this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"a day after I had finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red Mazda remained and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you sleep tonight?" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who knows the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to escape the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard that: "I have a mattress. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "Do, how please?" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "Oh man! what did I build up?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such fear that I went out of the bed, at ten peaks to the door, and my bedroom door shut."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art which he had bought from me depends on his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood, actually friends who were waiting for them to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a leap of time, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost ploughing, my roommate moves out and the rent becomes increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something to do. our apartment is a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay overnight, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I'm sure, our cheese-ham melettes are completely different because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them all over the city. when we passed our last guest, the door fell into the castle, starred Brian and me."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into the rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we would like to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting."</seg>
<seg id="139">"on the Internet, they can then invite other people to stay overnight at them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing!</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still at Trost, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you see the things that you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the academy academy, we learned that design is much more than just looks and haptics -- it's the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree trust we are streamed.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumb up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to invite you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your relaxed phone to your left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts can feel when they open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is personal as your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the relaxed cell phone of a stranger in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of them feel responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"thus, most of the guests feel comfortable when they stay elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for that reason our company can exist.</seg>

<seg id="165">Could you tell us on Twitter that he passes for the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail at this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor would have presented with his name, if he would have told where he comes, how his dog or his children be called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine, you would have 150 judgments that say:" "he can really capture very well-earned mobile phones!" ""</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you would have to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">For a well-rated feedback system the confidence is decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">"at the beginning, we have done some things wrong."</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to give negative opinions.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest their judgements were released before we ordered them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they relate to age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"in a few words, we trust the people most who are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social inclusion.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting to add the reputation of a person -- in our case through judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation for similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that confidence depends on how much you can expect from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little about how to" "Hi!", "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"as for example:" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- -- if the request is not accepted. "</seg>
<seg id="190">"there is therefore an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "Tolle" works in your apartment! I make holidays with my family vacation. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to produce this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievable luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third: a need, which was previously uncovered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who disallowed Partys or have been devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have stayed in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it is painful when I think only about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, there was only a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction."</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trust one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, this can arise."</seg>

<seg id="323">They speak of my church as from a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>

<seg id="360">"a study shows that if one considers testing messages in which negative about Muslims has been reported, they voted more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>

<seg id="409">"before air-petting in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre has built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>

<seg id="411">You can also build independently adjustable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to wear burdens, deal with turbulences and in general react to nature laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possibility in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"a system autonomously works, it needs to know collectively where the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH ZÃ¼rich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, an offender of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space. calculations on board determine what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"External commands are available at the highest level, e. g." "start" "and" "land." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starter,"</seg>

<seg id="423">"like other StarrflÃ¼gler, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"unlike most starters, it can float, and has a great advantage in the start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a sweeping page."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences like wind bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device doesn't matter what situation the optimal position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often face fundamental abstract questions which are to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known around as machines with a thousand moving parts that accumulate to injure you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"for decades, trained pilots were able to fly remotely-controlled air equipment, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospinner, the mechanic simplest remote-controlled flight device. it was invented in front of a short time."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no valves, hinges and transverse rudder, no other actuators or control surfaces, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly and move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it doesn't have the elegant algorithm of the stern starters. to get it for flying, I have to throw it properly."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood of throwing it right is low, so I will show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the monospinner is an exercise in pleasantness, this machine is here, the omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is unbalanced.</seg>
<seg id="445">This is why he is ambivalent in his orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">"in this way, it receives the proper ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned, or even as it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is available in models, the rest is learned directly by flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is comprised of two separate two-propeller airing machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This revolves in clockwise sense</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, there is something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can further fly the machine if even limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by making a half-airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration will investigate synthetic waste heat.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- each single weighs less than a disc bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"every unit knows where space is, and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>

<seg id="570">"Marcia Cross in" "Quantico" "(Spoiler)"</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak ass."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me once, if I could play with her when I was just on the jump. and I said," yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an amazing side effect: only before short I understood that" "yes" "say to play with my children my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am a author. I think things out, raise you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I have producial television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make TV, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for bringing out 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are at the same time in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show offers hundreds of jobs which did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response, or trackback."</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series run together on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"on the whole world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcast that I have created, and not only produced, so still oblast. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans for bonfires and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire burning around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a titanium."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" "author". ""</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you so that all of you who work so hard to work if you are now a company, a country or classroom, a business or household, take a business or budget to take me seriously when I say: I understand that it is not only about a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"if I'm deepened to work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work is always creating a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is when I set up troops, when I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"so as you dream of a high sound, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like BeyoncÃ©.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, exhausting, intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a summing begins in my head, and it grows and grows and the Summa hears like a busy street, I could always drive to her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I tell them the Summa that I speak about writing, that writing me a joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the Summen -- when I started working with TV production when I started working and working and working, I discovered this matter, this sums, this energy. the sums!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums are action and activity. the sums are a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums are music. the sums are light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, you cannot aspire to size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling is not different, as after size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the summons.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps ego is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not for failure, and I just know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to put it into question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"in order to make a clear statement: the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more covered boundaries, the more work there is, the more things at the same time, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more I write history."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country that I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, summing, summing, summing up."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Is I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the swamps stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overloaded, overloaded, overloaded, overloaded."</seg>
<seg id="642">The Summa stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mommy is a single work stitch.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mom is not there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says:" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the Summen stopped."</seg>
<seg id="649">The swamps of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Summen did not return.</seg>
<seg id="652">My Summa was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same title of Titans work, 15 hours of working, no regrets, no regrets, a titanium sleeps, isn't on, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a pre-show Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" "howl you out, stupid author-titanium."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you are doing it, you are working, one loves what you are doing is a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painters, Bill Gates, and knows how to stop the summing when the Summa stops, who is then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">I am still a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart ceases, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" poses a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way to the outside, late and she says," "Mama, do you play?" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no more than two things to me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and second, she called me not" "kittens". ""</seg>
<seg id="675">You don't call anybody more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am titanium and my swamps, and here everything changes before my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mama, do you play?" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read all dramatic from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing unusual.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my pain and panic, in loneliness and lack of swelling, I can't do anything except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country that I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they do not exist anymore."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, juniper pins and the song in which it goes down, or whatever the girl in" "The Ice Queen". ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity everywhere is everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I am atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I'm happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and a power cord comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that's not immediately, but it happens, it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a summing."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we've forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working environment, the Titanensum, that is only the substitute."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I am complaining about broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums are."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are no power and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The true summing is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the power which comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The true Summa is self-consciousness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real Summa ignores the pressure of history, which is to be enlightened, anticipation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The true summing is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true Summen is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic from any guilt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I don't have any other choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to hear the sums."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in games, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"by Andrzej On February 8, 2011 &gt; 9" "Tablets"</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth is hurting,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am better at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this confession is painful, for what a human being better than to be at home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"OK, now I just want BF1918 / 2."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am a master is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rapidly walk around in the garden, and back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We destroyed soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always ask for my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we have to play with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! tell me if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you keep me naive for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">"you probably have right, but you can do it!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a mug show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they kiss something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">"it's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">"after 15 minutes, a MarienkÃ¤fer or Keks replaces me."</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talk my teeny daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am Mother of the Year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more you do not need."</seg>
<seg id="752">"each can bring 15 minutes to the piece, even at a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children begging."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my pleasure, my world. it is not to be the children. it is true to feel the Summen to have a place for peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,"</seg>
<seg id="759">"in order to" "play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I fail and I siege. friends meet, reading books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"if you want to play?" is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training, when I wanted to meet myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece - why not treat yourself 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months open a door, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sums, the sums are not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>

<seg id="778">"I have never seen a titanium, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire is still burning.</seg>

<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this Summa, the more this unusual, persistent, naked and new life feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am a author. I think things, I raise you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little more dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans don't have a chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a heavy stroke or after a car crash."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"for sure, they have one of the most well-known, the" deep brain stimulation. "this implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which suffered under severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with a little help, the brain can help themselves."</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I used patients with skull-Hirn-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"they have to imagine that at SchÃ¤del-Hirn-Traumata, the brain is weakened and the skull pressure rises."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, one must decrease the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse with Jean-FranÃ§ois Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to grow cells from a fabric piece, it is comparable with very small children that will be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and the environment to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-FranÃ§ois managed."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know that stem cells are unready cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided themselves slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but it was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our brain tumour cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"at the stage of the fetus, they provide for the folding of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain because we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">"however, this is not so safe."</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly how it did Jean-FranÃ§ois</seg>
<seg id="853">And they subsequently mark them to the brain in order to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we traveled them to the acceptance of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we traveled these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplete the same cells in damaged cerebral tissues?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we traveled the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they had completely disappeared after a few weeks, when they had been removed, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario we made an injury to and irritated precisely the same cells, and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been matured.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show, are these small points. these are the cells we use in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we see democracy not as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchanging geyness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his large descendants in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy comes to us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"in the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as a minister of finance in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not the savings programs that were realised in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if anything would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies are united, our future and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion, wishes and suggestions. we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey. online Survey Information for survey participants"</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "ZwillingsSummit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognise it as the debt mountain, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognises his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy asbestos and corporations, which, however, are anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income that could be productive and to produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example, green energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the Eurozone, 3.4 trillion dollars invested in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.3.4 Billions of US dollars may sound after much money, until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the exchanges and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debt and non-productive capital form the twin peaks that are not equal to the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating salaries, more than one quarter of the 25-54 year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low demand feared the pessimism of investors that would not invest in which they do not invest."</seg>
<seg id="925">"as a result, the circumstances will lead to the fact that Ã–dipus kills him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents, and especially to finance the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for the saving of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">"so, is democracy the solution?"</seg>
<seg id="929">"but before we continue, what do we understand under democracy?"</seg>
<seg id="930">"Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society, in which the Free and the poor as a majority have control the government."</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course too many of the athenical democracy, too."</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the status of the athenical democracy due to this exclusion."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision on the athenian democracy was and is that they were deprived of the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and more decisive, which they gave them the right to political co-determination with the same moods in question of the State."</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenian democracy has not kept a long term --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that shines very bright, it is also burned quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our current liberal democracies have not found their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athenic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy came only on, as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- the world of corporations -- a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our current democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, an unrelentless struggle between the two, the economy gradually underwent politics and deposed it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like it earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is in fact that you can now be in the government, and nevertheless not at the power, because the power of politics in the economy is woven and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my shoring with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of predators, which nourishes the animals from which they feed themselves, decimated that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that the politics has so far kannibalised by the self-induced economic crisis. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, increasing inequality, and the managing directors of corporations are anxious to invest the cash in their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism develops the" Demos "[the people] from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the welfare of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and economy, and it would be better if the" Demos "reserves the control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist-Left had already had this idea of 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine from the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain its position as in ancient Athens, without creating new ways of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wage labor through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics separate areas, the automation of the twin peaks is higher, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts lower, as it is -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries such as China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"we have to reshape the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and ensure that we democratically democratize the reunified field, otherwise we are in a pathological surveillance-hyperautocracy that leaves the film" matrix "as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he has produced.</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is being solved by a Dystopia, similar to the" "matrix", "or by something that the society in" "Star Trek" "resembles the human being, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora, "in long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what do you need, how could it look to have this" "Star Trek" "like utopia instead of" "matrix" "like Dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of the company, please introduce a capital market where you can earn money while you work and in which your capital is working for next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you're currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then, all income from capital and proceeds from redeeming and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company, but do not work in it, and employees who work there where the company is not part of capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no more uplifting twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please briefly suggest that our national currencies have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets], in the interest of the entire humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the whole world trade is negotiated in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund has invested in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Board on Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have it, especially in the background of a reunified politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe to you is at the same time liberated people preferred, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the mÃ¼lmer of history, and keynesian, global keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we merge into a "matrix" - similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide ourselves politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>

<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the site. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows have received this review.</seg>

<seg id="1074">"instead of organising a competition, he and his team watched the existing data about the Netflix spectator, so the reviews they give shows, their course shows what shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use these data to find out these little details about the spectators: what shows they like, which actors are actors."</seg>

<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I realized some samples of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you have to do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, put this problem into his individual parts, so that you can analyse the details; as a double, you set the individual parts together to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and set up again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to break a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put together the parts together and then return to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again together even if the information is incomplete, even if the information is incomplete, especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe that Netflix was so successful because they have used data and minds, where they belong to the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, which they would otherwise not have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and making a show like" House of Cards "did not stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they are for TV ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a secure decision because they could always say," "we say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things are wrong when data begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and not to forget that this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball. "it's amazing. for decisions using a Jaunt or no-question, you only need to shake the ball to get an answer." most probably "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fuse it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"I have made some decisions in my life so far, whereby I should have listened to the ball in the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much more, like data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"this way, perhaps the ball will be wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that in spite of the large amount of data still pays, make decisions, an expert in what you do and take risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
