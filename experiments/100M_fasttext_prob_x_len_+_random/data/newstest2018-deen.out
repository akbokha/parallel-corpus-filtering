Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps showing your view to the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where you@@ ths are to meet young people .
a tomb chapel where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small g@@ ärt@@ ner farms the former ground of peasants .
the oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to days .
it is nervous when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; that knows everyone who had to be exciting , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i was shown a green me@@ adow instead of a cross@@ road . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of Bavaria in the state government , are all other than current - yet very short @-@ circuit . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread area of the Münchner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ me that you don &apos;t know as such .
&quot; for cities and municipalities more detailed maps , called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ al Sheet &quot; &quot; were incorporated into the large picture postcard . &quot;
this resulted in the introduction of the Bavarian version between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and the first measurement of Bay@@ erns .
your Client : Napoleon .
the French He@@ er@@ es@@ führer occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the second coalition of coalition with Austria .
Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and gave up a top@@ ographic record of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops were with@@ drawn with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 , there were today &apos;s neighb@@ ors who created the idea of an extensive Bavaria @-@ card . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bayer@@ ische Publishing House . &quot;
the original composition sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the Bavarian State Library &apos;s website .
the comparison of early / present is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has grown in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is Unter@@ send@@ ling , which appears to be relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; this entry was posted in David Axe , English . bookmark the per@@ mal@@ ink . bookmark the per@@ mal@@ ink . &quot;
today Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Executive Board of the Bavarian farmers against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing as the fields - at first glance : in writing , a small @-@ scale map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand writing numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ ination &quot; , &quot; derived from the property tax . &quot;
small pit@@ ches do not prove to farmers more - but small farmers of the plant &quot; land in sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 in the Oktober@@ fest , was actually a me@@ adow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the district of the district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads only the street names &quot; &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; On the Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; since 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den conducted the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , which is brought to death by King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time , and ended for example the Ank@@ let of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has instruc@@ ted the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , which has occupied itself for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;

the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ above has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory politics and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , who will be in power until August 28 , 2017 , calls for a special attention to af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i , as a number of question@@ able , racial @-@ based occur@@ ren@@ ces in the entire state will appear in the entire state and here , it is said in the statement of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that targets the disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ate minority interests , the group , the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that happen to people .
&quot; they are beaten or killed because of their skin color , they will be put together or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency we haven &apos;t heard .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group noted incidents such as rac@@ ist attacks against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after having had no fuel during the journey through the state and was arrested by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime .

&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready if there is ch@@ ew@@ ing money or let the relatives know they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI report program of the FBI , which includes the State regarding the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; it is also a response to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to deal with a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , having passed immigration laws to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to the amend@@ ment of the AC@@ L@@ U to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times interest groups have used the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;

now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the stat@@ ues .
&quot; the Americans appreciate this as well as any other , therefore , the sor@@ ely staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Fir@@ dos Square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he was a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CNN on the proposals of the President to dras@@ tically limit the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators would have suffered him if he had done it .
&quot; but he interven@@ ed with its meaning , and in particular the significance that it was written when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you refer to , was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about the contemporary resonance of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not just invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ende waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans by showing the female embo@@ di@@ ment of freedom .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice .
and they themselves are a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ists .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly like Laz@@ arus changed the importance of the statue , the people wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argues that the Statue of Liberty is not a lad , but rather an early Neo@@ conservative that the American flame goes to the surrounding world : &quot; &quot; Lady Liberty is going forward . &quot;
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way to the United States .
pretty unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh found here on something .
the significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative deed of Laz@@ arus was to see how it was seen from the in@@ exhaus@@ tible , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible jour@@ neys to the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; her tor@@ ch is not to illumin@@ ate the way , but hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ aves Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is reminis@@ cent of a time when only two car@@ r@@ ots belonged to the UK &apos;s team .
&quot; the performance director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Championships will be a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland is something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand , and we will continue until we find out , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak with people at Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish ath@@ l@@ ete athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler - which was voted against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; their capit@@ alistic speech was unbeliev@@ able , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish or where they still live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h was very natural , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver med@@ alli@@ ons , which will compete in their fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbeliev@@ able &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots in the British team are . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes during the World Championship was seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; in the past year , Mu@@ ir took five British and two European records last year . &quot;
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m of L@@ äu@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 metres , is another fleet to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is reminis@@ cent of her first world champion@@ ships as the only other fleet in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; to the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men are not only part of the team , but also in some cases also in the med@@ als and the Finn@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about this team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my te@@ amm@@ ates have voted for me and chose me , makes it something special for me , &quot; &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots who belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb up on stages . &quot;
what my speech is concerned as a capit@@ ol ?
&quot; yes , I think they went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship .

the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the papers struck him for all , from the inner policy to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; in the case of criticism , it is safe . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t have to silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and stupid , we will lead like sheep to sleep . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Larry H@@ ogan , who must work to be more like Washington . &quot;
H@@ og@@ an &apos;s employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union advoc@@ ated him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the govern@@ or &apos;s staff dismis@@ sed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na &quot; and ? &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ ogan .
this is a Republi@@ can govern@@ or in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
firm of the Year for Company Succ@@ ession and Tru@@ sts F@@ lick Go@@ cke Schaum@@ burg
he has shown a firm grip on the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and to de@@ vote his ha@@ em@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , is officially designated and of employees who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ an &apos;s spokes@@ woman Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse confirmed the actions of the govern@@ or and argued that the block@@ age of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of tropical or bo@@ iled people , which vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the Post said to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ ogan .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not prof@@ ane . &quot;

&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the message &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people take place on the same subject , then they are not regarded as a so @-@ called collective action , and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the staff of the govern@@ or referred to as &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers varied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous post@@ cards struck up his leadership . &quot;
&quot; and even at that time , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s . &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
&quot; if B@@ ard@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cooked the dinner , it doesn &apos;t use any stove . &quot;
they even rarely use a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the P@@ ani@@ ai regim@@ ent in the quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally than &quot; &quot; not@@ a &quot; &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the cab@@ b@@ age is taken out with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she performs her daily work , such as clothes with clou@@ ded water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were assigned to her fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work may be dangerous : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ land of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupation forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red for independence against the Dutch rule , turned rapidly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua was divided by the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island . &quot;
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and made of cor@@ rugated iron roof@@ s that were converted into different yellow @-@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indonesian have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ an called a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , their dark shirt and their bright skirt . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ ua is the poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst child mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was built in the value of 3.@@ 1 billion US dollars gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources worth $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; however , these riches , however , are a source of afflic@@ tion for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a sti@@ cking presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort charges local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden g@@ ans and will be treated with mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to information of activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands were ra@@ ped by the Indonesian military since 1969 , tor@@ tured and imprisoned . &quot;
&quot; according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission , mass@@ acres in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribe in the 1970 @-@ 2000 were committed to genocide . &quot;
&quot; in the region , the Indonesian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; we advertising everything , &quot; says it in a report of the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ bane in 2016 , reports about atro@@ cities in the previous year , such as un@@ lawful execution and torture - rape and ra@@ inf@@ all are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal ra@@ ging of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week are incidents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have intensi@@ fied since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of people from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % of Christian , but the demographic development is changing because Muslim businesses come from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ a@@ wes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; jav@@ an@@ es@@ ian war@@ den edges sell fried chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people are fighting for here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ck@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ native native to the capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has the local Pap@@ ua , the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian president J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known as J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including P@@ ani@@ ai , on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have agreed in 2014 for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , P@@ ani@@ ai suffered only two months after J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the terri@@ fied children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took off their tone and came back with four soldiers , so the local Pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , pursued the group with their rifle , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child who had 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten that he fell into the coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby government Commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated on the next day . &quot;
&quot; approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice . &quot;
&quot; they wore cer@@ em@@ on@@ ite Jag@@ db@@ ö@@ gen , and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle , and a bird @-@ s@@ ang im@@ i@@ ding - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe . &quot;
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio : &quot; &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; says it in an official document of TIME , which has not been released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and cried to rest and called the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot down in my left wrist , &quot; he told TIME on the veranda of his colourful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who has fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin was the witness of shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only carries a name , the TIME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief investig@@ ator of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that his officers would only &quot; &quot; secure their station &quot; , &quot; because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokesman of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured . &quot;
the news about the killing came only on the following day &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of victims and sw@@ elled to address the historical mis@@ fortun@@ es in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like to be resolved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Minister , Wir@@ anto , said that he obj@@ ected an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the co @-@ operation of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries suffered a long time ago .
some were in the 90 days and the beginning of the 2000 years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke on June 5th in Jak@@ arta with TIME and said , he did not have plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , who was accused of &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua have already been submitted in Pap@@ ua , including the P@@ ani@@ ai . &quot;
families of the P@@ ani@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ mm@@ able dis@@ belief .
&quot; I was interviewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I have been afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ o@@ bus repeated the view that people in P@@ ani@@ ai fear to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the con@@ no@@ isse@@ urs have not stopped .
&quot; on Tuesday , the Indonesian police on villa@@ gers in P@@ ani@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; during a confron@@ tation between the villa@@ gers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to put an un@@ conscious man into the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who re@@ acted by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian par@@ am@@ ilit@@ ary police ) began to shoot down the crowd and killed .
&quot; we were so in panic , we fear that revenge will give revenge , &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and is witness how the last place is delivered quickly , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; I have hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to withdraw the officers involved in the account and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the area .
P@@ ani@@ ai was always an accident for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green Hoch@@ land of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many closed the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from P@@ ani@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den K@@ og@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; as a reaction , thousands of people arrested in P@@ ani@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some dive never again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , P@@ ani@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
people here are building everything they eat : particularly not@@ a and fruit and leaf vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who are able to process four or five fields of fresh@@ water .
&quot; they retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest on the local market is sold . &quot;
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ as ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown since the opening of new flights to the Nab@@ ire airport in larger numbers . &quot;
the few jobs that are in the region usually go to the better trained and well @-@ developed migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe of P@@ ani@@ ai . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world away from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of the reporting of international media remain tense . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission for fil@@ ming was given . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Head of Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is election campaign were not realized in order to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who attempt to report from In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens in the eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , trying to report visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighb@@ ors of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six pa@@ zi@@ lian states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ ania Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; diverse and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the P@@ ani@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ na N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group , and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to disc@@ ern the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also participated in the meeting , but an@@ onym@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably not be able to vote again for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai Sch@@ kis@@ ses , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , chairman of the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; he wants J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i knows that the P@@ ani@@ ai people know that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , apart from it , lives under the constant threat of a common military base , in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , have to consider their voice for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; fault &quot; &quot; which he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in spite of threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the P@@ ani@@ ai cast sacrifice led to the last symbolic act of the Trot@@ sky@@ ist : the bodies of a victim were buried in a terrain closely opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;

&quot; last year Tes@@ la delivered 8,@@ 000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models will be put together - 500@@ .000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are available per day . &quot;
&quot; today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must be expected at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la creates its brand new , never in practice tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;

&quot; it is a period of time passed on October 1 , for States to comply with the standards of 2015 for the ground near o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced that he would be reluct@@ ant to comply with a year to study the plan and to avoid taking the plan in local decisions or to obstruc@@ t economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Public Prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been repe@@ ating , to block or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal backing for the section regulatory rolling back agenda .
&quot; last month , a federal appeals court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane checks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt had suggested that its implementation of o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely ful@@ fill@@ ment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; in earlier devast@@ ations , the EPA often did not observe the dead@@ lines for the execution and then waited for the implementation of activation groups and others , and in an agreement reached the date for the implementation , &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who la@@ yed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us , serious . &quot;
&quot; however , the opinion of the EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; authority for delay and all other legally available full &quot; powers to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ can in Congress will push for a broader re @-@ implementation of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; in the last month of approved legislation , the implementation of the rules of 2015 should be delayed for at least eight years . &quot;

&quot; the association argues that at the time of author@@ isation on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentration zone exists at the time in Vier@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones should prevent a &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , but the district government of Düsseldorf was not approved because of a fault . &quot;

tran@@ scri@@ bed by telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called for a telephone at the Mexican president En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to , to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president compla@@ ined him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him : &quot; &quot; this cannot be said to the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and gay , Mexico for the project . &quot;
transcription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull has also been published and disclosed a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Wei@@ bull that a trade for the USA refugees who went to Australia &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence of the trade that was im@@ part@@ ed by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; &quot; deport@@ ation &quot; &quot; after he proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees in the USA . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump concluded the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford mass@@ acre : militants launch rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and r@@ ump@@ ed onto the Ford bridge of Moore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white rider had to reach the bridge , a group of white men met with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the Mob@@ s - a man of middle @-@ aged in a needle strip - took a long train on his c@@ ig@@ ar and g@@ lan@@ ced through the wind@@ shield .
&quot; inside , the occup@@ ants suspended in fear . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want these n ---- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the silence , when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene was played on July 22 , only a post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; but if a sl@@ ing is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all of the audience appl@@ au@@ ded very real sigh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizens are coming back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ comprehen@@ sible that in all these years , no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirty spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former convention bure@@ au of the State Georgia and a lifetime citizen .
&quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot return to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a court physician lays a towel over the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI files found by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding County were suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ making process . &quot;
but nobody was ever charged .
&quot; although the suspect has been on the free foot , citizens are saying that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens to leave their voice in Georgia for the first time . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the choice , according to information of the FBI , Roger Mal@@ com had a white basic owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby that she wore was not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from the prison , the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her C@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they went away from the prison and the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b round about it . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the Mor@@ de , includes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the murder , the evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot;

&quot; the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will build up more 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be started to overcome the pressure with which the company is faced . &quot;
&quot; the job cuts , the General Director John Fall@@ on announced mostly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , in which already 4,000 jobs were lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan for cost reduction by another 300 million pound ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning . &quot;

&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kabul , killed a soldier of Nato and wounded several others , say officials . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured , a statement issued by Nato . &quot;
&quot; according to reports of un@@ approved local reports , there were also three civilians in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
&quot; the bombing is the last violent assault which Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ assy in Kabul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement of NATO , it means that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured in a stable state are in a stable state and will be treated in the U.S. military hospital on the Bag@@ ram .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1.6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite District of Kabul . &quot;
the Taliban said they would have done this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a massive bombing in the city of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops displac@@ ed the Taliban from the power . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in the last weeks also have caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and particularly in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA ren@@ ews decision to delay the smo@@ g rule after k@@ illings
&quot; the US environmental protection authority has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , according to what the states are committed to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ induced emissions . this was a day after 15 states involved the agency because of the stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the commitment of the agency to work with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA that should be measured in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions , to determine where sections must be made to delay the stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental contributions , which the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda , which is supposed to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of demo@@ crats and nature groups that worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone can reduce the lung function and strengthen the respiratory symptoms , such as as@@ thma . &quot;

&quot; indeed , it will still take until the area belonging to the church community is still alive , but there is no plan for planning for the project more than a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion regarding a shared space . &quot;
one of the two investors who are still in the boat is offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would have a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and majority of the community floating above , such a common room cannot be seen as a meeting place only for the residents of the sen@@ iors , but open to the community . &quot;

&quot; the decision , which has been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget , has already been decided in the past fall , through funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a joint room would be , so reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the resolution of the decision is to signal the investor that one wants to throw a ni@@ pple between the legs , the conclusion that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the environmental structure - as well as the roof @-@ roof - which reduces the height of the height and the construction of economic power - would be possible . &quot;

&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; since 2003 , a Plan@@ etary Route is available in Göttingen since 2003 . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star @-@ path &quot; &quot; come to meet the need for the information needs of many har@@ ass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; it connects nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and stars .

&quot; later , the train trail will be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the track path , the viewer experience a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is stronger than another , although it is much more distant . &quot;
in which star picture you find yourself a selected star and when it is best to see .
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been running at St. Andre@@ as@@ berg at the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Con@@ servation , the location in the midst of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark regions in Germany . &quot;

&quot; since 2003 , there has been something similar to the planned star @-@ wer@@ g in the Uni @-@ Stadt since 2003 . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the plan@@ etary route leads up to Ha@@ in@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality track ) with the Plan@@ ets Sed@@ na . &quot;

IPTC : caption Billy Talent live at the Greenfield Festival in Interlaken ( Switzerland ) on June 13th 2009 . IPTC : copyright Notice Copyright by Shelley Jambresic .
&quot; that were two opponents too much , and we have to fit into Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ erk@@ ets should also be further optimised . &quot;
&quot; and a fool after a fre@@ t , the Fort@@ resses don &apos;t want to catch up anymore . &quot;
for the future it will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line .
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better cour@@ age@@ ous after the experience in preparation with the triple chain , than with the quad@@ rant . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we can act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we are just in the tri@@ b@@ une at the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Fo@@ ster players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; it is a prerequis@@ ite for us , but that we are still better harmon@@ ising and we don &apos;t afford such a lot of clearance mistakes . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann will also drive to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if one can speak after an un@@ decided by a mis@@ erable start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot;
he didn &apos;t want to know anything .
&quot; the start to the season I only evaluated after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not like to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a bad weather . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that the players may even be something fresh , as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an asc@@ en@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know as 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; says the Fort@@ una &apos;s inner def@@ ender . &quot;
&quot; at last , guests from the Rhin@@ eland are going to be a lighter favourite on Sunday in the meeting at the last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we are taking it away , only because we have the right to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; spark@@ le , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el , whose record is quite positive in only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundesliga we have to beat from the outs@@ et , &quot; explains Fort@@ una &apos;s chief coach . &quot;
&quot; to meet such a statement , arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so spark@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday .
new results for Swedish asylum seek@@ ers published by Swedish asylum seek@@ ers
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ ens@@ ic Medicine ( Rä@@ tt@@ s@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun to perform tests last year .
&quot; they should be more accurate during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authority ( migration ) has been critic@@ ised for mistakes in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were inf@@ erior in age . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the forum sic medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency reported that the person &quot; may be 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot; &quot;
tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , from the forum sic medicine Agency , the results are resistant to recent months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are quite constant , &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person has been judged over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers have lied about his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the examined person was 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 results , it established that in 243 cases the person had told the person that she was 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , when the x @-@ ray shots of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I shots are made of knee joints that are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a skep@@ tics is the end@@ oc@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they were earlier or later than usually caused by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the kind of measurement should be used .
evaluate the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do so as if we could &quot; , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of getting a child as an adult is small . &quot;

the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .

&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach now has a 1,@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge boards on the north side . &quot;
&quot; this is a edge fastening , which is also used as a way of operation . &quot;
&quot; at the southern part of the bridge , a 2,@@ 20 meter wide bridge should be used on Friday . &quot;
the pedestrian path will then proceed .
&quot; the special thing is that it is about manufacturing parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ z@@ wo . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge panels .
a special finger@@ tip feeling has the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; there is also a fiber optic cable , where many companies are connected . &quot;
&quot; in the run @-@ up of the work , the residents were informed of the plans beforehand . &quot;
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting feed in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic lane is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for building work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bacher Straße entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den is full of closed . &quot;
the cost of the three bridge stations is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .

&quot; the worldwide leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it is not the moment for the country to be taken back into the sport . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yla@@ kh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships , that the exile of his country out of the sport was correct and that he was determined to combat the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes who were caught by cont@@ ests in competitions gold and silver med@@ als . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress held responsible for the maintenance of the ban on which in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) had found evidence on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e . &quot;
the entire Council and the whole Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized that they have experienced quite a few hot days and will be able to make sure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ l@@ ete from the dec@@ eased system , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
nine Russian athletes will start at the athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships that begin on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .

&quot; in 2016 he went into retirement , and also put the title &quot; &quot; princ@@ esses &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ed eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumer and consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food warning , the federal states provide the most up @-@ to @-@ date information on the eggs concerned . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if according to all that we are currently aware of , a health haz@@ ard is practically impossible . &quot;
&quot; - Deals by Sub @-@ sector - Chart and table showing information on the number of deals and value reported by the company by year , for a five year period . &quot;
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has turned up immediately and has since become known to Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has just like the manufacturer to ensure that the sold products are safe and harm@@ less .
&quot; if at eggs of the back level content of 0,@@ 00@@ mg / kg , these are not traffic @-@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ contaminated eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time the factories are not blame .
seats production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current level of knowledge , the production companies are no immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they have to reck@@ on due to mut@@ ually illegal practices of service providers with economic damage . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the harvest . &quot;
is it only missing on the staff or even at the encrypted jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have been exposed to the process .
&quot; however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent enlighten@@ ment of such events and hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where crimes can be made are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made several times clear that I expect a complete education from the responsible authorities .
is the regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary in food@@ stu@@ ffs ?
consumer inside and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and secure food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide in the food industry is used , consumers are entitled to right . &quot;
&quot; by means of the pan@@ try means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are getting into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of life @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
it has to be consistently worked on all levels and with high pressure .
I expect from all the relevant authorities that the property is quickly and completely enlighten@@ ed .
how the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ obstruc@@ ted expenses of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , because the leading organization that monitors the European game has super@@ vised the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious champ@@ ions league tournament . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make money loose with certainty that N@@ ey@@ mar will sign and bring him into a gal@@ ax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the teams through the energy rich rulers of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs must have a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must be controlled with legitimate sources of income that allow them to play the break @-@ even point in their soccer @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs in their quest for success had increased enorm@@ ously , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ked to ruin when banks or owners returned their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P dropped from concentration on the debt of clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and to build a global brand - to be harder . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P settlement period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to € 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen by the presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to deter from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly intensi@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so who is responsible for FF@@ P in the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P over the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause from N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount of invo@@ icing over the duration of his contract . &quot;

&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most serious sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine fine of € 60 million ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the team members of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs who could try to sur@@ pass their financial supervision by adop@@ ting their income by companies , which are linked to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catal@@ an company could be sponsor@@ ing the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of PSA was infl@@ ated by Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come over payments of the Organis@@ ing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
&quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar in 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s WM amb@@ ass@@ adors will be able to find out , and a great manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could easily be able to find out . &quot;
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more atten@@ tive to observe the rules .
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar transfer , saying on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associated Press , because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .

the association assumes that turnover fell by at least 30 percent after signing the signing .
&quot; the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s escape , claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the Club and the State , &quot; said the President of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding the latter ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e W@@ enger , whose club is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that is financed by a club . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country owns a club , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because you go different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;

No@@ stal@@ gie goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Detective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era , and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ ehler and Paul Rud@@ d went to larger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally par@@ ody and embo@@ di@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories . &quot;
&quot; but as a freel@@ ancer , it feels like the time is scar@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not just because of his absurd Hum@@ ors ( it contained a original story for a speaking can vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Years L@@ ater &quot; , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody goes more than the casting principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ er years as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cradle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand That the Wie@@ ge schau@@ k@@ elt &quot; ) . &quot;

&quot; the main controls - a tough guy Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English . &quot;
it &apos;s a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some beautiful G@@ ags to watch ( the police spend time to watch chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find the voice out &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ rade Detective &quot; is committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drummer - a mur@@ derer , who carries a Re@@ agan mask , becomes involved - that it is often like a single one . &quot;
episode : # 5@@ .04 Devil &apos;s Night ( American Horror Story )
&quot; Com@@ rade Detective , who has been re@@ acted to a lesser extent , could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef have always occupied the American emb@@ assy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who swal@@ lowed a bunch of ham@@ lets . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators do not do wrong : we even make it even with our own younger history and with them .

&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.25 % , whereby the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;

&quot; the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by increasing inflation and marginal employment increases , since the sharpen@@ ing first becomes even worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; it added that monetary policy cannot be prevented in the next few years , but it added that wages at the end of their three @-@ year forecast would be significantly lower . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pound , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption spending . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes from a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the pla@@ gue . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably last four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .

&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight against the high Court of the High Court .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ posi@@ tional provision of pre@@ posi@@ tional phy@@ la@@ xes ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high risk co@@ effici@@ ents by around 86 percent , is now delivered by health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he declared himself ready to finance the trial after the Court of App@@ eals confirmed the Supreme Court ruling that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p , despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday announced , N@@ HS England leader Simon St@@ ev@@ ens was gre@@ eted as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liver@@ pool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to follow the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in all UK in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ posi@@ tional phy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicine that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases .
pre@@ p before sexual inter@@ course means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medication may be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual inter@@ course .
&quot; those who come to the treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in hospitals , suitable participants will be identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a home@@ owner can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will receive £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs in this week after an international competitive order .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by being collected and implemented in a large scale , as it is used in a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to the prevention of HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity .
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , when it is targeted for need@@ y and vulnerable people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; in September , people with high HIV @-@ risk have access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement .
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be done that the study is done quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p @-@ testing medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Shadow Health Minister said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ating . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is done as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will help to end the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society . &quot;
life live : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court Apartment into a generous home .
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , spent in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
&quot; it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace , and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags . &quot;
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I was searching for something that was comparable to my price .
&quot; this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
&quot; I have been in love with them , and made an offer on this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a welded layout - one had to go through the kitchen to enter into the bedroom - wanted to add a storage room and an mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , they commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill who had 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms overl@@ apping each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine , where one could stand . &quot;
fan had to think creative in order to resolve the issue .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on each other without having to b@@ other ourselves .
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled the fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classical copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us can look down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous residential area . &quot;
&quot; you will find these under &quot; &quot; Tools , Internet Options , Security &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Tools , Internet Options , Privacy &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mirr@@ ored to allow him to work for longer . &quot;
in the kitchen feel the reflection like a window into another room .
the entrance offer mirr@@ ored units space for all cut@@ lery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering , &quot; Er@@ fan explains from the steel rein@@ forcing , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is important , so that when you push the door very easily , very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or as your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate bro@@ ker will enter a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and that will help you create an emotional binding in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot;
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of something quite amazing .
&quot; indeed , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers fighting for a 500 million US dollars in real estate
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dy@@ nas@@ tie , in a confron@@ tation with one of the largest real estate corporations in Vict@@ ori@@ as in the value of more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties in value of more than half a billion dollars , since the family had bought a store in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the town zen@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; principal provider and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court records that this means that Col@@ in &apos;s property has a value of 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash money has been shown for Paul as a challenge point for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in proposed to leave him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several unsuccessful attempts , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims to be excluded . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in argues , this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul to manage some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says , he hope to put the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian inheritance claims that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both sides held law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ acies from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood properties where Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ k family .
&quot; Col@@ in says that he started West co when he was &quot; in my last years of the High School , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers before judgment , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis Group , with Col@@ in claims that Mark when leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars were paid . &quot;
&quot; Luke as well as Mark , Paul said above the conditions of its financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has maintained himself very well , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media participated in Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .

others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if yes , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Staff of the White House plans to restri@@ ct the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including the reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a uniform course . &quot;
here is a bit of reporter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions , if he would get good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to count Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship to television is enough for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former electoral officer Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habit under control , according to six former election officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habit has ever been under control is ridicul@@ ous .
perhaps these campaign problems do something that we don &apos;t know other - that tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets could not contain any more ignition .
we will probably never know anything about the Twe@@ ets that d@@ ump is not sent .
&quot; when his staff managed to keep him away from him , their efforts were worth it . &quot;
&quot; but no one has to prevent it , that Tr@@ ump Kon@@ tro@@ ver@@ sen calls forth . &quot;
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a White House , which are composed of competing parties , always try to introduce their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump material that might promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO - quite busy with this story - reported in May , about the pre@@ sidents of the consultants , the president for strategic reasons . &quot;
this was an example described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump is able to react like a volcan@@ o on negative press releases , especially those with dam@@ aging le@@ aks , and that he will find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened at the end of February when someone called the president mal@@ ici@@ ously a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy staff of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , to be the source behind a bunch of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
even though Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter or that he has not offered specific evidence or that he has expressed false accus@@ ations and re@@ vo@@ ke them in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask people about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper kra@@ m . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; maybe he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make cell@@ ys mission very difficult .

travelers negoti@@ ate over a tren@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aires &apos; row
&quot; some of the wealth@@ i@@ est land@@ lords of West Mid@@ lands are again faced with a few determined travellers on the foot of war , which have been tra@@ ded by the congregation in order to rec@@ laim a field from their homes . &quot;
&quot; travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous street from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aires . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transport , after they were thrown out in May without having been exposed to the tren@@ ch from the Council to prevent their attacks . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense equipment and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry inhabitants have urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday night , after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they cast stones on the pass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced by Sch@@ am to implement action , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , and were moved back again . &quot;
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live at the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my common@@ place , if the Council cannot stop it . &quot;
&quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we just have only seen the last round of these travellers only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area .
&quot; a spokes@@ woman in the Council of Soli@@ hull said , &quot; &quot; We are a un@@ authorized bearing on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can continue as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people sign an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to check , when we proceed to our case . &quot;

the house before the gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .

&quot; with the closing of the Hotel Birk@@ enhof on 13 April 2014 , approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and revenues are lost by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatic rising numbers of refugees who came to the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which caused controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers due to the establishment of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .

climate change as an impulse for the economy : paths to a climate @-@ neutral city
&quot; for more than 30 years , however , there have been a series of unusual co@@ h@@ orts in the region , the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background . &quot;
&quot; according to the opinion of many researchers , this can be related to heating . &quot;
date : 06 / 14 / 2009 Size :
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it is always growing on the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula .
&quot; in the north of this Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra , the balance of wax and vom@@ iting was disturbed by some years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra is broken there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , because the front edge has never gone so far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the iron sheet is under tension and can be broken down if at a key point a piece will break down . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , as they float on the water and ur@@ ges ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the shr@@ ine leads to the glacier directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in small dimensions , the British research project to observe Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s of Ant@@ arc@@ tica , with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean of approximately 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural event and no direct connection to climate change is aware , the ice shield is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Lear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most important retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will continue to grow again or in the long run , and possibly together , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even though these explor@@ ers do not lead to the decline of this gig@@ antic ice storm , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula can be de@@ pl@@ eted by the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula . &quot;
this long Zi@@ ef of Ant@@ arc@@ tic extends towards South America .
&quot; after data from the research program British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the polar area of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula has gone back to 28@@ ,000 square kilometers . &quot;
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula has heated around three degrees in the last 50 years and count towards the areas where the temperature is at the fastest .

Italy has intensi@@ fied the tone of NGO @-@ migrants rescue boats
&quot; in Italy , NGOs have warned the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue to continue to comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs don &apos;t sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner newspaper La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Jugend Rett@@ et &apos; , because their team worked effectively with human hands in a way that facilit@@ ated the illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organization , which has been in operation since a year , declined to express itself to the detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian citizenship of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are sorry that we can &apos;t operate in the search and rescue operation at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can judge all the accus@@ ations that are currently raised , only after we have collected all information and evaluate the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had monitored the boat from &apos; Jugend Rett@@ et &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is suspected that his crew will take infl@@ atable migrants on board , which can be delivered directly by human hands , and that the s@@ mug@@ gl@@ ers can be shut down so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least such a meeting was report@@ edly held only 1.3 miles before the Liby@@ an coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected of being attacked by the authority of the Italian coast guards , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not of any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have been prepared to hold themselves to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would have no significant changes or disabilities to their rescue actions . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ates Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy had been strongly with@@ drawn , that the efforts to strengthen the Liby@@ an coast@@ guard and co @-@ operation with local people . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Liby@@ an citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ ad , Niger and Mali regarding measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;

&quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind Git@@ tern and five years have been exposed to mal@@ nutrition . &quot;
&quot; in June , Carter was sentenced to death by Conrad Roy on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally . &quot;
my son was my best friend .
© Warner Bros@@ . Entertainment Inc .
&quot; she was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representative argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a psych@@ ic illness . &quot;
&quot; in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter was standing with tears in the eyes , folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor . &quot;
they ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
she has no regre@@ ts .
&quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said , &quot; &quot; It is a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she totally regret . &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he didn &apos;t find out that her &quot; age or maturity , or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a state prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is no day in which I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I would like to be proud of me and as I do with everything . I try , despite all my pa@@ ins , which we will carry for etern@@ ity with us , for his sisters there is it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said it was &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; &quot; that she would never be part of the wedding of her brother or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this single person , with which I was working every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep in my life for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime committed to commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case with@@ drew national attention , after Car@@ ver &apos;s text messages revealed that they had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging on , spring from a building , ste@@ er yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is to switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should take advantage of any press .

&quot; Audi is to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers see themselves confronted with a return reaction &quot;
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi told BMW , that it would be possible to update the software in more than 350@@ ,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chair said , the company was the opinion that &quot; there are more smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; and so on European cities - including Munich , where BMW is resident - diesel vehicles to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the company as a call@@ back .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nitrogen ox@@ ides , the diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the costs for automobile manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alization of diesel vehicles exposed aggregate exhaust gases , also assume that it is difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also indic@@ ted to fri@@ ghten the powerful car companies and ignore the problems of the problem .
&quot; the companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be placed in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities had accused of having installed a system to cope with emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States was expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be heavily loaded : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the profit of Volkswagen .

&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the Lav@@ en@@ del in Provence is effectively endanger@@ ed because the plant has been exposed to climate change in the past few years and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , transmitted to the d@@ warf , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;

&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil .
&quot; the solutions that are taken into consideration include a better water distribution and slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spr@@ inkl@@ ing of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resili@@ ent to d@@ rought . &quot;

the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce normally arrive on Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
it was told them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what is safer : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the reporter , to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and pan@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; there are drug s@@ mug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest from violence , and while throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses accum@@ ulate , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to joined his office in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , her editor and her inspiration from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although in 2010 a Son@@ der &apos;s Office was established in order to process the cases of journalists , this was initiated by the Committee for Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , each year with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely questioned . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still continue to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally and even though the terrain is still more tra@@ pped . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting to discuss security is little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very foo@@ lish to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we are mis@@ guided . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez was leaving the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the province capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was forced out of two men , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; &quot; Zw@@ öl@@ fter River &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the hat went away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ours tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing in silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since rival fac@@ tions struggle to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of tin , two @-@ storey de@@ vil@@ s for drug king@@ doms that are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; remember for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; tranqu@@ ility &quot; &quot; when only a lamp control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs trade routes to the United States . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , had broken his friend not to protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to murder .
&quot; at first , there was the publication of a interview with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ els in war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the children , suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country to its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
&quot; he had so long survived his friends and colleagues , that he would always be there . &quot;
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare H@@ ogan Lov@@ ells
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without viol@@ ating the drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with the time , the newspaper earned a reputation for cour@@ age@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved it hard @-@ to @-@ use investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever she did . &quot;
he volun@@ tar@@ ily gave him that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue , &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J . &quot;
&quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you must take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team was missing Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ß@@ vo@@ gel who was able to curse the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite to the office , and there always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; was his love for the routine his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and run@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
&quot; if it is wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days previously known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , has been used for surveillance of journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
there were two polic@@ emen seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ range district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the Scher@@ z , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who called the govern@@ or himself as non @-@ tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs de fac@@ to are under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has bent on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known pit of Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an exposure to the government spending , which concentrated on the hom@@ et@@ own of the govern@@ or . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the state office , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped , or as it happened , so was careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , controlled almost the whole century all political levels . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of top @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this loc@@ ale , among them one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the readers would have seen the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had already known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of its slim body structure . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez became a storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something that they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; in the next morning , Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped up a few signs and went to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the state office . &quot;
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his . &quot;
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der in the organized protests &quot; &quot; SOS Press &quot; &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot;
this day is the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez weg in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
&quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and bring them to them because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked her to re @-@ enter by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt their objec@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , which involved governmental officers and a &quot; &quot; society &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces that were organised with the organised crime under a blanket . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you do , because they want you keep the mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
no one for@@ gets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as in six years ago .
&quot; her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kartell , &quot; &quot; here I am due to my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones are located next to their separate head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of their directors in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly set up the drug cart@@ on with a editorial on the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists fled from their home countries or even fled from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe roads and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ den@@ ced by the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay back and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the drug trade is terri@@ fied by the fact that the drug trade is terri@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became a reporter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their teleph@@ ones began to sum@@ mon . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ots with Band@@ en@@ rival and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further as it was promised by a number of Kartell messages in the region .
&quot; from the Bord@@ stein@@ edge , they released the news on the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce website on mobile phone . &quot;
the page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ul@@ led near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept the guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they didn &apos;t show it . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps . &quot;
&quot; how can you think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when the same day , J@@ avier was murdered , the intern@@ s asked me to send them to the road . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ aking to avoid its enemies
&quot; on the first glance , it looks like a statue , if a fri@@ ghtening . &quot;
&quot; now , researchers found that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mining worker have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even notice that his sli@@ pp@@ y skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said they would have had something of a &quot; &quot; quiet past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology , &quot; described him as &quot; the be@@ amed din@@ osau@@ rs , ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ossi@@ l is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er , which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years . &quot;
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved state , researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the arm@@ ored plant @-@ fres@@ ser is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look closely . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pound ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth@@ umping . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just blin@@ ds a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has been s@@ laugh@@ tered , &quot; &quot; said the author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
it will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of din@@ osau@@ rs .
&quot; researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage , to hide themselves from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ ach@@ ute technique known as counter @-@ att@@ ung , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have been allowed to mix well into his environment and avoid its enemies , say experts , indicating that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old Cre@@ ature from the family of No@@ dos@@ kop has made head@@ lines in May and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it was named B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ .000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and shape of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
&quot; they discovered the con@@ sh@@ aded , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature darker was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the con@@ stell@@ ations are common , the results are surprisingly , as the size of B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far away from the living animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that din@@ osau@@ rs have been hun@@ ted by eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution fav@@ oured the confron@@ tation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ aded - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable as sp@@ oil , which signal that this no@@ dos@@ cope was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dator behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs have to have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red @-@ brown .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life , including his conservative Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , went into a river and went out into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at this time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oc@@ eans probably spread far more inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ stal@@ osau@@ r is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ served @-@ formed skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintaining the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly like in the early cycle time .
&quot; you don &apos;t need a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is at the sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ lanes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , who stood on two legs , the earth went through . &quot;
&quot; although the King of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear , believe that B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta failed after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the be@@ arded din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were weigh@@ ed about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it included two 20 @-@ inch long tips drawn from his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant @-@ fres@@ ser was w@@ asted by Western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater ref@@ unds of the din@@ osau@@ rs kept its ma@@ ker@@ e@@ ady in exquisite details .
&quot; the remains of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the door panels are still covered along the din@@ osau@@ rs along the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a profit in the lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I get it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of the skin still cover the hol@@ low@@ ish arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right foot rests on his side , his five fingers are stretched upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales at its sole .

it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced it : nothing will sit in the train and sleep .
or you &apos;re deeper into his work and has just a brilliant thought .

&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; is the ticket for ticket sales without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use , however , some prerequis@@ ites have to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; by Andrzej On February 8 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets , &lt; 7 &quot; &quot; Tablets , Android &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works as follows : one climb@@ s into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in case of test customers , then a button for the electronic de@@ valuation will appear . &quot;
the train companion gets on their mobile devices a message that passenger X is located in the train and taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; when the ticket insp@@ ector is placed in place Y , he knows that a passenger is sitting there with already de@@ valued online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can go to sleep , continue to keep silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn will take advantage of passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to be relaxed without a ticket inspection by our train staff , the DB Navigator is simply aw@@ ak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; this allows passengers to person@@ alize their travel time in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Executive Board of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to meet individual customer needs .
&quot; who often drives train , knows that in addition to delays and missed trains the ticket insp@@ ections are among the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; but in any case , one of the members does not have all the documents that you need for de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or the ID card or a document , which you have to pre@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the section or large room and delays in control of your own tickets and take the Schaff@@ ner at the end of time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .

&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and there is still on the street , &quot; he called it there . &quot;

a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly wor@@ shipped on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the R@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed . &quot;
&quot; he sent a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ fty body , which was stretched out on the street and stay there for four hours . &quot;
&quot; this is a wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her mobile phone to return later on the evening to tweets about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos from the police band and people who cried , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns father who claimed a sign with the in@@ scription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , she escaped another polic@@ eman and cried : &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the type of murder we have used to and which we can call .
at this moment I felt sh@@ aking ch@@ ills .
I was angry and we@@ pt .
she booked a return flight and went home at the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she picked her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter out of her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what has happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; theatrical Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinem@@ as from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance which consists of the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to ask answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , and that was not correct . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them away , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot;
what is happening today is a cli@@ max of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only ac@@ tivis@@ m and organization but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have luck to give you an experience , in which they personally do not experience an ec@@ centric racism , it is not different than the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I feel that I would prove her a bad service , to keep them away from them . &quot;
&quot; the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , located at the South of Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority designated to a camp , when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of officers Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business partner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped them to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began a new type of ac@@ tivis@@ m for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my ac@@ tivis@@ m has changed after August 9th , she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on Essen@@ tial Justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot;
it &apos;s all come .
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to document &quot; document , &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; do you document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism has been nour@@ ished by countless instances of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an said recently in an interview , &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field that is known for his share vis@@ m around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt @-@ Ins@@ assen . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rell to the project , together with six other local n@@ atives followed the team of &quot; www.gstadt.de Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the aim was not to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s experience - to show that it is not about a Messi@@ ah leader , but rather a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved itself as the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , docum@@ ent@@ aries reveal documents from &quot; DIY Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s life , as they marry in love and her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work , and in the human form of black people . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Matter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have influenced the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ Li@@ es@@ Matter &quot; &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly struggling with different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women have to wear the main load of all . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , she insi@@ sted that &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; it was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s no coinci@@ dence , although it was at the for@@ efront of the front , because in a life of these cros@@ sings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen .
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long gone missing , but the rac@@ ist links between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on fire for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway for a demonstration .
it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; however , they cling to a song and they feel committed to this memory since they went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on for three years . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains .

&quot; in addition , the gallery will be placed on the grounds on which the farm market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the start of the construction work , it will be a conclusion . &quot;
&quot; the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building , namely Bed@@ a Square with possibility to sit outside . &quot;
&quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; we have been buying almost every week in the farm market for many years . &quot;
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lords are always very happy . &quot;
we have discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would like to wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , it is also possible . &quot;
&quot; above all , the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;

there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many shop stores are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since it is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the commodity prices are fresh , it is mostly offered directly from the producer and is ob@@ tain@@ able . &quot;
&quot; as one sees , shop@@ pers are rented in a shopping centre only of larger companies , because they are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; a pity , special transactions are almost no more and what is left of it will also disappear . &quot;
&quot; Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me . &quot;
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all , where is the farm market hall during the construction period ? &quot;
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does the Ges@@ pen@@ st Bit @-@ Gallery already manage to sell all stores from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will not work .
&quot; and a shopping center that stands empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real peasant market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer @-@ market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess building projects in Bit@@ burg no place more . &quot;
&quot; when the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible - which hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ lem that were sent by Chelsea M@@ anning .
&quot; M@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ av@@ en@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st banned a 35 @-@ year sentence after it publicly made diplomatic messages about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A B@@ ecom@@ ing Terror blan@@ ce ( A matching resem@@ blan@@ ce ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combines its expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ gender and pioneering dis@@ sident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he was only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted by M@@ anning extract and created out of the 30 portraits as someone could be interpreted with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted , and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning , born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has been convic@@ ted as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty has been convic@@ ted of 20 charges , including six violations of the spy law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison , her picture was supp@@ ressed , so very that it was only a single photo - a gran@@ ni@@ cal , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in the M@@ anning visi@@ bly un@@ comfortable on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with whom she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg moved from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigar@@ ette numbers and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um by extrac@@ ting DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look like . &quot;
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she couldn &apos;t visit this time and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed , so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her deta@@ ined M@@ use became un@@ equal in Bri@@ eff@@ i who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated comic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; , &quot; which would predict a future in which the president Chel@@ ten jud@@ ging judgment would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happ@@ ier meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something Deep and St@@ ark@@ es , da Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fix the sti@@ ff spl@@ its that it should actually remedy . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery , M@@ anning called called M@@ anning with her over@@ sized signature , including the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in her family name is equipped with a heart ) at the end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , their basis sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides after the highly developed scientific glos@@ s@@ ary of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in a biological sense , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome does not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in its own room , is one side of the comic @-@ no@@ vel@@ le mentioned above . &quot;
it shows M@@ anning as she emerg@@ es with a Frei@@ sp@@ ri@@ el@@ ef@@ on in his hand from the discipline of discipline of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; if they are cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who sal@@ utes from Philadelphia . &quot;
I always get go@@ ose when I speak about it .
&quot; M@@ anning has not yet seen the exhibition yet - as it was fores@@ een in the Com@@ ic@@ book - but when it was supposed to do it , it will be gre@@ eted in the middle of the room from the masks , of their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ations , like hor@@ des of prot@@ agoni@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; it was also focused on how everything was done in the exhibition , until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ log groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed in Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
&quot; in the G@@ ange for a professor at the North@@ western University and a staff of the University of Oxford , who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the Cook County Court . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bul@@ lets . &quot;
&quot; a warning system issued by the Chicago Police Authority , states that the Lei@@ che was discovered on July 27 . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still explained to the place of events for dead , and det@@ ectives investigating the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are looking for the two susp@@ ects . &quot;
she has been an extraordinary professor for micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ b@@ age , Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail explaining that La@@ adan is now being evaluated and excluded from the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal affair , which is examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ b@@ age . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokesman for the University and the Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK in contact and ready to assist U.S. investig@@ ators in every concei@@ vable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and wanted that he presented himself .
&quot; chief Communications Officer at the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he demands the susp@@ ects to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the suspect . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building that had just had a pu@@ zzling hint that had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .

it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the residents : &quot; &quot; the police currently works at the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motifs , including a possible domestic occurrence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the W@@ AD@@ A timet@@ able in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot;
&quot; the Russian Deputy Re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) will be implemented for the restoration of Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( Rous@@ ada ) . &quot;
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the timet@@ able , Rus@@ ada has the right to plan and test in collaboration with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ AD@@ A timet@@ able was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the W@@ AD@@ A timet@@ able to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for re@@ deployment of Rus@@ ada and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he has nothing to give concern for Russia &apos;s cause . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the W@@ AD@@ A in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list stated , however , that the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing authorities have to accept the reported results from AD@@ A approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly accept state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in regards to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has a fault . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with Russian sales agency , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems to the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , Rus@@ ada was excluded in the course of dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als from the W@@ AD@@ A from conducting dop@@ ing controls in Russia . &quot;
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ AD@@ A General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli explained that Rus@@ ada moved into the right direction , to be used again . &quot;

a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; due to the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment , it enables companies to address surveys , specific groups and demo@@ graphical groups , to address employees an@@ onym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow the C @-@ Suite executives to deal directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure their commitment . &quot;
he said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a heat map of the company that shows which units have most complaints and which executives have low added results - so you can drill down why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you will not be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post , which describes a environment of matters in which those who have spoken were punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;

&quot; if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often an inti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good opportunity to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company Conver@@ cent use it , problems that were previously identified by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , discrimination or un@@ solic@@ ited intern@@ ships can be identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view in experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who is the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;

&quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; that companies knew that they could not prevent that their dirty laundry went online . &quot;

both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ ters offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .

&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than now .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only inserts . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices heard , and that the work that you do is worth it , then feel strongly committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Finance and Employ@@ ee Experience at LinkedIn , who used both Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach ren@@ ders when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third promise , commitment and commitment to the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on the employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
&quot; however , the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take action . &quot;
&quot; indeed , if a company asks for your feedback , it may have an expect@@ ation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or at all , this dis@@ appointments can breed and de@@ motiv@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have left on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow our employees , &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about yourself ?
&quot; and if you do not care about why , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Madi@@ son Reed , who is now through monthly staff surveys , was able to guide measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback of frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in a long term , this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high revenues . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two days practice and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it goes on at 23 : 00 when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers talk on one side of the new training areas of the team on campus .
some have moved their tri@@ kot@@ off parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break . &quot;
&quot; players who are written in the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final examinations , before they return to the Water@@ man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real Tre@@ t@@ mühle , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 AM in order to meet the already packed sched@@ ules of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , where the Bru@@ ins moved to the beginning of the camps almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
&quot; in the course of August 18 exercises , they will take place at the beginning of the formal game preparation for their pre@@ lude to Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said he supported the change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they added the multiple @-@ employed routes of the player another point . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it down , they pl@@ aten themselves , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which has already been disc@@ arded by the clear sight@@ line of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already been subject to foot@@ balls , which will be no easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a ro@@ cked out that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people will rent a room and then set it up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video player from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t like to worry too much .

creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his recent past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a gor@@ ge for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 and 1980 . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Main@@ l River Valley in Kent and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; &quot; a Castle in England &quot; ren@@ ders the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac steering ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on a archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he un@@ expect@@ edly found . &quot;
&quot; I just re@@ acted on the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb @-@ print ! &quot;
&quot; and letters smell of smoke , because at that time you burned a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives in the age of 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself is also doing it . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated &quot; &quot; ) this all seems to be true to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives , and to study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ ed Hy@@ än@@ gl@@ ets on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape managers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked in the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; whis@@ key &quot; &quot; and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust only received the full access when the last one , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; as Rho@@ des a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristo@@ crats said &quot; Oh , wir@@ ls it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one could think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought two families . &quot;
go to the top of the page
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on a wider base in the English history , including &apos; The lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves the newly built castle to join the farmhouse from 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a revol@@ t that entered 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &quot; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of Kent and Sus@@ sex &quot; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought , an insur@@ rection was a good beginning . &quot;
maybe the two are connected together ?
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ cher that the family Dar@@ rell was hidden for seven years during the English Reformation .
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mug@@ gl@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rell was staged from the 18th century , staged his own funeral , filled with stones ( a discovery which was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family from Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite Ga@@ uner , and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men sol@@ sten their debt crises by mar@@ ching rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise . &quot;
&quot; after the end of its use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique scre@@ am experiences &quot;
&quot; it has a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about el@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki behind itself , the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has been re@@ leg@@ ated from nature again . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be done with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;

military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ ogan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es on boarding and transport in officers . &quot;
this week .
&quot; on the first glance , a normal operation . &quot;
&quot; however , nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the general letter , as previously , but in the minist@@ erial position of Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the Heads of State , the five Deputy Prime Minister , as well as the Minister for Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; in this way , civilians in the Y@@ as were in the majority . &quot;
the government with@@ draws the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar Chief of Staff , however , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the military forces and the navy have been dismis@@ sed . &quot;

&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - usually due to alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ il Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ ogan as a wi@@ dow of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 48@@ 6 people who have been involved in the coup attempt , will be negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup , Erd@@ ogan had described the crash test as &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; , &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but Erd@@ ogan really has a grip on the army ?
&quot; in the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article with the heading &quot; dis@@ comfort in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there is concern for an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the aboli@@ tion of the head@@ scarf ban on female soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the army and the security forces continue at any rate . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ ogan sent other 73@@ 95 heads , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it seemed , when Erd@@ ogan had t@@ amed the military . &quot;
the gener@@ als were used earlier than the actual lords of the country .
three times they were calling on their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the secular state .
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 Erd@@ ogan urged the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reforms of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erd@@ ogan targets a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; a particular not @-@ named officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years . &quot;

Washington changes rules for Green Card
&quot; it will give a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; he looks ahead to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill will be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers , and will do this by modi@@ fying the United States as citizens from other countries Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that are good to our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;

the asc@@ en@@ sion of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought that 2017 can &apos;t be even crazy , a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , em@@ eri@@ zed professor for robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascent seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples and the type of finger nail . &quot;
&quot; people are fun about them , but the companies deliver any amount of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ffs have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone membrane that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to its beliefs , and choose everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot via the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the colour of its f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is still more distur@@ bing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would look progressive like a Step@@ ford woman . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ sts have developed to robots with a silicone membrane .
&quot; the Real@@ Bot@@ ix Robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties that they like , such as Schü@@ le tern@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of Schü@@ le tern@@ ity and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is tailored to your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Comp@@ an@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you do not like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people ! &quot;
&quot; it can be we@@ ary , on conversation , or it can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive feminine properties , the attacks on rape when one step onto Fri@@ gi@@ d ( says here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah is going , rest@@ less one most . &quot;
&quot; true Comp@@ an@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; it &apos;s on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their creation and growing refin@@ ement are pointing to something Dun@@ ks and Ti@@ efer@@ es in our culture , based on a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men are of course no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their growing popularity , they nevertheless remain provis@@ ional at the br@@ ink of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what is le@@ ak@@ ened out of the marginal zones can be related to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or offensive , until they are granted permission to them . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots in a time appear in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened in which there is a pre@@ sidents in which there is a pre@@ sidents in the White House to have sex sex@@ ually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the most horrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the forced body and the out@@ stretched eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it doesn &apos;t feel like a big jump . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ blan@@ ce to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their builders want them to feel hum@@ bly that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , at the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are no real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companions or simply go away .
&quot; they do not have mediation or a background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are fake slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the words of 2017 : maid service

he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of the common sense of human rights
&quot; it has become a bin@@ sign@@ ment of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era , that political spl@@ its that have pol@@ arized US voters also split families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving , there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ selectable relatives . &quot;
we strongly urge all suppos@@ edly to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , to bring families together . &quot;
&quot; I mentioned this because my c@@ ous@@ ins , a left @-@ headed poet , lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , who visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that the unity of a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; the dining table is certainly a good thing , but it falls in a further context that this also leads to considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the final effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ati@@ fying possibility that his bi@@ bs will no longer be broken . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing . &quot;
&quot; today , I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ prising version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration saw ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact as very mild off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; if Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of Republi@@ can only be mentally healthy to qualify as an un@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ous@@ ins were in the city , we brought our children to the carousel of the Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a c@@ aff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals are turning to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ atic music im@@ parts this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I still have not been across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the topics @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magic experience here , since here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 years of age and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could rate the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but luckily nobody was asked . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to buy the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the charging table . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ ing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ poses pressure on the servers to put personality into a situation where there is no need . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars . &quot;

&quot; he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of the Valentine &apos;s Day , by giving them several times through a door of the toil@@ et@@ racks in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria . &quot;

the position is already written - suitable candidates are rare .
&quot; for the past 31 years , W@@ acker &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister . &quot;
&quot; and the work makes him still great fun , as he pre@@ fers in the press . &quot;
&quot; he reports of diverse , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his followers . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it amaz@@ es him that so far , no application has been fulfilled . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the next time .
&quot; in case of regular dism@@ iss@@ al periods , there will be enough time for a revision . &quot;

&quot; you can move much , &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the gre@@ enh@@ ouses will often be mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;

&quot; also that his successor is long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really want to identify and stay in place with the place . &quot;
&quot; for continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;

&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to alle@@ vi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your di@@ ges@@ tive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; however , a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the inc@@ urable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK , causes stomach cr@@ amps and paraly@@ sis , recur@@ ring or bloody di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University discovered that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
&quot; the conduc@@ tive researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol in order to ensure that dam@@ aging micro@@ bes , which hide in the food , do not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to trigger inflammation , are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissue . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , this may result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments were found that a kind of tolerance promoting immun@@ ity is common in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their in@@ wards .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ il@@ lus reu@@ ter@@ i - that is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mili@@ eus , if the same system is also wir@@ y in humans . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immun@@ ity that promoted the tolerance when it came out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had been separately accommod@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference between the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ oms of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that usually live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced , and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without them lacking in mice . &quot;
mice were found in a ster@@ ile environment so that they did not have a gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not developed this kind of immune cells and they got the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how bacteria react to the immune system , the researchers found L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; as the active component of the liquid was puri@@ fied , it proved itself as a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers had doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the lining of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ als were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same toler@@ able cells such as mice that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells in humans such as mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in humans with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potential can lead high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ es in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an expansion of this population .

&quot; I will continue to examine such Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
but there is also a role as to whether in the planned area there is interest to rehab@@ ilit@@ ate .
&quot; if necessary , the regional boundaries could also move again again . &quot;
&quot; the STE@@ G represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;

&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , which means per plot . &quot;

the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yers of thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a navy helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that raises American manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pa@@ yers to the information of the military that have been left to the TIME magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 , in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House , made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , the helicopter was built next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or fra@@ go , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , following the records of the helicopter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to know that you are aware of it because it &apos;s an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his su@@ peri@@ ority , the deputy naval officer for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long until the rab@@ bit was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 . &quot;
the note adds that if the withdrawal from the White House should be delayed because of the restriction of the hours a second team would be needed for the return flight .
the original air@@ plane was during the event during the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time .
the recordings provided by the TIME provided no clear whether a second flight of flight was required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could hurt the destiny .
&quot; a question we presented was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; the deputy commander answered . &quot;
&quot; the event &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; was called the White House as an official event and would not be covered by H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an impulse for the reform of the health reform that was in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to damp@@ en government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February , when the presidential aircraft was in front of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compla@@ ined about the use of the Presi@@ dential air@@ plane through its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in South La@@ wn , to cancel the US president in the White House with precise cen@@ timet@@ ers@@ . &quot;
&quot; as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led the White House 58 exercise land@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted among the training needs of the flight schedule for the month , said an official . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pa@@ yers did not have the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps held at the event .
a spokesman for S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not stop bud@@ get@@ ing records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ ze of the Ministry of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D rei@@ mbur@@ sement of the V@@ H @-@ 3D however amounted to 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air facility in Virginia .
the White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicop@@ ters are far below this rate .

&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the rei@@ mbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time the former press secretary of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America , &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot;

&quot; the city runs 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 , the children receive a warm meal at lunch time . &quot;
&quot; last year , 28@@ 00 children sat in the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who will be looked after 45 hours in the K@@ ita , explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care , if children stay up to 14 . &quot;

the direct connection of the co@@ ke @-@ power to the team is sensible .

&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .

&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - apart from the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , it is also the charm that they have seen in the cost comparison between self @-@ governing and foreign policy for the city as the most economical . &quot;

&quot; generations of families have been working here and the workers concentrate on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot;

did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned in front of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?

&quot; in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave after a quot@@ ation of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve its release clause , but have warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record crash ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and for the highest paid professional ath@@ l@@ ete in the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;

but the football world was warned about three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this view ?
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .

&quot; PS@@ G made clear that it could not permit the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prices for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; sum@@ ming up , that by Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the punishment for the student could also fall sharp@@ ly for the students . &quot;
&quot; however , contrary to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims are estimated that many victims are estimated to be the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories with him . &quot;

how do you evaluate as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : when you read the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is common in it . &quot;
he is just eight pages dedicated and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the medi@@ a@@ eval or co @-@ wit@@ ty in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
also the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school took place outside of its sphere of activity .
&quot; if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact us at any time . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all the respon@@ dents - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also provides an excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good teachers who regularly supplied the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ined about his perf@@ ection@@ ism and his high emotional content , which also led to W@@ ut@@ o@@ qu@@ arri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; that he did not only kn@@ it with chairs and bow@@ ls on the ground , but also released ear files and too fre@@ aking guys on the hair or ears , he has been deeply regre@@ tt@@ ed and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; to his honor@@ ary rescue , however , it must be said that such educational methods have been widely used in the fra@@ ction period , the 1960s and the 1970s , with parents as with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each of us was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also have experienced this in a secular school , a state school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the use of violence at the pre @-@ school , it is of course Bag@@ at@@ ella . &quot;
&quot; there is no doubt whether it is not more familiar with his fame and role as the brother of Benedict XVI , that many media have just collap@@ sed on him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e there are many who never understood him , still eag@@ erly . &quot;
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report , a lot about the topic of abuse at Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was reported . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also have some winding or compassion in view of sexual abuse to load ? &quot;
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : quite clearly .
no one of 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entru@@ sted the cathedral master .
not even the parents were so@@ aked .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said a spokesman for the others , &quot; &quot; It was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the true problem in the enlighten@@ ment of sexual abuse has been and is that most of the victims are silent .
&quot; if they don &apos;t even trust parents and brothers , then certainly not a choir director who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ r@@ ator . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students vote of R@@ atz@@ inger role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it : &quot; regarding sexual mis@@ use ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he would have had timely insights and could have been able to hold the relevant perpet@@ r@@ ators .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd , to assume that ... bub@@ bles are intru@@ sive or more clear or more likely to be opened as opposed to their parents , dor@@ mit@@ ories , trust instruc@@ tors , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able .
&quot; in this way , the report comes to the very clear outcome : &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment were entru@@ sted to him , could not be confirmed in the scope of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore acqu@@ itted of any co @-@ ordin@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it cannot be thrown to him not to be prevented or brought to the advertisement . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; signs &quot; . &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the great problem that in the reporting , everything mixed and wor@@ sen@@ ed to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but precisely this is a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; there will be clean separate : between the pre @-@ school and the Gymnasium of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence and , we say , other accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report incidents from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir director of the cathedral @-@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful rehear@@ sal ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers have been sub@@ stituted and painted , were all involved in the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be observed . &quot;
&quot; however , with which Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boys first to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ agli@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , how most of the witnesses emphasize , the theme &quot; &quot; Primary School &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was only happy to be able to escape , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; conditions . &quot;
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was discipline , but not a sa@@ di@@ stic power . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , with which the report concluded that &quot; many victims of the general humanity of R. were estimated and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories with him . &quot;

&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states on the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and of the courses at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( as the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again in 1993 . &quot;
do you want to report this message ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um who even re@@ produces the report . &quot;
he points his finger at you and fri@@ ghtening music plays .

&quot; this was of course at a point of time , as a legal clarity , as exam@@ in@@ ers were also banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they occurred in a legal gray zone , as everyone knows from us . &quot;
&quot; it was also hard to estimate for him , where the people might possibly exagger@@ ate or dram@@ ati@@ sed , and where really the per@@ missible limit was exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can &apos;t say , it would have been swe@@ pt away . &quot;
this is just not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test sentence of schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria . &quot;
it is unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the time of time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; which is the danger of evaluating the past after today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;

&quot; but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and not for what was banned in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ vers@@ aries and violence against innocent children of children , that goes far beyond that . &quot;
this is all very terrible and I &apos;m glad that it is finally up .
&quot; but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for discipline and punishment , i.e. ear files and hair and ears , were widespread in the 197@@ 0@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , he has kept strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; which picture from his Reg@@ ens@@ burger Zeit , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
do you want to report this message ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI , tells of his perspective , the cathedral spar@@ rows played only a side role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I don &apos;t know that he led a strict regim@@ ent there . &quot;
&quot; but also this must be said : without this perf@@ ection@@ ism without the demand un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible to form a institution of pupp@@ y , true cultural amb@@ ass@@ adors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went to the USA twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not make a big singer and before every success , just on which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ hyp@@ nosis . &quot;
&quot; as what for a man , you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in conversations with her book ? &quot;
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and always experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , underlying , deeply believing and heart@@ felt people from which one could not imagine that he could only do a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly receive , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ ding , visit him , visit him , he is almost blind - and like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strictly to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most domains are grateful to him today that he en@@ riches their lives and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , v@@ acious teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a lovely respect for respect to which she is still alive today and that they are almost rever@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that you pre@@ ach to him , are educational methods that were at the time of the day . &quot;
we can be happy that we have overcome these times .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because it is promin@@ ently prominent and a more prominent brother , to medit@@ ate for the medi@@ al sin@@ ner . &quot;
it is the evil intent that stands behind it is only too obvious .
&quot; for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now it would be possible to have a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside Bavaria , and perhaps Germany probably wouldn &apos;t even know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
