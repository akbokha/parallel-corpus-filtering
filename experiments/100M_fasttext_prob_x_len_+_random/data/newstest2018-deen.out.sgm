<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate this as well as any other, therefore, the sorely staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he was a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the President to drastically limit the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller didn't handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have suffered him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he intervened with its meaning, and in particular the significance that it was written when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta said:" "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you refer to, was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it's about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not just invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elende waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicans by showing the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they themselves are a very different name: mother of Exilists.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly like Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argues that the Statue of Liberty is not a lad, but rather an early Neoconservative that the American flame goes to the surrounding world:" "Lady Liberty is going forward."</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Pretty unusual is Limbaugh found here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see how it was seen from the inexhaustible, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys to the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump have ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="127">"her torch is not to illuminate the way, but hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>

<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs in their quest for success had increased enormously, effectively cheating and risked to ruin when banks or owners returned their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP dropped from concentration on the debt of clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>

<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could be sponsoring the PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income."</seg>

<seg id="1317">Life live: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court Apartment into a generous home.</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, spent in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">"it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace, and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags."</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I was searching for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"this apartment was shown in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">"I have been in love with them, and made an offer on this day."</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a welded layout - one had to go through the kitchen to enter into the bedroom - wanted to add a storage room and an mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, they commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill who had 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms overlapping each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine, where one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Fan had to think creative in order to resolve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on each other without having to bother ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled the fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classical copper light window of Retrouvius can look down over the glamorous residential area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"you will find these under" "Tools, Internet Options, Security" "and" "Tools, Internet Options, Privacy". ""</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow him to work for longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen feel the reflection like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The entrance offer mirrored units space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering," Erfan explains from the steel reinforcing, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is important, so that when you push the door very easily, very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could win additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or as your property is estimated," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate broker will enter a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and that will help you create an emotional binding in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "you don't love you into the electrical sockets in the walls."</seg>

<seg id="1356">"two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dynastie, in a confrontation with one of the largest real estate corporations in Victorias in the value of more than 500 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the 'Carlton-Football-Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties in value of more than half a billion dollars, since the family had bought a store in Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now comprises offices in the town zenrum, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburb."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul as" "principal provider and the dominant personality" "in the family De Lutis - about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court records that this means that Colin's property has a value of 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash money has been shown for Paul as a challenge point for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin proposed to leave him with what I held for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims to be excluded."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues, this is not true, but throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says, he hope to put the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian inheritance claims that the family is the most important priority," "he wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950's and bought a shop in Brunswick.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the safety to buy the Collingwood properties where Colin opened the first Jeansk family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">"Colin says that he started West co when he was" in my last years of the High School, when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old). "</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property to their sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers before judgment," "she wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis Group, with Colin claims that Mark when leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars were paid."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"Luke as well as Mark, Paul said above the conditions of its financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="1380">"Colin has maintained himself very well, although he was a former AFL member of the board and after a biography from the year 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV stars."</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media participated in Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"just Colin answered by SMS, to say" I cannot say much, "because the case is before the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw up our family names through the dishes," "he wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1384">"in mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother."</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," "he said, and added that he was still hoping for a solution."</seg>

<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small zikade, a microbacterium, transmitted to the dwarf, and with very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>

<seg id="1802">"lavender oil attracts not only for holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics."</seg>
<seg id="1803">"Eric Chaisse said:" "instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened."</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil.</seg>
<seg id="1805">"the solutions that are taken into consideration include a better water distribution and slowing of evaporation from the soil, but also the sprinkling of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resilient to drought."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally arrive on Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and unobtrusive drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what is safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporter, to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and panties."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest from violence, and while throughout the country the corpses accumulate, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto joined his office in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, her editor and her inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although in 2010 a Sonder's Office was established in order to process the cases of journalists, this was initiated by the Committee for Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders, each year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still continue to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are intrinsically and even though the terrain is still more trapped."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting to discuss security is little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why, we are misguided."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of 15 May, Valdez was leaving the newspaper Riodoce in the province capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was forced out of two men, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" "Zwölfter River". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The hat went away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on Valdez, there is practically nothing in silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of tin, two-storey devils for drug kingdoms that are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"remember for a minute that there is a state of" "tranquility" "when only a lamp control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drugs trade routes to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, had broken his friend not to protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"at first, there was the publication of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartels in war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the children, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">"he had so long survived his friends and colleagues, that he would always be there."</seg>
<seg id="1845">Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare Hogan Lovells</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to operate journalism without violating the drug problem," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it hard-to-use investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Award "for their coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever she did."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily gave him that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue," he said at the time of CPJ. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You must take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dummy.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked:" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not tell what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team was missing Valdez, the Spaßvogel who was able to curse the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite to the office, and there always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask," "was his love for the routine his ruin?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and runways."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it is wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days previously known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, has been used for surveillance of journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">There were two policemen seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-range district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the Scherz, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who called the governor himself as non-trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs de facto are under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce has bent on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known pit of Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposure to the government spending, which concentrated on the hometown of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the state office, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped, or as it happened, so was careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), controlled almost the whole century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of top-caliber cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locale, among them one where a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the readers would have seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source of the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past, we had already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body structure. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez became a storage space for signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something that they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">"in the next morning, Miriam Ramirez snapped up a few signs and went to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the state office."</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country, journalists have become louder in the organized protests" "SOS Press" "on pavements and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">This day is the director Bojorquez weg in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and bring them to them because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked her to re-enter by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, which involved governmental officers and a" "society". ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces that were organised with the organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"in the past year, the media group" Articulo 19 "has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you do, because they want you keep the mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas in six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by Zetas-Kartell," "here I am due to my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones are located next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua, after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their directors in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly set up the drug carton with a editorial on the title" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists fled from their home countries or even fled from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe roads and search for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidenced by the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay back and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"in fact, the drug trade is terrified by the fact that the drug trade is terrified."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I became a reporter," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their telephones began to summon."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shoots with Bandenrival and security forces near the Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated further as it was promised by a number of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the Bordsteinedge, they released the news on the Riodoce website on mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens heulled near - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who kept the guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they didn't show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you think about it," "said Bojorquez," "when the same day, Javier was murdered, the interns asked me to send them to the road."</seg>

<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-fresser is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pound (1.100 kg) heavy earthumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blinds a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has been slaughtered," "said the author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant-eaters, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage, to hide themselves from predators, and used a parachute technique known as counter-attung, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have been allowed to mix well into his environment and avoid its enemies, say experts, indicating that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old Creature from the family of Nodoskop has made headlines in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it was named Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7.000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and shape of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the conshaded, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature darker was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the constellations are common, the results are surprisingly, as the size of Borealopelta is far away from the living animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that dinosaurs have been hunted by eating dinosaurs, that the evolution favoured the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter shaded - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable as spoil, which signal that this nodoscope was exposed to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs have to have been the chalk time," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life, including his conservative Darminhaltes, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, went into a river and went out into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at this time Alberta was as warm as southern fluorida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nostalosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved-formed skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintaining the original shape of the animal," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal today looks almost exactly like in the early cycle time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you're just a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is at the sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when huge theroplanes, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, the earth went through."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the King of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaurs were hunted by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear, believe that Borealopelta failed after death in the sea and was mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the bearded dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were weighed about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It included two 20-inch long tips drawn from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armoured plant-fresser was wasted by Western Canada, until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater refunds of the dinosaurs kept its makeready in exquisite details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the remains of this special specimen are so well preserved, that the door panels are still covered along the dinosaurs along the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a profit in the lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I get it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the hollowish armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>

<seg id="2583">Researchers at the Washingtoner University discovered that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the conductive researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the intestine patrol in order to ensure that damaging microbes, which hide in the food, do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to trigger inflammation, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissue."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, this may result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments were found that a kind of tolerance promoting immunity is common in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their inwards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of Tryptophan rich diet tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system is also wiry in humans."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immunity that promoted the tolerance when it came out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had been separately accommodated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspected that the difference between the intestinal microbioms of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice were DNA sequenced, and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without them lacking in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were found in a sterile environment so that they did not have a gut microbiome and they did not developed this kind of immune cells and they got the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how bacteria react to the immune system, the researchers found L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the liquid was purified, it proved itself as a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers had doubled the amount of tryptophan in the lining of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophanals were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerable cells such as mice that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans such as mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potential can lead high tryptophanes in the presence of L. reuteri to an expansion of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "says Hesemann," "for all that had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>

<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: when you read the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is common in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just eight pages dedicated and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of the mediaeval or co-witty in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the violence of violence at the pre-school took place outside of its sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at any time."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all the respondents - literally -" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also provides an excellent testimony," "sincere," "sincere," "sincere", "" sincere "," "sincere", "" sincere "and" understanding, "as extremely good teachers who regularly supplied the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and" always surrounded by the grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotional content, which also led to Wutoquarries."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only knit with chairs and bowls on the ground, but also released ear files and too freaking guys on the hair or ears, he has been deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his honorary rescue, however, it must be said that such educational methods have been widely used in the fraction period, the 1960s and the 1970s, with parents as with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each of us was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also have experienced this in a secular school, a state school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the use of violence at the pre-school, it is of course Bagatella."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"there is no doubt whether it is not more familiar with his fame and role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just collapsed on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope there are many who never understood him, still eagerly."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report, a lot about the topic of abuse at Regensburger Domspatzen was reported."</seg>
<seg id="2930">"in the final report, Georg Ratzinger will also have some winding or compassion in view of sexual abuse to load?"</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted the cathedral master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were soaked.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said a spokesman for the others," "It was very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem in the enlightenment of sexual abuse has been and is that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they don't even trust parents and brothers, then certainly not a choir director who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students vote of Ratzinger role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it: "regarding sexual misuse... I don't see any case in which he would have had timely insights and could have been able to hold the relevant perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd, to assume that... bubbles are intrusive or more clear or more likely to be opened as opposed to their parents, dormitories, trust instructors, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report comes to the very clear outcome:" "that the students and / or their environment were entrusted to him, could not be confirmed in the scope of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"what sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore acquitted of any co-ordinator."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, it cannot be thrown to him not to be prevented or brought to the advertisement."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media there was a lot of" "Violence" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "signs". ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem that in the reporting, everything mixed and worsened to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But precisely this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"there will be clean separate: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence and, we say, other accusations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report incidents from the time since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir director of the cathedral-atzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful rehearsal pedagogy, the cases where the boys of sadistic teachers have been substituted and painted, were all involved in the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to be observed."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"however, with which Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boys first to face when they were already on the Domspatzengagliasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on the one hand, how most of the witnesses emphasize, the theme" "Primary School". ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"it was only happy to be able to escape, and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" paradise "conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but not a sadistic power."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, with which the report concluded that" many victims of the general humanity of R. were estimated and therefore, in numerous cases, even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"(users Viewing this Forum: 1) 1,506 194 Tauchschein?"</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states on the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and of the courses at a school where he was not working and responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Do you want to report this message?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domatzengymnasium who even reproduces the report."</seg>

<seg id="2967">"before that, they occurred in a legal gray zone, as everyone knows from us."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was also hard to estimate for him, where the people might possibly exaggerate or dramatised, and where really the permissible limit was exceeded."</seg>

<seg id="2970">This is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test sentence of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">It is unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>

<seg id="2975">© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what was banned in the pre-school of adversaries and violence against innocent children of children, that goes far beyond that."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very terrible and I'm glad that it is finally up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger, for all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for discipline and punishment, i.e. ear files and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970ies."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he has kept strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which picture from his Regensburger Zeit, Georg Ratzinger, for the talks with you for the book" "My Brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Do you want to report this message?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, the cathedral sparrows played only a side role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I don't know that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but also this must be said: without this perfectionism without the demand unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible to form a institution of puppy, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went to the USA twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons alone, one does not make a big singer and before every success, just on which area, but always discipline, passion and self-hypnosis."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"as what for a man, you have experienced Georg Ratzinger in conversations with her book?"</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger and always experienced as wonderful, humorous, underlying, deeply believing and heartfelt people from which one could not imagine that he could only do a fly."</seg>
