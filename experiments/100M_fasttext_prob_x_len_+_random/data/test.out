&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfill certain tasks , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich are increased , says they . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;

&quot; oil production should also be possible in so far @-@ protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement will be announced . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand and demand the renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in the infrastructure - also at international trade agreements , both competitors are not too far away from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ acific trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the USA don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but just to protect American jobs . &quot;

the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a fam@@ ine .

&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage must be r@@ ushed , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the tax policy of both camps .

&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;

some of the children were certainly not voluntary .
many women were so used to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because the Sch@@ am is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often do not want to help , there is more accommodation for them , demands B@@ ahr . &quot;

&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there is something in the accommodation of the governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ians alone , women alone are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press secretary of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are some community shel@@ ters or houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bayern , there are two central accommodations only for women . &quot;
the Committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament ur@@ ges that women must be accommod@@ ated separately from men .
&quot; in a study which was published for the committee , it is : &quot; it is very important that men and women will be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or are accommod@@ ated men and women , it can come to - continued - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and for women easily accessible , stands in the study . &quot;

the representatives of the assist@@ ants have called their union to appro@@ ve new working conditions in their dispute with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has required his entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour amp@@ utation from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers would have given ministers to worry about the concerns regarding the contract .
&quot; in July , assist@@ ants and medical students have agreed upon the rejection of a contract that has been agreed with the B@@ MA . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chair@@ woman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained calm . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Executive Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and the official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as a response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Committee asked today a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating labour amp@@ f@@ measures , beginning in September . &quot;
the disputes led to the fact that assist@@ ants of this year were six@@ teen disputes and the first overall failure in the history of the N@@ HS .
the leader of the B@@ MA assistant physicians Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions imposed by the B@@ MA .
&quot; he told B@@ MA members during the sessions , which still took place before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be adv@@ an@@ tage@@ ous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; according to the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would inevitably be introduced . &quot;
&quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ ages &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and proc@@ laim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter @-@ player in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es , I cannot say that Ankara wants this reconciliation to most . &quot;
&quot; there was a hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile appeared , and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erd@@ ogan , on the other hand , talked about his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even be improved . &quot;
&quot; on the next day , a newspaper reported that Erd@@ ogan was so pleased that Erd@@ ogan would never have happened . &quot;
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
days of Moscow to Be Held in 2015 Moscow Mayor Serge@@ y Sob@@ yan@@ in and Mayor of Tel Aviv Ron Hul@@ dai agreed to collaborate in tourism and security .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to be in the back of Russia .
it was even bigger since it was committed by a supposed friend .
&quot; it is difficult , if not even impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media conducted a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; at the serious test , the accus@@ ations of leading officials , that Erd@@ ogan would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has disp@@ uted this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin had received the excuse that he wanted to hear from the President Erd@@ ogan . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire is clear on the hand . &quot;
Erd@@ ogan is primarily a member of all the friends he can get after the last month in a failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat .
&quot; on the other hand , terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him . &quot;
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - particularly the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number is almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights will be taken back . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week forecast the state television cheaper fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demographic sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West because it &apos;s reaction to the attempted power transfer as a weak answer .
&quot; to this end , the ongoing gro@@ ll of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ racy is to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian state of State won a bonus that he called for the attempted coup of government support for the elected state organs . &quot;
this is a matter of course for Moscow a matter of course that even has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
&quot; the summit meeting in this bright palace on the sea led to Russia and Turkey , one of how to portra@@ y an analy@@ st once described as an analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of foreign ages &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate themselves from the West and then burned down badly . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently made the role as peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
it could be noted that after almost three hours of initial discussions both pre@@ sidents spoke at the press conference that they had not stopped the issue .
&quot; the president of Turkey missed it on a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus about where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ appearance , when NATO member Turkey crashed the Russian fighter - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State will at least talk to each other . &quot;

it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cally over three years if we had said we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .

Poroshenko to speak at UN General Assembly meeting dedicated to large movements of refugees
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismis@@ sed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years of the nar@@ row@@ est vote of confidence by Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , Putin has ordered the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ a@@ ino , who was Vice President since 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ a@@ ino , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in 1972 , in the Estonian capital of Tallinn , he made his degree at the prestigious State of Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the emb@@ assy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is ( in Russian ) that he later became a leader and head of the government staff later . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin , &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state in regards to draft bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and V@@ a@@ ino recommended as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confi@@ ding Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin who was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff appeared on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , just a few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
&quot; so , here is the result of a kind of power struggle ? &quot;
there are no translations available .
&quot; but the official claim - that a man who was once preferred as potential President , would like to lead to the Russian environmental policy - met with great skep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you in the beginning of 2012 in a conversation with me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compla@@ ining for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now linked with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project should be completed until May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cros@@ sings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fever .
&quot; it is the first of four lock@@ ings of the &quot; &quot; ceiling fan &quot; , &quot; which is the completion for each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge @-@ cut of Fi@@ fe is 600 metres long and weigh@@ s 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 inclined ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown provided a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first , which went from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cros@@ sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , nearly 79 % of the total bridge de@@ cks at their place and the last section of the deck gets a bed for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the closure is the future @-@ proof high and low construction . &quot;
&quot; after installation of the last street section and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the existing gap on the North or land side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the nor@@ ament bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , since the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 meters long , weigh@@ s about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled upwards of approx . 3 % upwards . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances to which the team works , they were tiny - on each side they ru@@ ined only a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;

&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim , while their boat went out of their own power . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us the worst before , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of their reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found on a Bo@@ je hanging without rescue v@@ est . &quot;
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boots and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water , fortunately un@@ hurt and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this did not dis@@ solve the boat during bo@@ ots from the person who was stun@@ ned by boat . &quot;

who is building Braunschweig &apos;s convenient apartments ?
&quot; in the future , the SPD and the Green have said : &quot; &quot; investors should be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 favorable homes in the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; Action Plan &quot; &quot; for the next council meeting . &quot;
but contro@@ versy is programmed .
&quot; first of all , it is about the question : who should actually build the inexpensive apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing .
&quot; the SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; who wants to build on urban areas , will need 20 per cent of all dwell@@ ings as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the favorable apartments can also be built in the stock . &quot;
&quot; the major issue in the town hall was , however , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you go with investors that want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of the apartments build as social apartments . &quot;
&quot; a new urban building subsi@@ dy programme , which will cost millions of costs and will still be financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CDU would like to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left will still want tough@@ er editions for investors .
&quot; in spite of its , so Brat@@ mann , a mer@@ cil@@ ess of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the building management . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but still , the program is not entirely different : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built already anyway . &quot;
but how do you compare the loss of more about 1300 favorable apartments which will run in the next few years ?
&quot; by 2020 , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the plan@@ etary spre@@ ader , Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; on one blow , the problem could be solved . &quot;
because in the western city the end of the year is the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be found there in the price range for cheap apartments .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; the number of social apartments in the western city will dras@@ tically increase , from the goal of so @-@ called penetration . &quot;
a concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city should no longer be given .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there is still movement in the discussion .
&quot; President Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CDU has to go into the boat . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it &apos;s fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
&quot; in the last decade , teenagers and children don &apos;t want to play outdoors , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , the last decade has been compla@@ ined of many . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ emon go , it &apos;s about to get people from the sofa and get more active . &quot;
&quot; the time at the screen was initially on television , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other . &quot;
&quot; I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were created for video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture dropped interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are followed by a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; &quot; ( about a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was still younger , lock down the track and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in incre@@ ments that the &quot; average &quot; person reco@@ vers every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed the 35@@ .000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of persec@@ uted people who train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to bring about 30 minutes of time , &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring and come from people coming out . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who drives regularly sports , reduces its chances of getting cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that people can do something outdoors so that they have fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people join the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there are also m@@ ashed tok@@ ens that have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has a breakthrough for itself .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit have already been able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game . &quot;
&quot; the new will lose its appeal , and the use will be followed by time . &quot;
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success there will be more games , the apps and virtual reality will be united in the real world and will help many people on hunt , active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the floor .
on the whole line of brilliant .
&quot; and now , the Olympic champion . &quot;
&quot; the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ asi@@ um was born on Thursday for the title track , and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; her total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly visible in front of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team amer@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish bar during the individual multi @-@ competition of women in the Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; it is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American who wins a multi @-@ battle title and a total of the fifth , while she calls their call to be the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey took place at this moment .
this success is in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world champ@@ ions - including 10 Gold Med@@ als - including 10 Gold Med@@ als - with so amazing exercises , that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they expected it a last examination in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered as dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ competition of women in the summer of 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;

&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on , during their long way to the top , never the future planned , it is not really true . &quot;
a part of their soil exercises - which included their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans , was discovered during a school@@ trip to the gymn@@ asi@@ um in Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has no longer lost a competition competition , a victory set that will last for as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easily led by two turns , the picture was dec@@ eived . &quot;
Swedish Bar and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ ded .
&quot; she returned to the Swedish Bar again with 15,@@ 433 on the Swedish Bar - and sat on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g@@ ged her gently as she expected her end - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears of bright red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book . &quot;
&quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ man was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal entered in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke on Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man @-@ owned company called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; was named &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after their floor exercises , they cast the crowd to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes appeared desperate . &quot;

&quot; police : 3 victims in series mur@@ ders in the car , shot in the car &quot;
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl shot dead in one of the deadly attacks since a decade in the first series of mur@@ der@@ ous attacks since a decade in the first series of mur@@ ders , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a journey , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ators fired eight shots from a fire weapon while he stood on the passenger side of the car , and then flew with another vehicle to read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police told that the triple murder would not seem to be the result of a pre@@ dator , because the attack@@ ers did not have the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who took possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police officer of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting is the investig@@ ator to make a closer look at it , whether it is connected to four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , seven people were killed and two others were injured in h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic residential areas within four months . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , in the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects have used several vehicles , including a brown @-@ in @-@ one from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that they were linked to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah sc@@ ars still on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on shooting , which went on an empty pickup truck for half an hour before the triple murder , and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball out of the seat as well as spher@@ ical fragments from the engine compartment .

some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize it .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with help of a help .
Ed@@ mund was neither able to sit nor cr@@ um@@ ble until his third year of age .

it can run with assistance and bike .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .

&quot; we bring a drawing language , &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical character language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
&quot; micro@@ c@@ eption has a variety of causes : genetic , as with Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as mas@@ ons or Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;

heavy rain@@ falls and large @-@ area floo@@ ds in Lou@@ isi@@ ana were forced to call the Gover@@ nor on Friday . it is expected to take over the whole Saturday over with more rain@@ falls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their shore and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ds in extreme rain , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards told that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and have already been on the way for help to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , told that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags were repeated . &quot;
he said that Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested tens of thousands of sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ d@@ light system is used over wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service caused an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood @-@ breakfast system was used on Friday , while it continues to rain in the area of Mobile . &quot;
&quot; the River Com@@ es near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will reach record levels of all probability . &quot;

he said he would have warned him another step@@ son who lives near .
&quot; we are aw@@ ak@@ ened and floo@@ ded in the water , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford that she lived in the 48 years in which she lived there , never seen such a high level of the river . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all han@@ di@@ caps , and he was the only one who could swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that &quot; &quot; floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; had been spread quickly , as there were still serious rain@@ falls and that the authorities consider ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches rain . &quot;

the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which were now floo@@ ded .
&quot; the chief of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , washed away from the flood . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , not@@ ations were set up in order to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will return to their homes again , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; he has done much , his small body was blown out of balls , divided his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the state of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .

he would have to start the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable state .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who found himself in a critical condition , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police determine if one of the injured men of the perpet@@ r@@ ator could be found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; patches for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ se@@ ded the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a lasting struggle .

why we need Simone and Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ am@@ ity in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US had never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three turbines , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish is and Madi@@ son Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ licon , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has strengthened the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among the female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
&quot; last year , Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 . &quot;
this shows strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising winner of the Olympic med@@ alli@@ ons and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as they delivered unexpected yet master@@ ly G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American who won gold in an individual event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see gy@@ ms throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Madi@@ son to create it to the Olympic team . &quot;
it is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a coach .
&quot; but the reality looks so that Tur@@ ns are an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts are primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics that are maintained by parents , which will be maintained by parents for training , setup , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics are in wealthy subur@@ bs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both her athletes since they started with the tur@@ nes . &quot;
&quot; we have to make the churches au@@ n inn@@ umer@@ able , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , enable a more efficient and easy @-@ to @-@ access training . &quot;
I was founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um for 20 years .
&quot; in my events , we have free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 ur@@ bane young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ i ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics , which make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and certainty for the spirit . &quot;
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is an exciting time .
&quot; thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madi@@ son for this true presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ en of Olympic club@@ team gol@@ ds and thank you so many young girls with a different background to start their way to start healthy , strong , and successful young women . &quot;
assistant physicians want to organize further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 assist@@ ants who voted for election . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt plans unveiled plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS were in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
the first assistance doctors should receive a new contract that contains changes to night and weekend work to improve the care of the watch times .
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the B@@ MA comp@@ ress for assistance physicians last night in a message with : &quot; &quot; Assi@@ sts informed us about the proposed agreement as before serious concerns , in particular that it will cure the current workforce crisis and to treat it to all physicians . &quot;
&quot; at only eight weeks that remain until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts from the B@@ MA to resolve disputes due to conversations with the government on ad@@ vers@@ aries and sometimes sil@@ ently sil@@ ently silence .
&quot; that happened to a promise that Jerem@@ y Hunt had made it last month , that his door would always be off@@ ended . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Hunt now has to act now to raise the vibration and address the concerns of the assistance doctors .
&quot; if he does not do this , the assistance doctors have made clear that they are ready to carry out further working conditions . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 sched@@ ules , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in order to grant physicians on the quar@@ terly basis . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes by an acceptance of the reform treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
heart attack and stroke cases are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the walls of the ar@@ tery walls that form coverings .
&quot; if the layer breaks apart , it can cause blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when blood cl@@ ots dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through blood flow and causes blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;

culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness can flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year due to the dism@@ iss@@ al of a government report due to corruption from the office
&quot; a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is ignor@@ ant , like a non @-@ destructive government report today . &quot;
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les attacks the police , ob@@ serving observ@@ ters and sh@@ ouses to be ignored by &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to ethnic and religion &quot; &quot; due to &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to ethnic and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and municipal government , who now has a face @-@ corruption problem , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters in religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut@@ ters outside of electoral cables to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot;
it is advis@@ able that voters should lead a reference to their identity in order to prove their identity .
&quot; at the moment , a voters must simply call his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not removable ink on the fingers of a person when they vote their vote , to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
&quot; W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non official comp@@ ress or work@@ groups .
&quot; this is not only for election fraud , but also the municipal government in front of the wider corruption and financial crisis that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special voting court decided that the resulting Mayor Lut@@ for Rah@@ man should be revealed to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way and that he could silence his critics with r@@ att@@ les@@ - and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis that it is the reli@@ ant duty of Muslims to elect him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a imitation , when one person sel@@ ects someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there were evidence for fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed particular emphasis on the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - when the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the leaders of instruc@@ tors to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report , it is said : &quot; &quot; it was proof that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was ex@@ er@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose from the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pakist@@ ani or b@@ ang@@ lad@@ an background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions such as such behaviour are ignor@@ ant of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity concerning ethnic and religion ignor@@ antly .
&quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations in order to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists are working letter documents to stop &quot; &quot; election harvest &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the report written by Ther@@ esa May also demands tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral register for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider choices to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable inks on the finger of a person as soon as they have released their voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic verification of the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic letter of letter .
prohibition that political activists are working full letter of letters and envel@@ opes of letter choices .
the police have to give the authority to set off the lock @-@ up stations .
&quot; a law amend@@ ment , which facilit@@ ated an accus@@ ation for inti@@ mid@@ ation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( Volks@@ oper Act 1983 ) . &quot;
there are no translations available .
requirement that only English can be used in the choice stations ( except Wales ) .
&quot; in order to ensure that the staff will rule the rule that voters will go alone to the election cabin . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint . &quot;

&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was guilty of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements of criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; he also critic@@ ises the &quot; &quot; ab@@ ha@@ k@@ contro@@ len &quot; &quot; of the election registr@@ ations of the Town Hall . &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court sur@@ passed in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country we@@ ars a proud heritage as the mother of the parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and conce@@ aled spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities threat@@ ens this good reputation . &quot;
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic in this summer is not the only one to get gold @-@ fighting ath@@ l@@ ete who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , if one can give faith to the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ ps at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olymp@@ ion that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team at Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since childhood . &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the bike track , many people on the internet showed how a certain arch@@ ery of the Zw@@ illing of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures , where he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the arch@@ ery received the ma@@ dness in the social media and gave him that he has already heard that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I even see no great simil@@ arity , except the facial hair , shared bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I hate it as compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the apparent simil@@ arity between British Weit@@ br@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes should go through as a double @-@ conductor for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; another lasting comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , which resem@@ bles heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal held in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and blonde hair , like actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne McC@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian von fans was att@@ ested to the &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;

buyer in Pri@@ mark indig@@ nant about woman who ta@@ sted in the middle of business sham@@ eless under@@ wear
the buyer did not know where to see when a woman moved her clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants .
&quot; in order to make the situation worse , they mut@@ ed how they saw it , drag@@ ged them out and put them back to the shelf . &quot;
they continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping m@@ all in Folk@@ estone .

&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , she went back and the business left without buying something . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; the people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the placement , pulled her own st@@ ump pants and trousers and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t even tried to find a somewhat discre@@ et place to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ ch like Osk@@ ar . &quot;
everyone star@@ ed when she with@@ drew the lower pants that she obviously didn &apos;t like because she put them back into the shelf .
&quot; she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t fell asleep , and went out . &quot;
it seemed not to distur@@ b that she was watching someone - or about the person who would buy the lower pants that she had tried .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in Kent , said : &quot; &quot; how can I think that someone would take under@@ pants with home , who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; as I have received , the staff tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - what is just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate it , with a new pair of under@@ pants to go home and find out that another woman had had her and did not wash them . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ one M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Federation in New York , to find out how to walk around with armed rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how you turn around the sp@@ ear for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; when you get back from behind , you should turn around as a first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the line , &quot; says M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him with his knees and turn away while the att@@ acker fights against pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they align the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; when att@@ acker , approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the line , take the weapon and turn it so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , store the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it is M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it is the saf@@ est way to pass your money - if you don &apos;t have Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide to the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe

they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
&quot; the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon , and with the documentary film , we were able to provide consumers more information on an interesting way . &quot;
I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film directed by the film , added : &quot; let me say - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he would have liked to check out some of the things I have instruc@@ ted to him , as the ec@@ lec@@ tic Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to bring them down , and others , where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .

&quot; an aso@@ cial family left her social apartment after a del@@ og@@ ging with a loss of £ 50,000 , because she had terr@@ ori@@ ed her neighb@@ ors . &quot;
T@@ anya Sk@@ el@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were accused after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash and Corn@@ wall .
&quot; after they were forced to be removed from their property , they found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls were lam@@ ented holes , wooden floors were rough@@ ened , g@@ arb@@ age was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family were res@@ ett@@ ed and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall Housing , said they feared that the apartment would no longer be repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was a absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I &apos;m the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider because this property is presum@@ ably regarded as not as beautiful part of the walls .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had added the family , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dating from residents , drug traffi@@ cking , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and flu@@ kes included . &quot;
&quot; Sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house that is torn down under circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wood di@@ mp@@ s were excited . &quot;
&quot; neighbours said they had to fight them on the road , and regularly called the police . &quot;
Corn@@ wall Housing made her and her partner to force this week violent by the property after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
&quot; the del@@ og@@ ation was che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neighbours , saying that their lives were made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
the countless times that we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
&quot; we stood up , because it was so quiet here - that we are not acc@@ ustom@@ ed to ! &quot;
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said it would have been to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police were called regularly at regular intervals , for 20 years . &quot;
g@@ arb@@ age and old toys were thrown on the roof@@ ed side of the town hall
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a shame that the ten@@ ant is given to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , since a del@@ og@@ ging is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extremely and their deeds were terrible for their neighb@@ ors .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community , have been cour@@ age@@ ous to us and have made us the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will provide some neighb@@ ors and con@@ veys the message that anti@@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

Sk@@ el@@ don was granted a fine sentence after being guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in trade vision .
&quot; she claimed that the money for a tomb of her son Lee Sk@@ el@@ don was , who came to life in 2013 in an accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , it assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti .
the police say they will del@@ og@@ ate ten@@ ants who are unable to comply with the house rules
&quot; by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , Angela C@@ row told that the del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not comply with the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they can act without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those who have been damaged by such behavior , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

with this surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
Amphi 2015 Warm @-@ up - Call The Ship To Port 2015
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring musical into the tem@@ ples of classical music and filled with the role of Maria a youth room .
&quot; in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that Bern@@ steins is really in our blood !
&quot; in this stage , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
&quot; she remembered her love with Tony , while the younger Mary is playing and dancing . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascin@@ ated me .
first because they are musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then it would be the personality of Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; they say it in their song : &quot; &quot; I feel sorry , oh so stupid , I feel confident and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; it is wise , of course na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character I have seen as a Roman , &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with you .
it is an enorm@@ ously generous person .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli is the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ duc@@ ting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his bli@@ ss , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheer@@ ful approach to life , that &apos;s very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;

&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood . &quot;

&quot; as far as it goes , it doesn &apos;t work : summer holidays , heat and landing competition - that is fair . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced of the election , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the holi@@ day@@ makers who are in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are no locals , must not choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers who attach posters , distribute air bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers and count on the end of the vote only to apply lab@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and the last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass a election campaign almost all over the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , when you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 , is now in surveys clearly behind the CDU . &quot;
&quot; it is exciting , how strong newcom@@ ers are cut off and what is left at the end of the coalition . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from its large pla@@ sters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , as well as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;

&quot; their refugee policy , &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; has accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CDU with its nick@@ name candidates , the Minister of Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already seen how it is , if one is at the wrong time at the right place of election campaign . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; otherwise , the North @-@ East CDU reno@@ unces the usual electoral conditions on market places and before shopping m@@ alls with umb@@ rel@@ las and bal@@ lo@@ ons . &quot;

&quot; the Union has also noted that in the country , it is the base that it needs to be very strict again to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; they are like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the sides of the country hardly exist . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CDU candidate co@@ ert to his fellow workers is also self @-@ reli@@ ant : &quot; &quot; you must go there where people are : Dor@@ f@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a very committed election campaign . &quot;

there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehab@@ ilit@@ ated .
&quot; for those responsible for building work , starting at 5.@@ 30 am and only at 8@@ pm , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything quite nice , &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff tells of the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super @-@ team .
there is also no retreat .
&quot; the construction site could be moved to south at the beginning of the half @-@ time , until the end of October . &quot;
&quot; this will also be praised for those who are responsible for the construction work , for example if it comes to the establishment of Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ein@@ jour@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the south , and the block of the asphalt road in Of@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted and that the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has been re @-@ established , the traffic situation is relaxed within the village . &quot;
the citizens can now go on both sides from Of@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 .

&quot; despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the largest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its many years of history . &quot;
&quot; 6 months construction work , that is brutal . &quot;
it is constantly being screw@@ ed in the name of terrorist attacks against laws .
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère places a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a terror status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Vers@@ öh@@ ner .
&quot; all his proposals be politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; the Federal Minister of Interior also says to the idea of his new security package . &quot;
they don &apos;t demand anybody .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , as Interior Minister , he was located at the results and at a &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère sent a little time before he presented his conclusions for safety in the Republic . &quot;

the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; for the first time , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second run for proposals that have not yet to be done with the SPD : he wants to make sympathy for terrorist groups under pun@@ ish@@ ments and ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;

&quot; and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of Ged@@ ul@@ ers , for example , the question : what really does it have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère says it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the offen@@ ders of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people were wor@@ rying about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that were deeply involved in the people , were not to cl@@ en@@ force themselves in electoral periods . &quot;
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is large .
&quot; and yes , there are elections . &quot;
&quot; on the issue of inner safety , the Union and the SPD are increasingly involved in their position . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , between the two parties went high . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Police , the Minister of Internal Affairs , then on a safety @-@ policy ideas collection of several women &apos;s ministers , in which the R@@ ess@@ or@@ ites also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a rep@@ ent@@ ance from the dual citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also working here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
&quot; from a rep@@ ent@@ ance from the double pass , he is nothing . &quot;

&quot; whether his own parcel is un@@ constitutional and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partners , it is still necessary to show itself . &quot;
there is a lot of things that could cause contro@@ versy .
but the SPD is trying to gain inner safety on the subject of inner safety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot;

&quot; with the wide term &quot; Warran@@ ty , &quot; Volkswagen offers the possibility that customers can come back in a workshop for half a year after conversion , and this will result in the new software even if the damage has nothing to do . &quot;

&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while in the midst of a busy street in S@@ oho , a humble grey suit , and a little bit of writing like : &quot; so , let &apos;s throw a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of S@@ oh@@ os slowly emerg@@ es slowly on its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill up the building in which once independent vendors were resident - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record stores . &quot;
I would probably ask the camera to turn the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mind through observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I am of Si@@ ster Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle age ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is a day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , ask me ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3.000 or 4,000 sheets . &quot;
&quot; these sound boards , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by E @-@ Mail , I &apos;m not followed by the house ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when they appeared and once again buy items he sold when he was young and helpful . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60@@ ies , early 70@@ ies , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things , where I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it is true that those who buy plates are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend their time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot;
this is my La@@ ster .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard of the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and promp@@ ted themselves to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; by the conversations I have led , people usually have dischar@@ ged their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their CDs , so he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to supporters of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ on@@ ica to see that record stores offers a so@@ othing community of equality .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took an imp@@ etus to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to return to the stability of familiar noise platforms , from objects , the happ@@ ier it@@ ching inner@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material pos@@ er than a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
that &apos;s me as a collector so I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to think spirit@@ ually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April reveal that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record last month , they haven &apos;t heard them yet . &quot;
&quot; the survey found that 41 % have a record player , which they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , do not own record players . &quot;
&quot; at that time of the news report , I would probably look very worried while I bl@@ ur through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Kom@@ pil@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men mean age ) has noticed a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound board so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more product information , less music @-@ like . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player .
&quot; they are younger people , not older ones who only come from slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ opp , dedicated to the sound@@ boards almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women middle ages . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the afor@@ emen@@ tioned stores , Wild Be@@ asts newer synthes@@ izer and sex@@ ually packs pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ills from the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; no one of them looks strange , but nag@@ ging mental trau@@ mat@@ a are difficult to determine if one stands beside someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around a few minutes in business and looks at the variety of plates for sale . &quot;
you tend to be a female mannequ@@ in than a large purchase .
&quot; they do not deserve much , therefore the collecting of plates is no real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or another way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I give the appearance to mu@@ ck the jeans area , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a stair@@ case , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; panel art . &quot;
&quot; however , considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and to send some customers to the depths of S@@ oh@@ os for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most for luxury objects such as plates . &quot;

France doesn &apos;t recognize legitimacy of the Russian elections in Crimea
&quot; a French court rejected a quot@@ ation of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; in case of a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state was supposed to sell 72 provis@@ ional transactions in which people sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to Energ@@ y@@ drinks , selling , hair@@ dressing services or to sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provis@@ ional restaurants . &quot;
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that of a fire and san@@ ity risk .
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups will not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also led out that the provis@@ ional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the allocation of people who run the 72 provis@@ ional transactions , but ro@@ uted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that the gro@@ cery stores , caf@@ és and restaurants would play a much bigger role than to feed people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers are offered .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the lower tear was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is non profit @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum seek@@ ers for the hundreds of vulnerable min@@ ers , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ ,000 people signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closure &quot; for these children would be a disaster , of which the youngest eight years old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des M@@ igrants estimated on Friday that the number of living in the jungle camp was increased to more than 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of new arri@@ vals in the course of summer . &quot;

&quot; in Germany R@@ aser has to adjust to the next generation speed measurement : in various federal states , among other things in Hesse and Brandenburg , new flash@@ ers will be tested , the tem@@ pos@@ als are particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; for example , the fut@@ uris@@ tic En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accident prevention , where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway building sites or to be rehab@@ ilit@@ ated bridges with temporary tem@@ ples , there is often no need for infrastructure to ensure speed limit . &quot;
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complicated .
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is autonomous : his battery holds five days at un@@ interrupted measuring mode , the case data are encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as access @-@ forbidden to time , chassis and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art situation , it is possible to move the trailer according to manufacturer by car with trailer coupling . &quot;

&quot; the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came to a ab@@ rupt halt in the last hur@@ dle in the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were hit by a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji distributed a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back , line and ro@@ her strength to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ame@@ da@@ ille of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was swe@@ pt through the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth in this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of it , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form . &quot;

&quot; V@@ breath@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ ached by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams , and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate . &quot;
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still se@@ eded . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led fundamental changes to half @-@ time , and closed the fi@@ ji@@ hadi@@ st gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favour of the south @-@ cons@@ ulate , whose fans sang , f@@ ading and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame set the i @-@ door with another attempt in the last few seconds .
&quot; the P@@ FI@@ FF rang , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and the GB ki@@ cked off in the grass . &quot;
&quot; in the past , Fi@@ ji Japan conquered Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 , and Britain pressed South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the profit - and therefore the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the cancer of the trainer to the rowing victory
&quot; by Andrzej On February 8 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that enter into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ aci@@ o da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was in a row , the first women in the history of the British Sports , which put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their cla@@ ws un@@ folded , which is also exemplary . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , which gli@@ des over the surface with the elegance of plans , which is not reflected in the type of trium@@ ph@@ al . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in rowing , a batt@@ ali@@ on is an willing hel@@ pers who contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and it was no more comfortable than the coach who would survive this day if he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had a bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do this , it spreads out everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , what the inter@@ ruption was to a minimum if that was the right concept under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
so it begins .
&quot; the rowing of itself is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the im@@ pair@@ ability of the victory , their first thoughts on Williams , who had a nerve @-@ writ@@ able morning , spent more than usual and tried to handle his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , which was the captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . it might be something extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it repe@@ ats only how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin would we be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I would have no better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to get rid of it .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to make something T@@ oll@@ es .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adventures Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , exemplary for clarity &quot;

&quot; the drinking water @-@ suitable association of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe with seat in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , community Breit@@ brunn , promotes about 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water and provides 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member communities are the churches of Kirch@@ dorf , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; for further cities and municipalities , there are water suppliers . &quot;
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Rupert G@@ öller was appointed as a water @-@ bar and was appointed to the Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; his tasks are very diverse and they stretched out of water management and maintenance work on office and organisational skills , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , it called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the new creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial re@@ aliz@@ ations of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no stand@@ still , and I have always recorded innovations since water lives and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their lau@@ d@@ atio , they praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has been used with a lot of heart bleeding for his water @-@ purpose , and he has lived the water @-@ purpose verband , as if it would be his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was a real practition@@ er to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; for this , he received very much recognition and praise . &quot;
&quot; Rupert G@@ öller himself praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water @-@ man and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as the highlights from his point of view , he described the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult use , however , were the pipe break in the high container at Kirch@@ lou@@ a on a third of January . &quot;
&quot; at minus 17 degrees , the whole night had to work through , so that the villages had to be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained by filling the high container from P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;

&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG transformation of 20 percent will be replaced . &quot;
but also these will not be collected in the steel industry .

&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation will largely be fixed . &quot;

the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
&quot; in the past year , the situation continues , as the world &apos;s largest producer of gro@@ oming in China , faced with the weak@@ ening domestic demand for mass steel on the world market . &quot;
European producers throw Chinese steel companies price d@@ umping .

&quot; at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 0,000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel manufacturers remain c@@ auti@@ ous despite increasing prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; they produced a total of 3.4 million tonnes of good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the economic association was split on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the quantity now returned the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is by two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;

&quot; L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening of songs with older people ar@@ ous@@ ed many memories , often associated with positive feelings of her youth . &quot;
&quot; by Li@@ ed@@ ell and especially melodies , even de@@ men@@ z@@ dise@@ ased men were rec@@ alled at long back events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also demands a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time concentr@@ ating on their own voice and to a pre@@ determined rhythm , and to adapt to the other singers - this is a big cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; especially older people , who live alone , do not only concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , writes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; even if I have a long time for something , I will be better and alert beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to begin with singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try out a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he thinks that little talent advis@@ es L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who h@@ ears when a sound comes next to it ? &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; if someone comes from the well @-@ known circle in a senior ench@@ ant@@ ment , you can easily connect . &quot;
many towns also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
he who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church .
many senior cho@@ irs can be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you have no access to the internet , the family , friends or neighb@@ ors can ask for help in the internet search . &quot;
&quot; who wants to sing , should definitely join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul good and has something a liberation - this is true for any age .
cats react sensi@@ bly as a boy on scre@@ ams of the young animals
&quot; bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover , which effect the rowing of K@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals . &quot;
&quot; to her surprise , the male didn &apos;t leave the male cold - however , they beha@@ ved in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of K@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on the ke@@ e@@ pers of the little ones .
&quot; they respond by ten percent faster on Lau@@ te of K@@ itt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great need such as scientists from the veter@@ inary university and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
K@@ ater is also responding to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always at the same time .
&quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the mi@@ a@@ wing of less and heavily loaded young animals for the males either are not percep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
it is the first author@@ isation of the study published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ e is distinguished with the ur@@ gency of their help . &quot;
&quot; in total , nine adult male cat and eight female dogs were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; they were played for a call of little ones , taken out for three minutes from the lit@@ ter box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens who were raised in addition . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; all females , even those who did not have their own offspring , responded to the scre@@ e , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they rot@@ ten faster to the loud@@ speakers when this calls of the very expensive k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop@@ ped with sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the male respon@@ ds at all , &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; however , some studies showed that women re@@ acted sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;

&quot; as a fortress that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ub@@ el@@ tower . &quot;
but there are many other athletes who are going to start the Olympic Games despite dop@@ ing past in Rio .
here is an overview :
&quot; Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was closed for two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since his B@@ ann , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ champion is even faster than before , he is more than 100 m in the world and is considered the greatest challenge of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;

a bomb explosion in the morning was also reported by Ph@@ uk@@ et .
&quot; after police data , a taxi driver was injured . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb exploded . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air according to the authorities in a flo@@ wer@@ pot before the Re@@ vier of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; finally , even det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast several injured . &quot;
&quot; in a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called it . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks have the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; said Ar@@ kan@@ eral Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Free Day in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express itself to possible motives - probably , however , it is about the acts of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; in the attacks , Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Thai police , on the other hand , stated that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist insur@@ rection or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited territories and provinces , &quot; &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the bom@@ b@@ ings of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret evidence on pending attacks in the South of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
&quot; it is still un@@ clear , which group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police showed their officials throughout the country , providing security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amus@@ ement districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not judge for tourists . &quot;
&quot; in Hu@@ a H@@ in , a palace that was used over years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j was used . &quot;
&quot; after the nun@@ n@@ ery bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;

&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) charges for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were unsuccessful a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution issued by the military jun@@ ta .
this cle@@ ars the military great influence in the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta CEO and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that bombs were an attempt to sti@@ fle chaos , while the country towards stability , improved economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , holds itself good to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting the revol@@ t of Muslim rebels for years in the out@@ ward south of the country . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people were killed . &quot;
&quot; almost one year ago , Bangkok was killed by a attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ shr@@ ine 20 people - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloody attack of the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; is in the sight of the Federal Office for Constitutional protection . &quot;
&quot; ( F ) stands for Facts , ( S ) for Students &apos; opinion , ( P ) for Professor &apos;s opinion and ( A ) for the opinion of the al@@ umni . &quot;

&quot; in this way , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in an extrem@@ ist manner . &quot;
this is why we observe the movement now .
&quot; the &quot; identical movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; identical movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where they stand , &quot; &quot; said the chief executive . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with you@@ thful voice , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
&quot; the Islam@@ ists , as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot;
this is not a concrete advertisement for the own thing .
the propaganda is intended to attract people emotion@@ ally .
young people are in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , there were reports about contacts of &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he had no knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes its target direction and is so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
this is the decisive factor if such persons have influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase of legitimate crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee accommodations , Ma@@ a@@ ßen , he would not talk about new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , we have found that there can be justi@@ fiable structures . &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ t@@ aler group .
&quot; it can be quite clear that other juris@@ dic@@ tional group@@ ings or small groups are formed , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against asylum seek@@ ers , or attacks from other extrem@@ ist extrem@@ ist motifs . &quot;
&quot; a nationwide or European @-@ wide control of juris@@ dic@@ tions , however , is not recogni@@ zable . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; on the other hand , Ma@@ a@@ ßen had concerned that many attacks on the account of men did not have occurred in the right scene in the right scene . &quot;
this is the concern of concern .
&quot; many of the suspect suspected of attacks on asylum seek@@ ers should not be known as criminals , politically motivated crimes or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes committed in front of extreme right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which might have been politically in@@ different , or for example CDU , SPD or Left , which have been radic@@ alised by far @-@ right extre@@ mis@@ tic m@@ oods . &quot;

&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus company of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to its specifications , had to avoid an opposite shore , which is partly on the opposite road . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ pped into a tren@@ ch , like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund . &quot;
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;

&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , there are also overl@@ aps or under@@ covers from the previous calculation period . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt believes that there are relatively small facilities with a very low wast@@ ewater treatment , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the low distribution basis for example expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water volume is slightly decl@@ ining in all three plants . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the rec@@ ir@@ culation period for all three systems , the period of renovation and repair costs will remain in a considerable extent due to their age of renovation and repair costs . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the plants for pupp@@ ies , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt proved that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage .
&quot; in the p@@ umping station of Wel@@ ch , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and the first clari@@ fication had to be removed after nearly 20 years of operation of the first sewage slu@@ dge , the sewage slu@@ dge and an additional ventilation facility to be installed in the future . &quot;

ISIS : here to Stay ! - Part 1
&quot; the United States Central Command &apos;s military related information is to draw up an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as the actual conditions were allowed in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Republi@@ can members of the armed forces , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command &apos;s intelligence analy@@ st , reported how to re@@ ass@@ ert their ass@@ essments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;

the ten @-@ page report shows detailed and ongoing problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there are no direct indications that government tops have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed to the pressure from their predec@@ essors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press releases , opinions and statements before the Congress were significantly more positive than the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com affiliated minister publicly announced that a military withdrawal of Mos@@ cons@@ in could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ con@@ sul , second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , it is so much clear . &quot; &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the following service reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after them that analysts were concerned about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
&quot; the report will be completed by more detailed insights , while the investigations continue to be continued . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are carried out by the General Inspector of the Defence Ministry . &quot;
democratic members of the intelligence ministry published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ com created a very limited process for the creation of educational ass@@ essments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services . &quot;
&quot; this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of detailed reports , &quot; said the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; gave a little room for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; however , Mr. Schiff and the Democrats advised not to have any notes on an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ com analysts in regard to a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by the Pentagon &apos;s chief investig@@ ator , who were deta@@ ined by Cent@@ com Analy@@ sten &apos;s complaints . &quot;
&quot; in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the congress , while the investigation of the general insp@@ ector was still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also provided that &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite di@@ verg@@ ent opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense have gre@@ eted a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have the impact on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that has now been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of the past year have rejected the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest ass@@ essments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the offensive information about the Islamic State , from more than ten years ago , was a cent@@ com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a font on how the former government looked at the recommendations of many analysts only a small crew of occupation in Iraq and took a little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in insur@@ rection against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to speci@@ alize in government agencies that no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group would have had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group as these provis@@ ional refin@@ eries were in operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this realization was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;

&quot; a day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of the women in a match on Thursday against India , that the Americans with 3 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember this ever done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I am not belonging to the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 at Olympic competition and are at the same time in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two teams from six teams will win the first and second place . &quot;
the first place will go to the strong Dutch little longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
&quot; as well as the game on Saturday , Americans have triggered a surprising vort@@ ex through their success story , four years after they landed at last London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she was the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
they missed the Olympics in 2008 because they couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , where she and her team went everything . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an English , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a culture change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work place in London that we have now .
we have to tear down the ru@@ dder completely .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a back@@ hand out of the seam . &quot;
&quot; India was in the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; they performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flank , then moved to the middle and invited the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 leadership . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs who had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the ra@@ fting of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , the Olympic Games are . &quot;
&quot; in Rio de Janeiro , events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly growing and un@@ avo@@ idable , a rapid relay between competition and stri@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which is enough from the w@@ rist@@ guard to the gymn@@ as@@ tics for tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t switch to TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighb@@ ors during the waiting time in the coffee shop , without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ opol@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female &apos;s black with dim@@ ples , would have been quite well known among these known names that would be sent to Prime Time , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even F@@ encing . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights at the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines for gold . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade there are sports that are not commonly recognized : air pist@@ ols , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the bre@@ asts and may reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I should make more modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ oline jumping has already been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years saw that many people who had sur@@ vey@@ ed did not know that it is at all a Olympics port . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA has sent athletes to competition , there has never won a medal in the tramp@@ oline jumping until 2012 , which has made it up to the end of 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans who share the women for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend her gold medal from London .

&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a gro@@ unded enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ or@@ istic potential - the carto@@ oni@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never ending up@@ lifting - but also the gra@@ zie of the gymn@@ asi@@ um and dive , which combines two kinds of sports that are essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means so much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; jumping on a gig@@ antic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , hal@@ f@@ way and sal@@ ads ) before they land at the feet . &quot;

the most common olymp@@ ic vector is straight ahead .
&quot; in their quest for gold , med@@ alli@@ sts have to go faster , faster , upward and over , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes and back , upwards and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they ch@@ ase not only the line @-@ line or the output wall , but also in the TV transmission also another cave goal : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented stri@@ ving is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atical - and it &apos;s enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;

a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ one , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games only .

violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; protesters who demand political changes in Ethiopia , ate on violent resistance in the government . &quot;
witnesses say that sevent@@ y prot@@ agoni@@ sts were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police during firing .
is Ethiopia just to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government were sh@@ aken by the government , and far more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people collap@@ sed on the streets and long @-@ held fundamental political changes .
the answer to the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful according to human rights organizations .
&quot; as a result , police officers were killed and killed in a number of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security officers beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;

&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ated country of Africa and its stability is estimated from the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopia to fight terrorism over the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued the suppression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dis@@ sidents have been effective . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or prison , put into prison or put into the desert of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you press people and do not have any other options except prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lect@@ urer in Central Ethiop@@ ien . &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation is prot@@ ru@@ ding .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the floor use to the wor@@ sen@@ ing of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions are rising along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a fight for these z@@ ack@@ y , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , who were more or less forced to use the turbul@@ ence , could be armed and armed . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of inc@@ ision are now explo@@ ding under the surface .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , mostly at protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they keep up . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians demanded that they gathered themselves as protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
&quot; since ae@@ ons , the am@@ har@@ as that come from Ethiopia are predominantly Christian high @-@ countries , in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas . &quot;
but that is changing .
&quot; we are in co @-@ ordin@@ ating under a screen , &quot; Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u said , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which is dominated by around 6 per cent of the population and that are dominant in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up to his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was considered a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
&quot; analysts say that he was particularly vulnerable to use early signs of dis@@ content , and to use special officers to process opponents and to make them harm@@ less . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively short reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike the Lord Mel@@ es , who came out of the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia experienced such a revol@@ t in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , according to the information of analysts , apparently rejected by the government , and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; while the following ra@@ ids were killed , many prot@@ agoni@@ sts were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , as the new pend@@ ul@@ um train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ g@@ art of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; in the last month , prot@@ agoni@@ sts in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , led by Tig@@ ray conducted shops and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ ders over the neighbouring Somalia , even though she recently informed that she has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally collap@@ sed in a volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin gr@@ ate walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declar@@ es his asser@@ tion Barack Obama was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy on Friday that his multiple repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islam@@ ist state , not seriously meant . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication threw new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republi@@ can presidential candidates , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ able with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings its fellow workers who try to protect him during an event@@ ful phase of protection , in the peculiar position , to declare statements which he did not mean . &quot;
&quot; after having made the announcement at an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump in regards to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to indicate that he was really not intended , President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply s@@ ark@@ as@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; the post was contrary to the previous day , on which Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Tr@@ ump in a number of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation perfectly seriously . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump will help to we@@ aken the statement by saying that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism prev@@ ailed on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand figures on the economic situation . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this topic again .
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July he put strong criticism on himself when he thought the Russians should cho@@ ke Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons E@@ mails , but he later declared &quot; Natur@@ ally &quot; I told the s@@ ark@@ as@@ tical . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic limits in policy and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clear &quot; depending on how the reaction falls out . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communications expert , who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also think it &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of sharpen@@ ing the tone for presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an additional tone since his query results have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new poll of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , who was released on Friday , showed a leadership with great lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he is ampli@@ fied in the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps sh@@ ou@@ ted his loyal comrades into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ingly his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was interviewed for the correc@@ tness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had formed the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true that before Obama is an almost unknown , small organization , he called them amb@@ ass@@ adors , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he went off the troops out of Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Republi@@ cans are trying to argue that the government served as foreign minister to spread ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East , aggressive under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump sat down his attacks on the media and wor@@ shi@@ ped them on each of his words and being pre@@ occupied against him . &quot;
&quot; he conf@@ essed the poor , &quot; &quot; e@@ un@@ uch &quot; &quot; TV experts trying to understand and said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of the demo@@ crats were mo@@ cked by Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , as only one further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office . &quot;

&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a certified café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay a Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years a good coffee served for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store were pushed away . &quot;
&quot; soap Ch@@ erie , the Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local people smoked it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ack wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap store . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is change , it is also new invention . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened the last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing staff of old coffee shops , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és . &quot;
he began to work with Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a client offered to provide money for a new out@@ break , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept much . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for excav@@ ators bought the same es@@ pres@@ so model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment too .
he brought new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are yar@@ ns like cap@@ ers and s@@ auti@@ ously onions .
( users Viewing this Forum : 0 ) 1 1
&quot; the café serves no beer anymore , there are fresh ju@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a st@@ owed power of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers have also been forced through prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ vei@@ ra was such a client . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ vei@@ ra , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and regularly visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after they moved to Green@@ point , they would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb was closed , she gave a while the coffee @-@ ham , she said . &quot;
&quot; I realized that it was on the coffee and the culture of the verb that fell to me , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee , even though she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea instead of her usual Iced coffee . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
&quot; he went there before the work , and inevitably opposed to the same . &quot;
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients into the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he didn &apos;t have a gro@@ ll , that the soap business has taken the old business area . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the owner of the Soap Ch@@ erie provided a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bo@@ iled coffee of the caf@@ és as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has preferred to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighb@@ ors feel welcome . &quot;
the location has also further advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bo@@ iled coffee in the bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighboring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new version is enough to get their old favorites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was master &apos;s certificate and said that he was demoli@@ shed on the ground when the café was closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the entering of the restaurant and placing a new coff@@ ees was felt like a hom@@ ecom@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in a rich meal
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ en@@ sion to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a delic@@ acy , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a Fai@@ thful for refined delic@@ acies from Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Water Tur@@ tle Soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was a little more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato p@@ ure@@ e and as dessert a p@@ ure@@ a p@@ udding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man tells about life in a dwelling on the Lower East Side of the Lower East Side . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrated the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop for dinner , a small , snor@@ k@@ elling snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , set a cream cheese with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with potato p@@ ure@@ e and vegetable mixture . &quot;
&quot; as the reporter Hack@@ ening , this couple found the couple for discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver saus@@ age and bean bread . &quot;
&quot; they were prepared from an ingredient and a little bit cheap , which stretches the ingredient . &quot;
imagine to eat as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .

&quot; it must be in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women coo@@ ks for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pastry for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; they were the Americans , who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first World War . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , tense issue , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new Bud@@ get@@ te : mysterious food such as bread and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es as a &quot; wonderful way , food resi@@ dues , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , because coo@@ ks were able to hide in@@ appe@@ ti@@ zed ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
&quot; meat that was the center of the American kitchen for years , became a rarely ser@@ ene luxury . &quot;
homemade mix@@ tures were tried because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy dishes .
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions are not adap@@ table to each other .
it was typical for many of the farm recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , the household econom@@ ist - among them Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by making recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; bud@@ sman &quot; and the challenge to transform the r@@ amp like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ r@@ ots in delicious meals . &quot;
a Square Meal is a feast of historic treats .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he pra@@ ys the simple I@@ owa farmers cuisine of his kitchen , he feeds like the millions of millions of the world in which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked a continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a smoking .
he was wonderful real@@ ms .
&quot; President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt would have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have called him to stat@@ u@@ ate his stomach with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the hypo@@ crit@@ es of a house@@ keeper took no interest in fla@@ vors by Mrs. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial ones . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to foods . &quot;
the couple had better understood the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they did not know what to do , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; They made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was a drop in the wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they pulled up a dessert that they had prepared at home : the P@@ fl@@ au@@ m@@ end@@ ess@@ et , the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt ate at noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , and added that it was a common trick , modest recep@@ tions to be missed . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone has something reluct@@ antly a spoon in the teeth , brown limb@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , it didn &apos;t taste bad . &quot;
Co@@ E got three times a r@@ ash .

&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group who had saved life according to the image newspaper . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to draw people from torn houses , and to make the first aid in the war zone . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the vision of the group : a video of the Civil Guard , which shows him with a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a child from the ruins of a house , went to the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans for the shining symbol in the horror of the war .

&quot; shortly before O@@ mar fell victim to a victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria . &quot;

&quot; as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ timet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold to be sex@@ ually mature and its age with 156 years was determined , Gre@@ enland ha@@ y obviously has at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;

so they mature later - and al@@ tern slowly .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal leaves the heat . &quot;
the heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than at a gram of eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .

&quot; natural prot@@ ectors in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from being inhabited by people , they throw con@@ doms to them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der . &quot;
&quot; the method has proved effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years ago , has intensi@@ fied its promotion together with the US natural protection by using volunteers in villages in Northern Tanzania , a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and harvest without causing animals . &quot;

&quot; Jewish director zer@@ oes Berlin hotel , because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; request - RT News &quot;
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media uprising , after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bri@@ stol Hotel in Berlin did not have any Israeli pre @-@ election , since there were Arabic guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; took his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bri@@ stol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last visit , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s country selection list . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel is eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bri@@ stol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via an own Call Center . &quot;
&quot; after a statement , the director addressed the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; shocked him , &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the reason behind it was even more anger in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have asked that the pres@@ election will be deleted , &quot; was cited by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Had@@ as @-@ Handels@@ blatt , called this &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this is in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a rather big resonance on the Internet , in which people called the whole a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have been given the alleged invitation to Arab guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ash@@ amed &quot; &quot; was it in another post in which it was pointed out that the hotel that is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm is located near a syn@@ agogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel soon proved all accus@@ ations of himself and called &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not take into the quick@@ est list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reported a spokesman of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;

&quot; in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the commercial turn was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; for this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , Russian foreign nation@@ als were around 35@@ .000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourist resorts in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Irish tourists in Russia last year , said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;

Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the men team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame as the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , which his country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to E@@ iger , and made the legend proud to introduce a victory of the favourites of New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a sho@@ cking victory over four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick , after they were able to pick up a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in London . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ fahr@@ er Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a Hin@@ du .
Ho@@ ys Reti@@ rement has created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man when they stayed when they saw potential in the sh@@ all@@ ots that now un@@ folds .
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner scored a Olympic medal in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ alone rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders were vict@@ orious in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap slightly back after his lap , Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a great deal of transformation , with the Hin@@ des in a higher gear , to slow down it and make it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make a name .
we have set a Olympic Champion in the En@@ dr@@ unde and defeat the world champion .
it was just unbeliev@@ able .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 at the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ di gave him that he fell on the track after a weak start . &quot;
&quot; he passed this statement later , and there was no objection from England &apos;s ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; with such a superior victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It feels with all the GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une as London . &quot;
we have joined our team in the last three months .
we are so bad in so many world@@ titles so bad that it was unbeliev@@ able to win again at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , the seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ ys , it is in the area of the Mö@@ hr@@ ing that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would mean for Kenn@@ y - the exact 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal . &quot;
go to the top of the page
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two other gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal race of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll trained himself with the fastest performance in four @-@ four @-@ kilomet@@ re race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 . &quot;
&quot; the world record , won in 2012 in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1.6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
&quot; he had been accused of the qualification before the qualification , when it became function@@ aries to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding female competition , tomorrow continues and finished , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bark@@ er and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team relies on its strong web @-@ wheel team to dominate the middle ages of the Olympic Games and get a sc@@ ary to med@@ als .
&quot; after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; in the background , dr@@ amas were played in the background , so the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April is in the midst of sex@@ ism and bul@@ b@@ ing@@ cases , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like that the legendary call GB@@ s , which has reached the perfect moment its cli@@ max , will be repeated again . &quot;

&quot; the future of aluminium mel@@ mel@@ ts from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are on the game as the plant operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract , so that all delivery contracts will rise , such as the supplying energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years has expi@@ red in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are on the game .
no less than 2000 stations direct as well as indirect - could be endanger@@ ed at a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effect as the melting of around 10 per cent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
the melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risk a closure .
&quot; this step follows the many years of spec@@ ulation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting shop with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , divided up that three further owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is located in the majority property of a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company Ci@@ tic and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means that another physical demand for electricity by the melting means , &quot; distributed the company . &quot;
&quot; in addition , AG@@ L also said that the contracts were so called &quot; &quot; securing transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have been in force from November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 month period of notice , so that they will end 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from this point , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to income , &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
AG@@ L told that the value of the contracts had already been written in its annual salary in the amount of $ 187 million in the expect@@ ation of a termination .
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to reserve the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt , or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; is not imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that in 2010 had concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have been in power of November this year , even if there is still an explanation , why it has been with@@ drawn from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land consume about 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts each year . &quot;
&quot; should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator , it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; but even with the little chance that Ms. J@@ enner is described as the &quot; &quot; penetration model &quot; &quot; of their generation - under the previous category , it is in good company . &quot;
&quot; these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people , or reality stars or young people from today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it applies to J@@ enner ) . &quot;
they are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once who appeared on the last cover had appeared with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success . &quot;
&quot; with their reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called her &quot; the mist@@ ress of the eye . &quot; &quot;
these feelings co@@ sted high when the message came out with the appearing J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue cover .

&quot; the director of the Municip@@ ality Centre of Que@@ esland James Far@@ rell said that the last gathering of the National Union of Community centres resulted , that thousands of people were rejected every year . &quot;
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without the aboli@@ tion of the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be dismis@@ sed , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and overwhelming debt , families who have been dismis@@ sed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismis@@ sed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems legal way and this survey shows that they do not need to receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , which means thousands of hel@@ per people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we demand the General Attorney and Bundes@@ adjusting Minister , as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to raise these middle short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign was accused after co @-@ operation
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ activity , having been informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina in February has directed a fire@@ arm to a staff while they were in a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indict@@ ment that was filed on Wednesday in the Regional Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software program@@ er for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ini had been waiting for months to maintain that the matter would be regulated internally before it realised that &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , drew a pi@@ stol , put his right hands on the trigger , and steps the race in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; Bord@@ ini gave in his indict@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; after having compla@@ ined at the local and regional campaign line , Bord@@ ini decided that at least four more people had the same experience with Philli@@ p , he gave up the indict@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; weapons do not need to be fired , to arrange damage , &quot; &quot; Bord@@ ini gave . &quot;
&quot; the indict@@ ment is only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , when he was a crowd in North Carolina , said that &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; should take action if his rival should be elected by H@@ illary Clinton and judge judges . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign was clear that the media would have torn out his words out of the context and that he would not raise violence .
&quot; B@@ orda@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of due di@@ ligence , and Philip due to physical injury and lasting mental damage . &quot;

&quot; the &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in shops and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a couple of euros , lovers can buy the devices on the Internet , but they come somehow out of the stone age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover , as &quot; &quot; office in the west @-@ screen format &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards a lot : SMS and emails could be sent and received , also by fax , the Communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browsers , if you &apos;re moving slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; very proud was the prize : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euro . &quot;

England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country renewal and prosperity .
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , just as we were in London in 2012 when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great advantages to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities we will create 10,000 new teachers , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of the extension He@@ ath@@ row is too big . &quot;
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ end on the world stage .
&quot; in 2012 , they were wrong and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row . &quot;
&quot; there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ .000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to weather and to leave a legacy of skills and employment in both around the airport and across the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been transformed into a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T5 - the five @-@ year @-@ old airport terminal to T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row and create a legacy of skills and employment to England .

&quot; the incident occurred on the A1 , near Morges in the cant@@ on of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight . &quot;
&quot; a woman laid himself in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; &quot; on the street and were taken by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; Swiss Hemp Initiative , collecting signatures at Pal@@ eo @-@ Festival Nyon 2005 2004 &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already heard , but some are still not identified yet , the police told them as well as any witness of the incident . &quot;
&quot; a investig@@ ative process was opened , which was a logical step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter told the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen if one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a collision avo@@ idable ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not responsible for the responsibility .
&quot; in each of the two cases - where one person in the Dun@@ es went on the highway , it was decided that the drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year a polic@@ eman was acqu@@ itted of negli@@ gent murder after she had transferred a man and killed , who was lying in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk , and has become un@@ conscious of the street , and took the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the court ordered that the polic@@ eman had responded to an emergency call -- in a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely exceptional and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report on the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA &apos;s climate model : Venus was once resident
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate , Venus was probably inhab@@ itable . &quot;
&quot; scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms , similar to those of climate research . &quot;
&quot; the model was designed to determine if the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere could have had similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have pointed out that the slow re@@ rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , a similar atmosphere , and nevertheless slowly turned on . &quot;
the model illuminated also the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably proved more dry areas than the earth , but had once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected against evap@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; the early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent matter . &quot;
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow re@@ petition of Venus was almost two months long , &quot; &quot; explained G@@ ISS Scienti@@ Anthony Del Gen@@ io , in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which creates a rain@@ shield to shield the surface of a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are more cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model brought a story of Venus that resem@@ bles evolution previously thought by plan@@ etary researchers .
&quot; although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billion years --@@ too much heat and ultra@@ violet light was exposed . &quot;
their oc@@ eans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ our was fired from the ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as you hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was with@@ drawn with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy is back as coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy joined the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the club will immediately search for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and certainty , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy was in a position . &quot;
&quot; in the course of summer , I thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , that it needs and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the vision of the coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations has to be perfectly matched to the organization &apos;s organisation . &quot;
he must also have a right of determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met at the moment .
&quot; on May 23 , 2013 , Sak@@ ic , the Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the best coach of the league during his debut season at A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 .
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed last season in each of the two last years . &quot;
&quot; in the 2015 @-@ 16 season , the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the game for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference for five points . &quot;

strikes against the oil field service Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the process of the current dispute , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
we will hold a few full @-@ day meetings in the next few weeks that will start the next year to re@@ join the problems .
&quot; the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has short@@ ened the rates to its shareholders in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
the company said that additional cuts in the company have the required space to get through the market .

&quot; due to the lower crude oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation which was strengthened by the British decision of the British in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders in the beginning of this week , to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes which took place since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need a economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion has been anticipated for new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the stars of the Ple@@ j@@ ade .
&quot; the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in clusters rot@@ ates at different rates , as well as in which connection to the rot@@ ational periods with plan@@ etary designs . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other clusters , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of his solar system , Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the cluster cluster of the ple@@ j@@ ades is 4@@ 45 years of light from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this star cluster , which originated in front of about 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they turn right now on the fastest .
&quot; at peak levels , these mature stars hit large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a slow down effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; if a star fails , its rotation speed begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of any star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearing of a recogni@@ zable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that more massive stars are more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower than smaller pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Bal@@ let &quot; of the ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the cluster cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we would like to learn more about how the how , wh@@ ann and why stars slow@@ ed down their red rates and so to speak their &quot; &quot; dancing shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the press rates of the ple@@ j@@ ades that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;

&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked up for 211 parti@@ tions due to a winding in the so @-@ called bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the principal suspect to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the league could even have done a favor for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time . &quot;
&quot; even his f@@ arewell days are not silent , too . &quot;
&quot; during many bas@@ eball le@@ gends in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit frequently on the bench . &quot;

&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) , the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing is requested . &quot;
&quot; the national association take the issue &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; commented X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court of CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , it is no longer the I@@ OC but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; in the night of Rio , the news about the positive sample of Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an unbeliev@@ able shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we are under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
&quot; in this way , approximately all weight li@@ fters may not take part in Rio de Janeiro &apos;s chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation . &quot;

&quot; the world association IA@@ AF made the entire Russian team until an exception for systematic dop@@ ing the start , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;

relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening you walk around etern@@ ally , at night you wake up for hours , in the morning , you can &apos;t think about sleeping in the morning . &quot;
this is everything else than a relaxing .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disturb@@ ances occur ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and they can be based on many causes , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter we@@ aves , member of the Board member of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; but the In@@ som@@ nia , therefore , is a single and sleeping disorder . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; this can be done from your control panel . if your company is not yet listed , you need to make a listing first . &quot;
not rare is the sleep disturb@@ ance expression of another disease .
&quot; very early wake up is often common in depression , &quot; he says . &quot;
and it can be that different factors meet each other .
&quot; who , for example , has a disc disc case , can lie poor@@ ly , w@@ akes every two to three hours and starts to gre@@ et about everyday problems and -@@ worry , there is an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should one go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
&quot; who will not sleep well over a month in at least three nights a week , and is affected by the day , should go to the doctor , advis@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the im@@ pair@@ ment can be quite different : one is beaten , tired , asleep , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in order to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleep disturb@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or also medicines - classical sle@@ ft@@ ab@@ let@@ ins only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , you should first contact the home@@ owner in case of sleeping problems . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied if the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to the Schla@@ fl@@ ab@@ or , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is not necessary to prepare for the examination . &quot;
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a lunch break , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the wiring , one goes into bed at its normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a s@@ ungl@@ asses , a chest strap and a feel@@ er on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a camera on the ceiling to sleep . &quot;
who are you ? ( optional ) Your name ( or alias ) : &#91; sign In &#93;
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep .
&quot; it counts on : regular dor@@ mit@@ ory and standing times , not too long in bed , not watching TV to sleep , not watching TV to sleep , alcohol avoid and at night not at the clock - then one starts to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not convey@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; in the first glance , the R@@ ī@@ ga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not work on the first glance , but the police count them to the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you go along the road from the east to the west , you come to play areas , a snow@@ y kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; on the facade of a gray house someone &quot; &quot; ugly &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demoli@@ shed , it is already built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new ten@@ ants will be created . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain is , however , fav@@ oured with burning cars in the last weeks . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents of rental contracts , on the ground floor , are still occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator H@@ enkel was particularly pronounced for a hard action of the police against the project , the area as &quot; No @-@ go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous force . &quot;
&quot; on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ ter@@ s@@ mi@@ ths with 300 police officers were cleared , pat@@ rol the police three weeks of official statements , with 30 to 40 officers and three crew wag@@ ons on site , locked parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , renov@@ ating construction workers in the order of the unknown house owners have the premises . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance was illegal and a day later police and construction workers went under the jubil@@ ee of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; in this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful : parents walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are enter@@ tained by late i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are located . &quot;
&quot; it is not the main cause of many n@@ atives : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who likes three children here , are mainly generated by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the house projects , they share the concern for rising rent and centr@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted to bring about a majority of police protection from the front of the Left . &quot;
&quot; the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police between the house@@ keeper and their neighbours , does not exist . &quot;
&quot; in the east of Berlin , Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain was a traditional working district , which also has a lower average of poverty and a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer Straße very close to Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared on a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga , and partly inhabited by the people they had occupied for 26 years ago . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them on s@@ worn disks or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were disc@@ arded with color bags . &quot;
no other road was mentioned so often with the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence . &quot;
&quot; a reason for that not all neighb@@ ors could see this as a problem , that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like body injury are based on statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the biggest part of criminal off@@ ences make property damage , which tend to make new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , may be no question of in@@ security . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is important : the people in 94 are their neighb@@ ors , who have not been determined . &quot;
&quot; even the famous burning cars give it no longer any longer in the Riga , even longer . &quot;
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more with each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
&quot; for this reason , it was also so important that local residents have returned to their streets : from the police , politics and media that suddenly claim the interpretation of the district in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by scre@@ ened new buildings in former building blocks , which will impose the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many here - here , rather people who are not so well bet@@ u@@ rous , &quot; she says . &quot;
violence and destruction can I do absolutely not thei@@ rs .
but what should be done if someone li@@ stens to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides of fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Ker@@ stin had a little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who gets up , should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub , badly complain about noise . &quot;
all persons with first names are asked not to be named with their right name .

it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
you need to accommodate the refugees in your own or rented premises .
&quot; the costs for construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves . &quot;

&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been quite difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to does not find private apartments .
&quot; it does not work so far , but be dependent on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments have to be paid , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , new containers will soon be placed in the Was@@ enstraße . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; as a result , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a firm lead , there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and job activities for refugees and migrants who have to be und@@ am@@ aged or set up . &quot;
&quot; more seats would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house master , do non @-@ profit work - and that motivated and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , activity does not mean work . &quot;
&quot; the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and the client . &quot;
people need to develop a feeling of belonging .
&quot; so I need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , here are administration and volunteers . &quot;
it is central that refugees feel the feeling they are in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they have to explain the refugees that it is just going to bridge the time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who at some point develop the feeling that he could not help in Ur@@ bach nobody , should not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the client is therefore always , to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
&quot; this is a &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : have the two following the most recent results fear of radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; what some na@@ ï@@ f might call . &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers have already been sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they want to show that they do nothing , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so we have to look at the main and volunteers on the spot and in the region after activities .
&quot; in the background , they always have a new impact on refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need an upper limit ?
this question is clear to answer .
&quot; actually , it &apos;s unfair to put them on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach , we haven &apos;t arrived there where we would like , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach will also be able to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way .
