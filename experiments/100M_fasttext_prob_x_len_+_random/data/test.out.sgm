<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter-player in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palastes, I cannot say that Ankara wants this reconciliation to most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was a handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile appeared, and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, talked about his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even be improved."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on the next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan was so pleased that Erdogan would never have happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin radiant, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Days of Moscow to Be Held in 2015 Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin and Mayor of Tel Aviv Ron Huldai agreed to collaborate in tourism and security.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to be in the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was even bigger since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">"it is difficult, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media conducted a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"at the serious test, the accusations of leading officials, that Erdogan would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has disputed this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin had received the excuse that he wanted to hear from the President Erdogan."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire is clear on the hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily a member of all the friends he can get after the last month in a failed coup d'état.</seg>
<seg id="28">"on the other hand, terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him."</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights will be taken back."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week forecast the state television cheaper fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemographic sti formulated it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West because it's reaction to the attempted power transfer as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the ongoing groll of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the piracy is to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian state of State won a bonus that he called for the attempted coup of government support for the elected state organs."</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow a matter of course that even has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this bright palace on the sea led to Russia and Turkey, one of how to portray an analyst once described as an analyst," Alliance of foreign ages ": two countries that violate themselves from the West and then burned down badly."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently made the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be noted that after almost three hours of initial discussions both presidents spoke at the press conference that they had not stopped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the president of Turkey missed it on a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disappearance, when NATO member Turkey crashed the Russian fighter - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State will at least talk to each other."</seg>

<seg id="5">"in a statement of the Kremlin, Putin has ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who was Vice President since 2012 Ivanovs, was appointed to his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 1972, in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he made his degree at the prestigious State of Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it is (in Russian) that he later became a leader and head of the government staff later."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said to Putin," "thank you for your confidence." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state in regards to draft bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and Vaino recommended as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest confiding Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin who was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff appeared on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, just a few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">"so, here is the result of a kind of power struggle?"</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no translations available.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official claim - that a man who was once preferred as potential President, would like to lead to the Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," It's true that I asked you in the beginning of 2012 in a conversation with me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former Member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project should be completed until May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North deck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fever.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four lockings of the" "ceiling fan", "which is the completion for each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge-cut of Fife is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 inclined ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown provided a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first, which went from the country to the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, nearly 79% of the total bridge decks at their place and the last section of the deck gets a bed for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this fantastic project, the closure is the future-proof high and low construction."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installation of the last street section and its connection with the Nordturmdeck, we had to close the existing gap on the North or land side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the norament bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled upwards of approx. 3% upwards."</seg>
<seg id="19">"as the tolerances to which the team works, they were tiny - on each side they ruined only a few millimetres."</seg>

<seg id="4">"the SPD proposes a" "Action Plan" "for the next council meeting."</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first of all, it is about the question: who should actually build the inexpensive apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the SPD leader Christoph Bratmann says:" "we agree with the Greens:" "who wants to build on urban areas, will need 20 per cent of all dwellings as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the favorable apartments can also be built in the stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the major issue in the town hall was, however, so Bratmann:" how do you go with investors that want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors on such areas at least 10 percent, but as 20 percent of the apartments build as social apartments."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban building subsidy programme, which will cost millions of costs and will still be financed, should provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, so Bratmann:" there are currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>

<seg id="16">"in spite of its, so Bratmann, a merciless of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the building management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but still, the program is not entirely different: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built already anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of more about 1300 favorable apartments which will run in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020, it will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planetary spreader, Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city."</seg>

<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>

<seg id="27">Because in the western city the end of the year is the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be found there in the price range for cheap apartments.</seg>

<seg id="2">It's fascinating to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the last decade, teenagers and children don't want to play outdoors, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, the last decade has been complained of many."</seg>
<seg id="4">"at Pokemon go, it's about to get people from the sofa and get more active."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time at the screen was initially on television, then on video games and last on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other."</seg>
<seg id="7">"I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were created for video games in the 1990ies (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"how many phenomena of pop culture dropped interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">America's strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans-Atlantic security partnership</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, the players go outside and search for Pokémons that are followed by a GPS and once they have been found," "photographed" "(about a screenshot on the phone) or" "captured". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was still younger, lock down the track and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in increments that the" average "person recovers every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed the 35.000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to bring about 30 minutes of time," "from the sofa" "and" "to be active every day", "because many public messages are boring and come from people coming out."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">"who drives regularly sports, reduces its chances of getting cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that people can do something outdoors so that they have fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people join the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also mashed tokens that have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough for itself.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps like Fitbit have already been able to follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">"the new will lose its appeal, and the use will be followed by time."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons's success there will be more games, the apps and virtual reality will be united in the real world and will help many people on hunt, active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone and Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the women's olympiamity in the gymnastics and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US had never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"and secondly: this team has three turbines, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewish is and Madison Kocian, the Catholicon, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has strengthened the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among the female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">"last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2."</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the last Olympic games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising winner of the Olympic medallions and America."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected yet masterly Gymastics routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold in an individual event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but we do not see gyms throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it to the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">It is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality looks so that Turns are an expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents, which will be maintained by parents for training, setup, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both her athletes since they started with the turnes."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to make the churches aun innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, enable a more efficient and easy-to-access training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded my gymnasium for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in my events, we have free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urbane young people (especially black and hispani) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high-quality gymnastics, which make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and certainty for the spirit."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it is the inspiration of this team, bringing thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great."</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true presentation of" Girl Power "through the Holen of Olympic clubteam golds and thank you so many young girls with a different background to start their way to start healthy, strong, and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the leaders of instructors to prove the identity"</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we talked with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, to find out how to walk around with armed robbers."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how you turn around the spear for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"when you get back from behind, you should turn around as a first, so that you can see your attacker and go out of the line," says Mizrachi. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your foreararm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"beat him with his knees and turn away while the attacker fights against pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they align the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when attacker, approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line, take the weapon and turn it so that the attacker cannot shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, store the weight on the weapon and beat the attacker to the chest, then turn the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on it."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and worsening of a serious test - by taking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and the author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk schach his course on a euro note, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a flush button of a train toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before removing any object, it used a luminometer to show up and show us what it is going on."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, the purge button of a pull toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he was distracted, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance capability of his darms by moving through the world and ate wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Wednesday, 18.February2016 You are not logged in... [Log In]"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to meet his call in any case."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he read was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His probeading showed a luminometry number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminometry number is freshly washed hands less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to evacuate after their luminometres were more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", "which shows the bacteria count in various places like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "This is the worst thing I have done in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company dedicated Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we carried out crazy Brainstorming sessions that ended that we said" "Lass us Ian." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with the documentary film, we were able to provide consumers more information on an interesting way."</seg>
<seg id="29">I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film directed by the film, added:" let me say - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he would have liked to check out some of the things I have instructed to him, as the eclectic Russian toilet which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to bring them down, and others, where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>

<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a humble grey suit, and a little bit of writing like:" so, let's throw a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Sohos slowly emerges slowly on its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill up the building in which once independent vendors were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic record stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera to turn the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I am of Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle age) to Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around 20), is a day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, ask me?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3.000 or 4,000 sheets."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these sound boards, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by E-Mail, I'm not followed by the house), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when they appeared and once again buy items he sold when he was young and helpful."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60ies, early 70ies, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things, where I was probably something too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"it is true that those who buy plates are rather introverted and gladly spend their time, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard of the media, people who have heard about the comeback and prompted themselves to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"by the conversations I have led, people usually have discharged their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their CDs, so he says."</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to supporters of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to see that record stores offers a soothing community of equality.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers took an impetus to the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to return to the stability of familiar noise platforms, from objects, the happier itching innerware."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material poser than a kind of comfort," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">That's me as a collector so I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to think spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April reveal that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month, they haven't heard them yet."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey found that 41% have a record player, which they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, do not own record players."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at that time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while I blur through a stack of Bossa Nova Kompilots."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men mean age) has noticed a" "trophy aspect" "of the Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead sound board so that I can put them into the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product information, less music-like."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they are younger people, not older ones who only come from slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, dedicated to the soundboards almost a whole floor, has a blower audience than I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women middle ages."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores, Wild Beasts newer synthesizer and sexually packs pop instead of experimental jazz drills from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"no one of them looks strange, but nagging mental traumata are difficult to determine if one stands beside someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around a few minutes in business and looks at the variety of plates for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">You tend to be a female mannequin than a large purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"they do not deserve much, therefore the collecting of plates is no real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or another way, but the beauty of plates is..."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the appearance to muck the jeans area, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "panel art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"however, considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and to send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most for luxury objects such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bummings through record stores of the Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they are standing at the staring view of an unsecret, 30-year false presenter, who goes on the shoulders of nothing of middle-aged men over the shoulders."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected a quotation of the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in case of a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state was supposed to sell 72 provisional transactions in which people sell goods, cigarettes to Energydrinks, selling, hairdressing services or to sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that of a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups will not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the allocation of people who run the 72 provisional transactions, but routed that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely comprehensible."</seg>

<seg id="4">"there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams was in a row, the first women in the history of the British Sports, which put on such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolutely, after all, their claws unfolded, which is also exemplary."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant athletes, which glides over the surface with the elegance of plans, which is not reflected in the type of triumphal."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in rowing, a battalion is an willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that make the difference and it was no more comfortable than the coach who would survive this day if he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he was risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had a bladder cancer, which is operable and they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do this, it spreads out everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, what the interruption was to a minimum if that was the right concept under such circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better again soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the rowing of itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the impairability of the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who had a nerve-writable morning, spent more than usual and tried to handle his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Stanning, which was the captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "I was an emotional wreck this week. it might be something extreme, but it means so much."</seg>

<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin would we be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach of the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person for exercising or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>

<seg id="33">"we didn't want a firework today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race what we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>

<seg id="8">"by regular compositions, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"social and family structures often solve the age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "speak and organize themselves to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the positive sense, Hackler writes."</seg>

<seg id="16">"in the older generations, the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to the everyday life, both in the school and in leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observed that singing or listening of songs with older people aroused many memories, often associated with positive feelings of her youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"by Liedell and especially melodies, even demenzdiseased men were recalled at long back events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also demands a special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time concentrating on their own voice and to a predetermined rhythm, and to adapt to the other singers - this is a big cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially older people, who live alone, do not only concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, writes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"even if I have a long time for something, I will be better and alert beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to begin with singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try out a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he thinks that little talent advises Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound comes next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone comes from the well-known circle in a senior enchantment, you can easily connect."</seg>

<seg id="3">"protesters who demand political changes in Ethiopia, ate on violent resistance in the government."</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that seventy protagonists were killed during clashes with the police during firing.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests against the government were shaken by the government, and far more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people collapsed on the streets and long-held fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer to the government was unmerciful according to human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as a result, police officers were killed and killed in a number of unarmed demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">ISO-8859-3 (Southern Europe) iso-8859-5 (Cyrillic) iso-8859-6-i (Arabic)</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated from the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopia to fight terrorism over the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued the suppression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents have been effective."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or prison, put into prison or put into the desert of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and do not have any other options except protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopien. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protruding.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the floor use to the worsening of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions are rising along the border to Eritrea; a fight for these zacky, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were more or less forced to use the turbulence, could be armed and armed."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of incision are now exploding under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, mostly at protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they keep up."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians demanded that they gathered themselves as protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since aeons, the amharas that come from Ethiopia are predominantly Christian high-countries, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But that is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are in co-ordinating under a screen," Mulatu Gemechu said, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which is dominated by around 6 per cent of the population and that are dominant in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was particularly vulnerable to use early signs of discontent, and to use special officers to process opponents and to make them harmless."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," Mr. Abdi said, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively short reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike the Lord Meles, who came out of the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia experienced such a revolt in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, according to the information of analysts, apparently rejected by the government, and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"while the following raids were killed, many protagonists were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, as the new pendulum train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misgart of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"in the last month, protagonists in Gondar, an amharan city, led by Tigray conducted shops and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenders over the neighbouring Somalia, even though she recently informed that she has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally collapsed in a volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this" "said Mr. Abdi," "is a very thin grate walk."</seg>

<seg id="14">"at the end of July he put strong criticism on himself when he thought the Russians should choke Mrs. Clintons Emails, but he later declared" Naturally "I told the sarkastical."</seg>

<seg id="17">"but I also think it's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of sharpening the tone for presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an additional tone since his query results have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new poll of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, who was released on Friday, showed a leadership with great lead in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics to distort his statements or to understand his humor."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the future of aluminium melmelts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are on the game as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract, so that all delivery contracts will rise, such as the supplying energy companies."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step was followed by the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies for the operation of the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years has expired in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 stations direct as well as indirect - could be endangered at a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effect as the melting of around 10 per cent of the total electricity generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014 Alcoa concluded the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power station last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risk a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the many years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting shop with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, divided up that three further owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is located in the majority property of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, the Chinese company Citic and the Japanese Marubeni Corp."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means that another physical demand for electricity by the melting means," distributed the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"in addition, AGL also said that the contracts were so called" "securing transactions", "which should have been in force from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a 12 month period of notice, so that they will end 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"from this point, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to income," "said the electricity supplier."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL told that the value of the contracts had already been written in its annual salary in the amount of $187 million in the expectation of a termination.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to reserve the contracts, the" ability Alcoas... to operate the melt, or to ensure the power supply to the melt "is not impaired."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that in 2010 had concluded a 20 year contract with Loy Yang, who should have been in power of November this year, even if there is still an explanation, why it has been withdrawn from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consume about 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts each year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"should both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate, Venus was probably inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">"scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms, similar to those of climate research."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine if the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere could have had similar conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have pointed out that the slow rerotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, a similar atmosphere, and nevertheless slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model illuminated also the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably proved more dry areas than the earth, but had once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected against evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent matter."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow repetition of Venus was almost two months long," "explained GISS ScientiAnthony Del Genio, in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which creates a rainshield to shield the surface of a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are more cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a story of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably inhabitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years --too much heat and ultraviolet light was exposed."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was fired from the ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="31">"for this reason, it was also so important that local residents have returned to their streets: from the police, politics and media that suddenly claim the interpretation of the district in July."</seg>
