Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement and T@@ ehr@@ an dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution would be discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been tense for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement construction of Israel and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; through the deal of the Obama designated deal to the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two continues to deteri@@ orate . &quot;
&quot; in March Net@@ any@@ ahu held a cont@@ enti@@ ous speech at the invitation of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was held in part as Aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , but a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election of the election in Israel . &quot;

&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was knot@@ ted on a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb who had travelled to the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot and killed by the police . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ ti@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb has made the fatal emergency call at some point later .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : lamb took life when the police interven@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; one day after shooting at the university , students and instruc@@ tors forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details of the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state published details , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students told us that they were fre@@ ed up for his lessons .
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned the book written in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations for problematic behavi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb praised , said he seemed a bit nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he had told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Delta State University has asked the Delta State University to have a passport for health reasons and said that he had any health problem . &quot;
&quot; this year , he only taught two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy mean that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would no guarantee for an automatic path to a position as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; he said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
there are questions that do not answer the Lamb .
&quot; after fle@@ eing from the campus , police subsequently found the Lam@@ bs track when he went back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , told Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car ran in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , he started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he had a doctor@@ ate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the many years of Friend@@ ship Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met together with friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing . &quot;
he was the women &apos;s s@@ warm at that time .
&quot; all girls sm@@ ashed there when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
the Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss obviously had some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house that borders on a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was ok .
&quot; the former husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter , which was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was completely destroyed at the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both on a summer @-@ tree , three years ago . &quot;
&quot; later , they played together one or another gig . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter wrote and sings her own music . &quot;

&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a Bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes Entertainment Co@@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 September for the last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic play in front of a festive audience . &quot;
there were no signs that anything did not vote .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and sh@@ attered together .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense for sh@@ ear . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the tot@@ e professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American n@@ atives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his brother and the student committee .
&quot; on the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and took about 900 people , including lect@@ urers , staff , students and members of the municipality at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial . &quot;

&quot; Associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb was shot after he shot himself , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss himself described as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever been married . &quot;
Toys R Us are planning to set up less workforce for the Christmas time
Toys R Us say that it &apos;s not so many Christmas season employees like last year but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give a chance to work more hours on his employees and seasonal workers .

Poroshenko to speak at UN General Assembly meeting dedicated to large movements of refugees
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says , its response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief asks again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , UK and France - on the br@@ ink of the General Assembly of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he lam@@ ented that the divisions in the Council and the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban called on five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in dealing with Iran in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .

some have tried to brand him as a flo@@ p .
others have done him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how few Rep@@ ublic@@ ans attempt to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously consider what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate agency . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts stress that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was given leadership to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , none of whom won &apos;t even won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside @-@ zone groups like J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group club for Growth have now recogni@@ zing Tr@@ um@@ ps through staying power and start to run their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the Real Estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
Â© Warner Bros@@ . Entertainment Inc .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
and these figures remain in the early states .
a qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good view of Tr@@ ump .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in a survey conducted by CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next thing to do with enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 per cent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can elect@@ ors say they would &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favourite of the establishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters voted for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to have the right tem@@ per for an President , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ over , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent believe that he did not have the personality to perform effectively his ministry , and almost six of ten independent people say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the idea .
&quot; when they apply their honor@@ able hats , Republi@@ can voters pun@@ ishes Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week , four of ten out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July their money came to J@@ eb Bush .
firm of the Year for Insolven@@ cy Administration Schneider Gei@@ witz &amp; Partner Firm of the Year for Tax Glei@@ ss Lutz
&quot; at that time in the final cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans considered Rick Perry win the nom@@ ination for only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump hits almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts suggest that the split field is likely to contribute to tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed over a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head @-@ at @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump backs multi @-@ majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ es and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypothetical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a strong majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new poll conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that there is only a little more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump , say they have given their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say never to change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since then , Donald Tr@@ ump called immigrants from Mexico after two months of immigrants from Mexico . &quot;
&quot; some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic pron@@ o@@ unc@@ ement of Tr@@ ump @-@ crucial His@@ p@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party , and damage the re@@ orientation efforts . &quot;
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; as long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump apparently will also do it . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s up to new heights .
&quot; on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , around half of Republi@@ can voters support Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also fur@@ ious in Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Prime Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; wooden off@@ ences . &quot;

a lucky hit by Thomas MÃ¼ller made the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a confident opening of the Champions League season .
&quot; the World Champion Thomas MÃ¼ller and Mario GÃ¶t@@ ze got a dream start in the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; Hex@@ enk@@ essel from Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; the twel@@ fth start of the series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t after Munich . &quot;
&quot; MÃ¼ller received his 28th hit in the Champions League to Bavaria @-@ leadership of the Olympic Games Tor@@ wart Roberto , who caused a shot of the world champion as a flan@@ ks . &quot;

&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; but the Bavaria , in seven euro@@ scep@@ tic du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , with their aggressive endeav@@ ors but often too in@@ hibited . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by playing wareh@@ ous@@ ing on left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which was rarely passed by the former Braunschweig O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ del@@ la@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
&quot; MÃ¼ller had more luck from the right , when his flank was hit from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ que . &quot;
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion the potential 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; said S Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Mal@@ m@@ strÃ¶m stated . &quot;
the Swe@@ de decided to introduce the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
the German government announced assistance .
&quot; by the TTIP , the largest free trade zone of the world is to develop over 800 million people . &quot;
the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings specifically see that the EU states and the United States can jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they are to come from the EU , the USA and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned . &quot;
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ g@@ ments .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ce
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut in the Fra@@ gran@@ unde of the Prime Minister is expected with excitement since its election .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut at the Prime Minister Fra@@ grant and put himself in place for the first time with David Cameron .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to make the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch , and his performance by the media is likely to be examined by the Labour ME@@ Ps . &quot;
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the cabinet affairs and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ises criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the centre of several Tit@@ els@@ berg stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his beliefs that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in the economy , defense and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t states that political differences are also st@@ acked within the Labour &quot; &quot; and after Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statement on the position of the European Union and the limitation among women . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes take place in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; Mr Smith , the shadow of work and minister minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 Â£ to Â£ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has since he has T@@ ory boss , over the last decade , over the Dis@@ patch in parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader who promised a different policy approach , says he has &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Icel@@ an@@ dic North MP said that the fac@@ tions of the prime minister is too con@@ front@@ ative , and that it is both &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ fe with an ad@@ versary , and has taken place instead to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economy minister , will be represented in him if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is on the road . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in style of a &quot; Kasper@@ l @-@ theatre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since it was broadcast on TV first in 1990 , the question@@ nai@@ res were considered as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position under his parliam@@ ents , although critics argue that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need extensive reforms . &quot;

Met@@ amor@@ pho@@ sis attempts to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an al@@ di attack in South Australia and Western Australia .
F@@ cash has launched a campaign campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailer in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia beginning next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA dealer and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA @-@ stores samples and sell store owners to sell the cheapest tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will be published more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ alers of food , alcohol and devices will carry out its annual investor strategy day . &quot;
there is a lot on the game since South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA store transactions and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the East states .
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious province and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern Australia . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gi@@ os and deserves the opinion of the President of the Australian tennis board Steve He@@ aly rather praise as criticism for his own behavior . &quot;
&quot; the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; was accompanied by the not@@ orious history of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying session in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbitr@@ ator , and Har@@ rison had to hit Cy@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp@@ f was def@@ ended by Richard Gas@@ quet &apos;s potential U.S. Open victory , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I am quite en@@ vious , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little in the dispute , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a bat when he lost due to a cr@@ amp@@ age in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he &apos;s extremely well beha@@ ved in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around and I think he was a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very rei@@ fer 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os in the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man out of Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is fully concentrated on the competition and not all around the con@@ dens@@ ation round &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he rises in the eyes of the public and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his action . &quot;

&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were seeking refuge in excess of Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be achieved that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; in Hungary , however , Hungary replaced its hopes on a bal@@ eful action of Brussels or from its neighb@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , there were more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and accelerate asylum proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a barb@@ ed wire along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has finished a fence on the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons were deployed in the race , barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major shortage of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , among them Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which entered into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 metre ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia . these laws also place higher sti@@ cking punishment for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es state of emergency , &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs re@@ or@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the parliament has to agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters of Associated Press have already seen in the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Landes @-@ Security Advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities found 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others have already entered the country . &quot;
&quot; they come up by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of being accused of criminal off@@ ences following the new laws . &quot;
authorities are to repair the fence .
&quot; Hungarian officials concluded on Tuesday morning , two of the seven border cros@@ sings with Serbia after a train wagon with barb@@ ed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos ren@@ ders the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and pushed a crowd to press down there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands stayed outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they arrive to Hungary .

&quot; the former U.S. Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton also holds a double @-@ digit lead in democratic race to nom@@ ination on national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite to the ground . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is a presidential candidate for the presi@@ dency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Cl@@ int@@ ons supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; Clinton keeps a big lead in women and v@@ ines , but these proj@@ ections have decreased . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ int@@ ons &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has van@@ ished , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton has a big advantage in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters voted nationwide that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton , if they would be nominated by the party . &quot;

&quot; if Cl@@ int@@ ons supporters are asked in an open question , why they want the candidate is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Cl@@ int@@ ons supporters will also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
&quot; in addition , quot@@ ing of your company at the Spon@@ sors board of the conference Conditions &quot;
&quot; as the Vice @-@ President th@@ rows a potential for the presi@@ dency office into the scales , 57 per cent of the democratic voters will see him in the race - although one @-@ third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters choose the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
Cl@@ int@@ ons &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far before S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den is not eligible for nom@@ ination of demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage above S@@ anders has increased from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;

&quot; bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; is increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important in one candidate , Democratic elect@@ ors call on the vot@@ e@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; similarly , as in the last month , no one democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters chose the elections as un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates perform good results in some important features in some of the choices of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; for the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts the best of hon@@ esty while Cl@@ int@@ ons &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;

&quot; democratic voters in the elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about H@@ illary cl@@ int@@ ons are continuing to use a personal email address and a server during the term of office as an Foreign Minister , most demo@@ cra@@ cies of the pro @-@ elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say they did not affect their opinions . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public altogether .

&quot; the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;

five members of Brotherhood &apos;s death bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Neul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student during a ra@@ iny ritual when a student engagement in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , Mord@@ ank@@ ees were filed against five people . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood seized Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport into the hospital which contributed to his death .
&quot; officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 pound back@@ pack filled with sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a goal . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood do not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g became power@@ less and supposed to wait an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to switch to D@@ eng@@ s clothing to get his symptoms goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members , tools to hide and set the good of the Brotherhood in general about that by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ ti@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ve , and he died next morning at his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , den@@ g repeated with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ ig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the Sch@@ ik@@ anen since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indict@@ ment for the murder of the third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
&quot; thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with criminal attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has officially been sanc@@ tioned - officially or in@@ officially - this will be added to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; interest income comes , and the house will get into the banks , returns to bonds , and the economy will gli@@ de into a recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance on the process . &quot;
a recession occurred within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments are responding . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US central bank have stressed that investors should not concentrate when it starts to increase interest rates but rather on the period required for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;

&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effects . &quot;
here is a view on historical trends which could react to some areas of the economy :
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency for investments from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may perhaps reflected the delay in monetary policy , said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle , and the return on return will begin to decrease . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not happen before and which could ha@@ sten a recession . &quot;

&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schwa@@ b believe that the increase in the interest rates will lead to closer cooperation between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a defl@@ ation of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high interest rates often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher earnings , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fixed @-@ Income Analysis in Schwa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
Jones believes that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in large and whole businesses , companies that are able to handle the larger part of their business operations in the U.S. can benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;

&quot; in the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the sick that was brought into an inner court of the Great Mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the h@@ add@@ led , who later took place in this month , gathered themselves together . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal de@@ ret also t@@ ad@@ owed the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because they did not cooperate with met@@ eor@@ ologists .

the Bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an isolated son who was kidn@@ apped by the family in the 1990 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; the collapse of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is needed at least once in the life of every healthy man . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
&quot; government officials say that 1 million Ri@@ al ( Â£ 17@@ 4,000 ) paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;
other injured will receive half of this amount .

time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note bank
&quot; the world is watching when the U.S. bank@@ note bank has come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , which were questioned by Reuters , found that a little more than half the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it is seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest continued to NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , chief personnel at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tr@@ illion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less strict outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the indications suggest that the chances for such a step are good . &quot;
the decision shall be announced at 8 p.m. ME@@ Z on Thursday

&quot; after shooting and killing his friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi am Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues on the day and killed him - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that it was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , teacher for geography and social scientific education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , he shot himself and killed someone . &quot;
&quot; he said that the police officers had to send police to his home , and the staff of the emergency call centre reported that the police had to send police officers to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but it is likely to be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he didn &apos;t give him . &quot;
Lamb was no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as a police scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it . &quot;
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb landed 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening as polic@@ eman killed him . &quot;
&quot; he said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb claimed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who testi@@ fied that she was married for seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have had a daughter that is 19 , and she was destroyed on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; she has been working online at home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met for about three years with Lamb . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lamb has inv@@ oked relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he does not go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ eman took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later at that night , he drove his car to the side , fled into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brings the left outer defense to we@@ eping and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by HÃ©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then fantastic plays , and then this happens . &quot;
&quot; in the locker room , he had an oxygen mask . &quot;
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I don &apos;t have a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then the six months , and he will not play in the group stage . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape a red card and the suspension of an i@@ vory .
&quot; Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arb@@ iter had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an i@@ ret and a red card are pr@@ one .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; I thank you all for your news . words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I am coming back again . &quot;

&quot; it is a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , founded in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , was published in 1971 . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message . &quot;
&quot; all nice and well , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book , instead added an abst@@ in@@ ance of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the pretty short text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the umm@@ au@@ ged City of Th@@ need @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to see her desire to see a real tree . &quot;
&quot; as if that wasn &apos;t suspect enough : the text set by Cameron , partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , begins : &quot; in the silent city of Th@@ need @-@ Vil@@ le , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is there to be a pragm@@ atic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is a bit familiar with the plot of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who had read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row after a child . &quot;
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably from Cameron &apos;s election office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that Camer@@ ons &apos;s text was delivered by Camer@@ ons , but no more immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult . &quot;
&quot; to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the Ka@@ der that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ side victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks are perhaps less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is designed as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; this news : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that critical hits are aligned to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said that - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago one would have leng@@ th@@ ened the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get so good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is a team @-@ man above all . &quot;
the question how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ ward games .
&quot; the only excuse that one can lift was that England was first put Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer whom I elev@@ ate high .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket@@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea , Mo@@ een besides Cook , suggest what an extra Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and get four qui@@ cks , and I don &apos;t have anything against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist can &apos;t beat there , and this le@@ fth@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s not done with his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as op@@ ener .
&quot; he had three hundred races , and did not look back . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that lift their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man of Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
it is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has views from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the spoken word . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys Team@@ colleague at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it . &quot;

&quot; in fact Mili@@ band was more bla@@ iri@@ ans than Blair himself when he opposed Camer@@ ons &apos;s referendum , because Blair had rejected the principle of the un@@ approved Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 giving him a back@@ door . &quot;

&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on Monday in Westminster , I told him that he had no time to spend more time for me - seems in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it can last but it must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position in Europe - I press it very friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blo@@ oming tendency and wild fav@@ ours of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in Radio and TV this week said when the boy@@ sc@@ outs fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns was the appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow @-@ bear@@ er . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleague , without going too far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; stay &quot; under any circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow workers and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on their sentence on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; what &apos;s always the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants - remember that he even touched me - News discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe giving him support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ity for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion under left dis@@ sidents , for which the nar@@ c@@ ision of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic relations . &quot;
&quot; as with its multi @-@ ambig@@ u@@ ity to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C will not start a campaign for exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be committed to try to find a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors at home . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin apply political capital , - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this can be anything meaning@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the United States are already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya , and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government on the power that I was reminded by the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum on Monday . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ sponsored agency that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing public Health UK ( P@@ he ) in their report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Fundam@@ ental Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month handles the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily powerful foundation , &quot; based on his most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J , and asked if the claims &quot; on stone or sand are set up . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liver@@ pool said : &quot; &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public anticip@@ ates that &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi@@ disciplinary decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine content products to a synthesis . the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;

&quot; he also wrote references from BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received by Philip Morris International &apos;s tobacco company , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not supplied , but these include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also include a sector funding in the paper . &quot;

&quot; Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well@@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims were previously re@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence is proof and what is not , especially if there are so much public confusion about relative dangers than tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs two billion euros per year . &quot;
&quot; through clear evidence of current evidence that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;

&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop to send programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square soap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs , which are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC that they will be seen publicly @-@ legal programs , probably from a smaller audience , in hard cont@@ enti@@ ous time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders such as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said he had tried six years in channel 4 without success with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes have been commissioned or broadcast that would be clearly displayed by un@@ conventional ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communic@@ ating Committee on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I think medium or long term does not hold for a good idea , you should at least be at programs that don &apos;t make or commission others . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a maximum possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody would show this is a joke , it is ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed , which could be financed even without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm . &quot;
I am to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would dimin@@ ish the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s fault on the hunt for reviews is &quot; &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart &apos;s lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather publicly @-@ legal niche applications should go to BB@@ C4 , but they fulfil their tasks , and they can argue that if they go to their apparent missions for justi@@ fication of 4 billion Â£ broadcasting fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ liter@@ ate programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; for the broadcasting fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course you think all , we all think that one gets a great value for Â£ 150 per year , but for people who have a lot of money for the 150 Â£ a lot of money , ask me if that is right , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check her Rei@@ ki mission to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain their students . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little by the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should be an example of the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; the question of the partnership said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will be shown , and with commercial sen@@ ders alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;
Son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ odes can change the direction at the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by breaking waves of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes are changing direction at the moment in which they have reson@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses , which have too high frequencies for human ear to be heard . &quot;
&quot; impul@@ ses work by switching Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry out membrane channels , which react to ultrasound waves . &quot;
read more about this topic : reading and writing brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics where ultrasound is used to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the brain stimulation , an inv@@ asive procedure that gives electrical impul@@ ses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; aden@@ wor@@ ms usually do not react on ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani confirmed that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found out , strengthen the ultrasound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves appear on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ms of some of the wor@@ ms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these I@@ onic channels and activate the cells that they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ emat@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels carry . &quot;
&quot; when ultrasound trans@@ forms to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bub@@ bles and transmitted to the wor@@ ms where they turn off the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that needs to be sent down on an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily treat the treated human neur@@ ons temporarily for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in the last quarter , sales rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher cost of packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit reported higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result dropped due to higher labour costs in the cargo business . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; on their most expected conference in the year Federal Reserve Strat@@ ford spent two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ og@@ any table , to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; threatening above them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey seating sa@@ ver is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put forward the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from the Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leader has acknowledged that there is a un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be un@@ reconc@@ iled by the close to zero interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that they are solid , the recent turbul@@ ences on global financial markets are anx@@ ious to intensi@@ fy this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is also just about a quarter of the percentage point . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to do not increase the rate of interest , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus about what the F@@ ed will do is poll@@ uting itself to the financial market .
&quot; about half of econom@@ ists , which have recently been interviewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , have predicted a quar@@ terly increase this week . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets expect to wait for F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the pro@@ position unless the strateg@@ ists reduce the blow by suggest@@ ing that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintained the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , &quot; &quot; they would have to go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t get panic . &quot;
other experts argued that an interest increase would calm the financial markets because it would be the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; another month ago the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow sharpen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the pro@@ position . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid in this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly running under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;

but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of the last month after China had disclosed its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial Average value fell by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would throttle global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered in this month , whereas the Dow is now up to almost 10 % below the ho@@ ch of May . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; when the events in the financial markets and news on the weakness of Chinese economy would not have occurred in the last few weeks , they would appeal to the bre@@ eder , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. bank@@ note bank . &quot;
&quot; now , he prec@@ edes that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the world economy &apos;s health is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere note of Ben S. Bern@@ anke , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow down their monetary expansion &quot; , &quot; triggered confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , the F@@ ed representatives can not only super@@ vise the developments elsewhere , but also advise on other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story of transactions on financial market movements , apparently not linked to economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;

&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its lead by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , despite limited percep@@ tible impact on the growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts revers@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences don &apos;t come close to this plane , he said . &quot;
&quot; you certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation where they are afraid of interest in interest , because the markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act always contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think they should rush ahead of time . &quot;

Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation Spr@@ S tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good nutrition during bre@@ ast@@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by approximately 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment to make mothers better . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;

&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the bridge festival association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able - organized by the union of W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen , Germany . &quot;
Viktor Or@@ b@@ Ã¡n reports further tens of thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of an apparent policy :
&quot; instead of the R@@ Ã¶s@@ z@@ ke camp in order to help build structures to ensure Human@@ eness , our Federal Chancellor has officially opened up the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ circle of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; this policy is not only the Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions now in the border regions . &quot;
&quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; blessed land &quot; &quot; has been invited and welcomed , is nothing more than another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will become a major challenge in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , in order to establish decent conditions for protective seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;

Sam Wood holds his lips tightly to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have evolved in a ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; could their answers become the gam@@ bler who won the heart of the Bachel@@ ors . &quot;

Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and noticed Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that they were quite compatible , and I thought it was the whole course of the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the earth with both feet on the ground , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; Mark@@ o added . &quot;
&quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the House visit last week her clear that Wood would be &quot; &quot; one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this was obviously not just a game - I am now subject to him , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked , whom Wood was to choose if not she was , she was pu@@ zzling . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .

but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .

Tom@@ s@@ ula continued his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ swear Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by speci@@ alt@@ e@@ ams Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his nau@@ gh@@ ty catch and to take care of the next game .
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ rolled in a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian bon@@ dage for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field after F@@ um@@ ble , and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career . &quot;
&quot; this was a thing that is now common , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; in 2007 , Hay@@ ne was able to act as a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land . &quot;

four people killed when polic@@ emen killed in Nepal shooting demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police were killed in a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a public official said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , leading district official said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and burned bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said , the police used tear gas and fired them into the air before they came back to rubber floors . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber floors are known to kill them , but they are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last few weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ adhes@@ i say that new provinces , which would be formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ ose who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally regulated for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature proposed this week on certain cl@@ auses in the Constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials stated that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;

&quot; for an easy over@@ weight diabetes , weight loss surgery may be helpful . &quot;
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether light over@@ weight people live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , which wrote a gui@@ deline for the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , Adi@@ posit@@ as surgery has proven to be an efficient treatment for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out for people who are physically ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with BM@@ I above 30 are regarded as ob@@ ese . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers used from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes for people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I under those who under@@ went this operation declined from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; however , BM@@ I remained in those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who under@@ went a surgical procedure , 36 % of the type of diabetes dissolved , and at 28 % partially . &quot;

&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is the best among 7 percent , writing the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by approximately 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - not decreased mort@@ ality in five years , so the researchers said Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also adju@@ sts average results in two types of surgery .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show a survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was subjected to ob@@ ese people suffering from obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group using conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study has no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was comfor@@ ting for persons with BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this low BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I , between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we are waiting for too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as they have accumulated these genetic modifications that have associated their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;

it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dal@@ ai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot take all the refugees , said the Dal@@ ai Lama , and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leader asked to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , devoted to ethics studies . &quot;
he called for that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not adequate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama in Germany and Austria praised his efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as true peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we have to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke to the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the US drag@@ ged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;
4 times increase in consumption of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
&quot; in the US , tox@@ ins control centres in the US report about a nearly 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , who swal@@ low heavily alcoholic hand des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of inf@@ ec@@ tious inf@@ ec@@ tious agents in children under 12 were reported to report the poison control centres , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children always come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants pur@@ pos@@ efully drinking while some people do to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berries , grapes and orange du@@ cks which are very appealing for children . &quot;
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially for small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ ers can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the toxic emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around but people leave these hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah sh@@ ou@@ ted her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had kno@@ cked her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s mother , CNN . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; over alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with fat@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained toxic , non @-@ declared ingredients . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities suggest that the product contained meth@@ anol , a fatal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol which was recorded as an active agent . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in New York planned to poison their &quot; gem@@ a &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , so there was a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ish them out of their room .

&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they don &apos;t show the highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here speak not just about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old Firm Games and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .

&quot; after the defeat against Mal@@ m@@ Ã¶ and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat of 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen was headed ahead of the top of the table with five points . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel this exactly - but we need to go on .
&quot; we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the player better . &quot;

why I will be a witness of an error in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except in a late @-@ legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sp@@ atter . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses during his death .
&quot; the invitation was for the first time in January of his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew near@@ er , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agree , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications than places available , a ma@@ wi@@ mmer lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected . &quot;

I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps &apos;s closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we laugh often much when we talk .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compla@@ ined about her .
&quot; they said they &quot; &quot; could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; , &quot; but they still think that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to be present in order to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter for Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary act .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can apply for this .
what you will receive from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables in last year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she passed a personal campaign against him with late sc@@ rat@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media he always tried to do what is best for racing , and he has found himself under difficult conditions when it went to the positive cob@@ alt ink sample with Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had held 18 months because of es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations , and didn &apos;t want it to see it as too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have a long time to eat , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to move up@@ lifted head , and I want my owners think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity Department had tried to spy on his stable . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will be asked if I will be asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy at rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they apparently believe that I am a dec@@ ei@@ ver .
&quot; if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they have failed to grasp me . &quot;

&quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will exercise pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the Fru@@ str@@ ations levels of the Train@@ ers have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the late sc@@ rat@@ ching led to that he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ la@@ yed Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the rac@@ le treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horses debate . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing sports . &quot;
&quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff was ab@@ rup@@ ting mud on the leg . &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .

it is a joke .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; of two Premier League favorites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring games &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hard @-@ pac@@ ed note to the Storm Team , after his team had reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; by Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land did not &quot; too well &quot; in the rings . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ p of his team and said that they were concentrated on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; during the Tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team were confident and confident that they were worried about being defeated by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring events when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles to a real focus , and that has provided us the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s already strange , as this occurs again at this time of the year . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and his ment@@ or reminded that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he would take care of a shit . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of soccer - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they can play . &quot;
I build greater confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against Roo@@ sters achieved a higher score than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is it an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and do not score a bit of a bit of tension ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase . &quot;
the Storm team has released this weekend since they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I park . the ticket sales begin on the next Tuesday morning .

&quot; a man who might suffer a lifel@@ ong sentence due to his attempt to get into possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which was s@@ mug@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested for the last month after the Federal Police took 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America over Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the J@@ ach@@ harbour during the morning and later at CafÃ© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially lifel@@ ong sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that there could have been a harm@@ less reason in the cafÃ© . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police over his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs Mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 for security together to reach his release . &quot;
&quot; according to the reading of the impressive declarations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be sufficient to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against damage , under conditions that he sent his Australian and Serbian passport to the police every day and stops at an initial stop from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

&quot; the police took care about and saw the five images , analyzed then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related web research , &quot; the terms used for searching for un@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed that he did it because it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile in the Internet , &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ ached to be a polic@@ eman in order to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;

&quot; he admitted that searching on the computer was done by him , however , it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he would then see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;

every two years the car manufacturers show their innovations at the IAA .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; at present , cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations fell by the Federal Aviation Authority ( KBA ) on this segment alone in August . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence Days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept vehicles and luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand at the dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; as a result , the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra should not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen also offer other diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only a fifth @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Combi , which can also be seen at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Astra at the IAA , what will still be up to new compact cars in addition to the Astra ? &quot;

Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; with the new model , the Nissan @-@ install@@ ers will find its position in the rapidly growing segment . &quot;
the compact Infin@@ iti offers its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , among them a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is based on the manufacturer &apos;s instructions at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not entirely new but completely new is the DS 4 compact class model that can be seen at the IAA .
&quot; from the outside , the designers of the precious Citro@@ Ã«@@ n @-@ Ex@@ leg@@ ers were in front of the front part : here the radiator gr@@ ille was newly drawn and the head@@ lights with LED technology were fitted . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was modernis@@ ed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated Apple @-@ Play for the first time . &quot;

&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we do this &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany after the German Federal Ministry of Interior Affairs this year , according to the statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated decis@@ i@@ vely in the face of the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can create this and we can create it .
&quot; what comes to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; according to various progn@@ oses between 35@@ 0,000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - namely the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it is built up until now ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects : 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments come out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly inexpensive apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot;

&quot; however , to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes manus@@ cri@@ pts in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if required by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the capacity of training - for example by allowing more professional schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students will be prepared for classes without knowledge of German language skills . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ atic from Berlin School administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk believes that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .

&quot; in future , Islam will play an important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should embrace Islam gradually the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches have right to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is important that the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , which is professional for newcom@@ ers to the new arri@@ vals . &quot;
the rights also belong to the rights .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam have to agree on clear persons and be willing to collaborate with the state in many areas and to grant them certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to host against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the President of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; for those who wanted such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately their right to stay in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bavarian Radio . &quot;
he suggested to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change the disman@@ tling of discrimination and racism . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since a scar@@ ce decade , an anti @-@ discrimination authority and a general equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U mur@@ ders showed , in the police and authorities , the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored . &quot;
&quot; the same opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interests of non @-@ white German have long been calling for a long time and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism ban on Germany have to be realised in the next few years , when the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical assistance to previously expected refugees . &quot;
&quot; as far as Man@@ - Power and capacities are concerned , we create this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;

FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb must stand behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; in contrast to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , he stressed that it was only September and if his rehabilitation went on plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of his story , his participation in the next summer on the European Championship is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the big shame in this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to its old momentum during the season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in connection with his knu@@ ck@@ les , or with the injuries he had before . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from purely medical perspective , but as well recognized , there is the associated danger of further violations , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has 23 different illnesses from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut of six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ pi@@ es in the last five times .
the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight times since 2007 / 08 .

&quot; sometimes when you come from a breach , you have a vulner@@ ability period , a time in which you strengthen your body and win fighting strength , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will run a career out of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al will start his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and W@@ enger introduces a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; HÃ©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ Ã­n and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
W@@ enger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep balance and give the players that need to treat a little break break , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; although arsen@@ al clear favorites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the largest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defe@@ ating after 41 matches , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , whereby the judge &apos;s scale was 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al pulled the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains from far @-@ sigh@@ ted hope , with his management to lead the society to his first European triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;

&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open , now dou@@ bt@@ less than ever since , as suicide rates among young men have demonstrated on a 15 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death among men in the age of 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and there will be three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in effort to tackle the problem , announced the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim to question the culture in question that men are trying to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that when the body had enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally wholes@@ ome friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of social media , communication , with its focus on style , is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has the need to appear strong , lifel@@ i@@ rous and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psychologists say ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner year@@ ning for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can &apos;t buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty at the friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality defined by the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Joey and Chand@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when watching football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to each case even though they are often reluct@@ ant to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of the phone pastoral care explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; my listen@@ ers for people who feel depres@@ sive and mur@@ mu@@ red , really showed me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us are often unable to speak with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I &apos;m dealing with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect on how the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot;

&quot; so very , my objective out@@ si@@ der status over the phone may also help people in the moments of desp@@ air , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend comedy Central European Friend@@ s@@ Fest with celebration of the day completely re@@ designed backdrop , why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; maybe even better if you &apos;re sitting around in Star@@ bucks someone alone , give him a smile and say Hello . &quot;

&quot; with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish masters , since they are not only aiming for the qualification for the K.@@ O. l@@ aps , but an improvement on the way to the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class@@ y of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs . he was later in the game against his hom@@ et@@ own team and against the club , with whom he started his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore it is a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things we need to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his own place against Bor@@ deaux in the first league , but he was exposed in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an g@@ ull was referred to as the man who was able to take the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis &apos;s Pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ Ã¶ @-@ Defence , he went over nicely into the long corner of the grid . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; at An@@ pi@@ ff , Mal@@ m@@ Ã¶ sm@@ iled in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , with nine national players in the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle @-@ field . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed by Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s post in the 3@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave up , with some patches and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was in the first half of the first half and then abandoned after the launch of Cav@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; however , he showed much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which Di Maria turned into a shot , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ... &quot;
&quot; the second goal finally fell short after the hours stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ yer scored his sixth season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had caught a left flank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; it ended up all the thought that Mal@@ m@@ Ã¶ could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before the waiting list of Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi had been recognised by the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Mal@@ m@@ Ã¶ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later became that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champ@@ ions league game was in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then we have only played in the Swedish League , who did not have the same level . &quot;

matt Dam@@ on is playing diversity in the film
&quot; matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said , they are not needed behind the scenes . &quot;
&quot; during a succession of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown broke out when the need for alternative perspectives was emphas@@ ised and in terms of a black prot@@ agon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown was shocked , with ins@@ ult@@ ed dis@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian insi@@ sted . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the character of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a Nut@@ te , which is beaten by her white fe@@ ather . &quot;
&quot; dear readers , as these audi@@ ob@@ ooks are in German , it simply does not make sense to translate them into any other language . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media exploded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;

Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the peak of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman , the movement Black Li@@ ves Matter achieved nationwide action and urged leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors and authorities to stop discrimination practices against far@@ ce living . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a recording to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; album still matter , &quot; ( albums always have their meaning ) . &quot;
&quot; as books and black life , albums always have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Matter have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as an hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the Black Li@@ ves Matter network is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;

&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crow@@ ned first Champion
Pro sport clim@@ ber and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first Ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prize of $ 1 million with home .
&quot; the competition show , which concluded their 7th season , had never experienced an competition participant who could close all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Camer@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing at a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time , with which he was the first Ath@@ l@@ ete who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster than the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero talked with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prize of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than 10,000 $ or to life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer Kent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter , to discuss the fin@@ als and why Brit@@ ten , even though he was first at all , won &apos;t get any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , he gets the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he swe@@ ars any gro@@ ll over it .
he is just so happy to have what he has done .
masses of awards received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m happy that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac felt as just as if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior has been extended for an A@@ ged season and the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers over Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins over
the second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; in the past , they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
the Tw@@ ins turned a chance for Ascen@@ sion within a half of the Houston astro@@ s for the second American League wild@@ card .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; all vic@@ tories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Per@@ m . &quot;
Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive supporting when Detroit took three times in the first two inn@@ ings then once in the sixth and then again in the n@@ inth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) beat 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start into his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen of every game , and so I want to go into the game completely . &quot;
&quot; the designer Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle &apos;s Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has well dra@@ ined the sle@@ d@@ geh@@ ammer , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , saw clearly better out of the bul@@ l@@ pen and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three races in the rear at the end of the seventh day , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back into the game . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks got a Mul@@ liner and Simon put his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to a stri@@ ke@@ out before he replaced Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy by le@@ fth@@ anded Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy passed down wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who was the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finale @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen launched the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe for a double play . &quot;
&quot; it was that in the Major League for the 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe was beating a double play &quot;
&quot; after Detroit at the end of the n@@ inth inn@@ ings added a Insurance @-@ Run , Wall managed a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;

Detroit benefited from the start of the game by another no moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three rein@@ forc@@ ements in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been cancelled before the game of the injury list after having missed more than one month because of a sp@@ inal paraly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started getting rid of and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch as in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after having received Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first place , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game , which made a single &quot; up the Middle &quot; for the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in scoring position .
&quot; the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ ano followed by a single on the right side , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended . &quot;

&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; said Tw@@ ins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not hit particularly well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in third inning before he replaced A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter &apos;s reli@@ ever . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came three races with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .

&quot; after F@@ Ã¶hn@@ gen on Thursday morning we crossed a marked cold front , which brings strong rain falls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline . &quot;

&quot; there is rain , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in sum , south of the Alps must be counted in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , this after the last few days have fallen into large amounts of rain . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the F@@ Ã¶h@@ n enters the air , as a result rolls a cold front with a strong , partly swe@@ aty rain from West to East via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front the wind winds up strongly to stor@@ my , and temperatures are clearly back . &quot;

Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare H@@ ogan Lov@@ ells
&quot; in the presence of the President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino has been bapti@@ sed to the name of the German Re@@ formed Church on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; , &quot; he is now considered &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of Protest@@ ant Churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded the fact that Protest@@ ants were often only able to live in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority . &quot;
the place will be visible in symbo@@ lic@@ ally that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian conv@@ ent around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he felt the city then as a welcome sin b@@ abel .
his negative impressions will probably be strengthened by historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the spl@@ itting of the Western Church with his thes@@ es .
hammer artist invested three years into personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown is one of the principal works , the Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Testament , which is now published with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretation of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old , but it is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; for three years , Ot@@ mar has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subjects of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are cycles , which are dedicated to topics such as cross @-@ way , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds , or fa@@ ther@@ land . &quot;
&quot; he spont@@ ane@@ ously fascin@@ ated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological focus , as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the basis of painting with the particular bi@@ blical places . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible texts selected by Ot@@ mar , and thus translated into current connections . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ ati@@ m mirrors of Al@@ ts Painting .
they are embedded between the original text of Martin Luther and one set of the artist who formulated his very personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; this enables the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; in the end , emotions were the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter orders . &quot;
&quot; since the education was already done with the cane , Ot@@ mar is reminis@@ cent of Ot@@ mar . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work that , in order to bring me back again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to revi@@ ve art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed era : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is marked by rec@@ l@@ ame today , and that is loud . &quot;
the symboli@@ sm is being pushed .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer go into the images , let them discover and feel the strength they have : &quot; &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not care to capture the Bible completely , but carefully chosen for him , including mysterious themes . &quot;
&quot; this was no co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; it was created by a picture Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ Ã¶h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ Ã¶h@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas wall@@ papers - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15th at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
