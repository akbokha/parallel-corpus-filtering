Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as T@@ ehr@@ an dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , there is also a conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been tense for years .
&quot; Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement construction of Israel , and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process . &quot;
by the deal of the Obama designated deal to the Iranian nuclear program the relationship between the two continues to deteri@@ orate .
&quot; in March Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the U.S. Congress , which was part of Obama &apos;s affairs . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , but a meeting was rejected with regard to the election of the election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , his friend is shot dead &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officials found the bodies of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was attached to a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to und@@ o , I loved Amy and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb who had travelled to the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , already had 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ ti@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb has made the fatal emergency call at some point later .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : lamb took life as the police possessed it . &quot;
&quot; one day after shooting at the university , students and instruc@@ tors forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; from the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , details , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were fre@@ ed up for his lessons .
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations on problematic behavi@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb praised , he also seemed a bit excited and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he had told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Delta State University asked the Delta State University to provide evidence for health reasons and said that he had any health problem . &quot;
&quot; this year , he only taught two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy mean that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to a position as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University president William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
do you have any questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer .
&quot; after fle@@ eing from the campus , police subsequently found the Lam@@ bs track when he went back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car ran in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , he started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he had a doctor@@ ate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met together with friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing . &quot;
he was the Women &apos;s Black Forest at the time .
&quot; all girls mel@@ ted there , when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss obviously had some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house that borders on a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the former husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was completely destroyed at the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; he met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail , three years ago , met both on a summer @-@ year market . &quot;
later they played together one or another gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter , and sings her own music . &quot;

&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a Bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes Entertainment Co@@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic game ended before a festive audience . &quot;
there was no sign of anything that anything did not vote .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were in the clearing and sh@@ attered together .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense for sh@@ ear . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the tot@@ e professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American n@@ atives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitch@@ ell , a English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his brother and the student committee .
&quot; on the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and took about 900 people , including teachers , staff , students , and members of the municipality at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial service . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the ahn@@ awake , while the university &apos;s &quot; &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be recorded on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to return our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .

&quot; Associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now said that Lamb was shot after he shot himself , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss himself described as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever been married . &quot;

Michael J. Fox singing on his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable also for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an imp@@ ending documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simulated g@@ äh@@ ner and a length of it , with the Princess of Wales at a date . &quot;

Poroshenko to speak at UN General Assembly meeting dedicated to large movements of refugees
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says , its response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will cause violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief asks again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integral negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the General Assembly meeting to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he lam@@ ented that the divisions in the Council and the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria that they have demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
some have tried to brand him as flo@@ p .
others have done him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how few Rep@@ ublic@@ ans attempt to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys conducted Donald Tr@@ ump in the two @-@ digit area , and some begin to seriously consider what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the Real Estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump probably won Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts stress that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was given leadership to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , of whom none of them had won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
&quot; but outside @-@ zone groups like J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economy group Club for Growth have now now recogni@@ zing Tr@@ um@@ ps through staying power and start to run their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him . &quot;
here are some current survey values that indicate that the Real Estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Any concei@@ vable values turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University , that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
&quot; for example , three of ten people say they have a negative opinion . &quot;
and these figures remain in the early states .
a qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good view of Tr@@ ump .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in a survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next thing to do with enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 per cent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters , that they were &quot; &quot; un@@ happy &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Establi@@ sh@@ ments , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters voted for the Republi@@ can candidates that the Mog@@ ul has the right tem@@ per for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post will be on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first pre @-@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality of a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent believe that he did not have the personality to be effective and almost six of 10 Independent MPs say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the idea .
&quot; when they apply their mit@@ es , Republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who will win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a poll of CNN / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July their money came to J@@ eb Bush .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; at that time in the final cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought Rick Perry earned the nom@@ ination for only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump becomes almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the broken field probably contributes to tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed over a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head @-@ at @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is re@@ aping the majority support . &quot;
&quot; before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ ges and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypothetical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new poll conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that there is only a little more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump , say they have given their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never to change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; however , Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since then , Donald Tr@@ ump called &quot; &quot; rapi@@ sts &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , was the immigration of shooting and fishing in public discourse . &quot;
&quot; some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expressions of Tr@@ ump will hold crucial His@@ p@@ ano Americans from the Republi@@ can party , and damage the re@@ orientation efforts . &quot;
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; as long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump apparently will also do it . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s up to new heights .
&quot; on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , around half of Republi@@ can voters support Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also fur@@ ious in Washington .
&quot; a poll conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa in front of two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Prime Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;

&quot; a lucky hit by Thomas Müller made the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ re@@ aus , then ran it . &quot;
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern in the witch chair of Pi@@ re@@ aus a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ win in the Champions League for the Greek record master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to g@@ arb@@ age double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Göt@@ zes hits ( 8@@ 9. ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth start of the series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot;
&quot; Müller received his 28th hit in the Champions League to Bavaria @-@ guidance of the Olympic Games Tor@@ wart Roberto , who caused a commemor@@ ative shot of the world champion as a flan@@ ks . &quot;

&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; but the Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , with their aggressive endeav@@ ors but often too imagin@@ ative to work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often carried out by playing wareh@@ ouses on left @-@ hand side Douglas Costa , which rarely passed through the former Braunschweig O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ del@@ la@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Müller had more luck from the right side , when his flank was hit from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ que . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion gave the potential 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown suggested the pole of the poles from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct use , the Tor@@ wart Roberto was par@@ ked with the knee ( 35@@ . ) . &quot;

&quot; after a few minutes later , Go@@ ze came out for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by I@@ meter Müller still sat on it . &quot;

the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to clarify the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; said the responsible EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Mal@@ m@@ ström . &quot;
the Swe@@ de decided to introduce the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the United States .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by the TTIP , the biggest free trade zone of the world is to develop over 800 million people . &quot;
the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings clearly see that the EU states and the U.S. can co @-@ operate independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the USA and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned . &quot;
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ g@@ ments .

&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critic@@ ised as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , through the company &apos;s claim for compensation to the tax@@ pa@@ yers , to en@@ force national laws or en@@ force a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first opinions , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act urged the Commission &apos;s proposals as insufficient . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ut at the Prime Minister &apos; Fra@@ gran@@ ces
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has been waiting for his election since his election at the Prime Minister &apos; Fra@@ gran@@ ce
the new Labour chair@@ person Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos; Fra@@ gran@@ ce and put himself for the first time with David Cameron for the first time .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six proposed questions shortly after lunch , with his performance by the media prob@@ able and the Labour ME@@ Ps are examined . &quot;
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the cabinet secretary and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them at a commem@@ oration ceremony to the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ises criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the centre of several Tit@@ els@@ berg stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; ir@@ respective of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they are called on differences in the economy , defense and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliam@@ ent@@ arian party was originally supported as leaders . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are st@@ acked within the labour &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; and to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statement on the position of the European Union and the limitation . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes take place in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; Mr Smith , the shadow of work and minister minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory leader in the last decade , over the Dis@@ patch @-@ Box in parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader who has promised another policy approach , says he has &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions of Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Isl@@ ington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ nai@@ res is too con@@ front@@ ative , and that it is both &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ fe with an ad@@ versary , and instead made it possible to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Council minister , will be represented if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is on the road . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the under@@ storey , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kasper@@ l theatre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on TV in 1990 , the question@@ nai@@ res were considered as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ents , although critics argue that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gi@@ os and deserves the opinion of the President of the Australian tennis board Steve He@@ aly more praise than criticism for his own behavior . &quot;
&quot; the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; was accompanied by the not@@ orious confron@@ tation of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying session in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbitr@@ ators , and Har@@ rison had to beat Bulgaria , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp@@ f held a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I was rather en@@ vious , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute , He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cr@@ amp@@ age in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat of fru@@ stration with itself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he &apos;s extremely well beha@@ ved in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around and I think he was a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very rei@@ fer 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os during the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the contro@@ versy around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he climb@@ s into the eyes of the public and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to support him , but we try to give him the consequences of his action . &quot;

&quot; Hungary explains the state of emergency and rati@@ fied the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all those who tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos is followed at the border , as hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indig@@ nation . &quot;
the people who fled from violence were arrested for an unknown time in a country strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; as a police helicopter over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; and sm@@ ells ins@@ ults against the Hungarian deploy@@ ments police . &quot;
some rejected food and water protests .
&quot; Minister of Foreign Affairs said it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not be a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ences on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border arrived a day after the 28 Nations blo@@ c in Brussels not to reconc@@ ile a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who sought refuge in excess of Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be achieved that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; in Hungary , however , Hungary replaced its hopes on a Baltic action from Brussels or from its neighb@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , there were more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and accelerate asylum proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a barb@@ ed wire along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants across the country - after it has finished a fence on the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons were deployed in the race , barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in the past few months , Hungary has become a major shortage of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who claim to protect - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , among them Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which entered into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 metre ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher sti@@ cking punishment for convic@@ ted human traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es state of emergency , &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters of Associated Press have already seen in the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Landes @-@ Security Advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities found 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others have already entered the country . &quot;
&quot; they come up by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of being accused of off@@ ences following the new laws . &quot;
authorities are to repair the fence .
&quot; Hungarian officials concluded on Tuesday morning , two of the seven border cros@@ sings with Serbia after a train wagon with barb@@ ed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos ren@@ ders the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to get there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands of them remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would have food and water to travel to Hungary .

&quot; the former U.S. Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race to nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite to the ground . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is a presidential candidate , receives support from 15 per cent of the democratic voters in the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Cl@@ int@@ ons supporters are more than one of the other candidates in their choice .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton lost a number of demo@@ graphics groups while S@@ anders scored a few wins . &quot;

&quot; Cl@@ int@@ ons &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has van@@ ished , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton has a big advantage in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters voted nationwide that they would support Clinton , if they were nominated by the party . &quot;
&quot; a quarter would support them with some precau@@ tions and another 15 percent would only support them , because they are the candidate . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; maybe not surprising that Cl@@ int@@ ons are passionate supporters , especially of her . &quot;

&quot; in addition , quot@@ ing of your company at the Spon@@ sors board of the conference &quot;
&quot; as the Vice @-@ President th@@ rows a potential for the presi@@ dency office into the scales , 57 per cent of the democratic voters will see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters choose the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
Cl@@ int@@ ons &apos;s supporters say more than half that bi@@ den would be their second choice far before S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to can@@ dic@@ ate the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage above S@@ anders will increase from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important in one candidate , Democratic elect@@ ors call the vot@@ er question . &quot;
&quot; similarly , in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters choose the elections as un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some key features in some of the choices of their party .
&quot; they consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; for the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts the best of hon@@ esty while Cl@@ int@@ ons &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;

&quot; democratic voters in the elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions about H@@ illary cl@@ int@@ ons , using a personal email address and a server during the period of office as an Foreign Minister , most Democ@@ rat voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions are not affected altogether . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
&quot; half of Americans are un@@ happy with their explanation , while only one @-@ third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no impact on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said they still deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they are mostly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;

five members of Brotherhood &apos;s death bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Neul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student during a ra@@ iny ritual when a student engagement in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , Mord@@ ank@@ ees were filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood seized Ch@@ un &quot; &quot; Michael &quot; &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport into the hospital , which contributed to his death , distributed the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he was charged with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to turn over a frozen field to a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ ache , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood do not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ full and allegedly waiting for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to switch to D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ fy his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g , the national President of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members , tools to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in general about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ ti@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ve , and he died next morning at his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , den@@ g repeated with bl@@ unt strength injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the Sch@@ ik@@ anen since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indict@@ ment for the murder of the third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
&quot; thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with criminal attacks and education of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has officially been sanc@@ tioned - officially or in@@ officially - this will also be added to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; interest income comes , and the house will get into the banks , returns for bonds , and the economy will gli@@ de into recession . &quot;
we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance on the process . &quot;
a recession occurred within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments are responding . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank stressed that investors should not concentrate when it starts to increase interest rates but rather on the period which is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could notice that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a interest increase . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interests to normal heights , but still at a low level , in order to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effects . &quot;
here is a view on historical trends which could react to some areas of the economy :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticipated withdrawal of interest rate things can be volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to dic@@ ate income from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may perhaps reflected the delay in monetary policy , said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle , and the return on return will begin to decrease . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the present case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that it did not exist before and which could ha@@ sten a recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest rate in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and throw the question on whether this time is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants spent all year on an interest in the F@@ ed year , and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee that ended on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all enhancement cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in the construction of GDP and before the start of recovery in the shadow , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been a total of 74 months . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares if they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the returns appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle takes place . &quot;
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer Firm of the Year for Insolven@@ cy Administration Schneider Gei@@ witz &amp; Partner Firm of the Year for Tax Glei@@ ss Lutz
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schwa@@ b believe that the increase in the interest rates will lead to closer cooperation between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a fl@@ att@@ ening of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high interest rates often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fixed @-@ Income analy@@ st at Schwa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
Jones believes that markets have already adapted themselves to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; interest rates have increased , the income curve is fl@@ atter , credit spreads have expanded and the volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed increased its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and the whole , businesses will benefit the greater part of their business activity in the US , where interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debt will become worse , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market , and the financing of its debts . &quot;
&quot; the history shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively after an initial interest increase , Gold@@ man Sach@@ s said in a report for the customers . &quot;

an Arab version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .

time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note bank
&quot; the world is ob@@ serving when the U.S. central bank@@ note coinci@@ des on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision whether for the first time for nearly a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , which were sur@@ vey@@ ed by Reuters , found that a little more than half the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it is seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest continued to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , chief personnel at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance level , tr@@ illion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less harsh outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the indications suggest that the chances for such a step are good . &quot;
the decision shall be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday .

&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi am Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues on the day , he wrote a note to say that it was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; with the first murder , and he wanted to make it &quot; &quot; tired &quot; &quot; by authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , instructor for geography and social scientific education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said he had shot down on a man , and killed someone . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; What is the difference between the United States and the United States ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

Lamb was no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as a police scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could und@@ o it . &quot;
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who loved me ever .
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb went to Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; University president William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb claimed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brings the left outer defense to we@@ eping and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack of Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was built into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very hard and then fantastic plays , and then this happens . &quot;
&quot; in the locker room , he had an oxygen mask . &quot;
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I don &apos;t have a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then the six months , and he will not play in the group stage . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .

&quot; he is very difficult because it &apos;s not his intention to hurt your opponent , and if you hear it is a very bad violation , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was traveling in another direction , so that it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;

&quot; it is a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost . &quot;
it is because you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , who was released in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , was published in 1971 . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message . &quot;
&quot; all nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron is suppos@@ edly describes the plot of the book , instead added an abst@@ in@@ ance of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the pretty brief original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the umm@@ au@@ ged City of Th@@ need @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to see her desire to see a true tree . &quot;
&quot; as if it would not be susp@@ icious enough : the text written by Cameron , partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , begins : &quot; in the silent city of Th@@ need @-@ Vil@@ le , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he gives a pragm@@ atic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is a bit familiar with the plot of the book . here a un@@ named boy , like the local environment , sounds like the local environment , despite the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , sn@@ ur@@ ring creature that speaks in the name of the trees , is devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read the Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row . &quot;
&quot; a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said , that the text was probably from Cameron &apos;s election office . &quot;
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that Camer@@ ons &apos;s text was delivered by Camer@@ ons , but there were no more immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it &apos;s still hard &quot;
&quot; to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the Ka@@ der that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward penalty .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks are perhaps less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;

&quot; in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are aligned to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to nom@@ ination , da - and I said that - players have their own best choices . &quot;
&quot; long ago one could have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny . &quot;

&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he did not bring such good achievements , and that surprised me not ; he is a team @-@ man above all . &quot;
the question how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th won seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and reverse play .
&quot; the only excuse that one can lift was that England was first put Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer whom I play high .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket@@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he scored 236 against us on a tr@@ ent bridge . &quot;
&quot; he must at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of making mos@@ ques next to Cook can cause an extra Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and get four qui@@ cks , and I don &apos;t have anything against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist can &apos;t beat there , and this le@@ fth@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; but he is not doing his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
&quot; he had three hundred races , and did not look back . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited way of dealing with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that lift their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man of Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
he is one of the nic@@ est guy of the game that will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has views from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the spoken word . &quot;

&quot; David Cameron &apos;s imm@@ ol@@ ated re @-@ action strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , who was severely dis@@ rupted due to Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at delighted that some member states are deeply involved in various crises , such as the EU , and not always from their guilt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ imposed agenda with split conc@@ essions and dis@@ rup@@ tive changes that they do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided upon its annual meeting that it may not be endanger@@ ed if they end@@ anger the social protection . &quot;
we could also name Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of itself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , coming home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always around me .
&quot; my European friend who is looking for a looking UK inside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials in some capit@@ als have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany carefully under@@ lined Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but it has been in power for 10 years , and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for it as it looks bad for it as it looks bad for the exagger@@ ated long out@@ si@@ ding such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ending force .
&quot; Poland soon became a nation@@ alist right government , Spain one left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will be able to tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be used to prevent the British withdrawal from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most of them have similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even inten@@ tionally ab@@ stain from useful ann@@ ot@@ ations , particularly in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the new tre@@ ati@@ se was a &quot; &quot; P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the new tre@@ ati@@ se . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how to burn the Fle@@ et Street on their costs and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press seb@@ ac@@ one , as it was supported by Tony Ben@@ n , who supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ unists who have made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Straight Ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 years . &quot;
&quot; with all his reluct@@ ance Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sho@@ ot@@ ings , telephone hack@@ tivi@@ sts and the p@@ seudo @-@ non @-@ countries that have most of our big newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Blair was similar to her , but confirmed that when one sits down with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one is better distributed ban@@ anas to dist@@ ract him instead of being served for lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ ans than Blair himself when he opposed Camer@@ ons &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums , because Blair had rejected the principle of the un@@ approved Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot;

&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on Monday in Westminster , I told him that he doesn &apos;t need any time anymore for me - seems in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take , but it must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position to Europe is - I press it very friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blo@@ oming tendency and wild fav@@ ours of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism may say yes . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on Radio and Television this week said when the boy@@ sc@@ outs fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father was trying to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleague , without going too far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; &quot; under any circumstances &quot; &quot; Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow workers and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on their sentence on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; what &apos;s always the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even touched me - News discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a bro@@ od @-@ site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe giving him support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ity for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ett Siege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of the es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sidents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its multi @-@ ambig@@ u@@ ity for Nato , Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C will not start a campaign for exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be committed to try to find a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin apply political capital - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when it can be point@@ less ?
&quot; the United States are already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government on power , as I was reminded by the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum on Monday . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined by critici@@ zing public health England ( P@@ he ) in their report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; Fundam@@ ental Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month handles the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily simple foundation , &quot; based on the P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J , and asked if the claims are based on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liver@@ pool said : &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public anticip@@ ates that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi @-@ subject decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis . the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;

&quot; he also wrote references from BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ette manufacturer , but not the financing he intended to obtain from tobacco companies Philip Morris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not supplied , but there are several known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also include a sector funding in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco line was attended by P@@ he . &quot;

&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said he was previously re@@ acted to the claims of BM@@ J . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence is proof and what is not , especially if there are so much public confusion about relative dangers than tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs two billion euros per year . &quot;
&quot; through the clear evidence of current evidence that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;

&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square soap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are likely to be seen from a smaller audience , in hard cont@@ enti@@ ous time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said he had tried six years in channel 4 without success with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes have been commissioned or broadcast that would be clearly shown by un@@ conventional ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communic@@ ating Committee on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to hold the broadcast fee , what I think medium or long @-@ term should not be a good idea , you should at least be at programs that others don &apos;t do or give them a job . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a maximum possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed , which could be financed even without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly , both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm to do this . &quot;
I am to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would dimin@@ ish the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s fault on the hunt for reviews is &quot; &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC announce that what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart &apos;s lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather publicly @-@ legal niche programmes should go to BB@@ C4 , but they are fulfilling their tasks , and they can argue when they go on their apparent missions to justify the justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ radio fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ servers that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; for the broadcasting fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather frequent system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from it . &quot;
&quot; of course , you think all , we all think that one gets a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who have a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if that is right , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check her Rei@@ ki mission to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain their Rei@@ ki mission . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little by BBC &apos;s production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and they should take an example in the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; the question of the partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will be shown , and with the commercial sen@@ ders alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ odes can change the direction at the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by breaking waves of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes are changing direction at the moment in which they have reson@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses , which have high frequencies for human ear to be heard . &quot;
the impul@@ ses work by switching Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry out membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ genetic , where ultrasound is used to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the brain stimulation , an inv@@ asive procedure that gives electrical impul@@ ses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread @-@ wor@@ ms usually do not react on ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani confirmed that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found it out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ms of some of the saus@@ age cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these I@@ onic channels and activate the cells that they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ emat@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels carry . &quot;
&quot; when using ultrasound on the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ phones and transmitted to the wor@@ ms where the mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons are switched on . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that needs to be sent down on an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass freely and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily treat the infected human neur@@ ons temporarily for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; after eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in the belief of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense sm@@ iles of those who have anno@@ yed me - and to the numerous , long @-@ standing complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have lear@@ nt can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to tie up : people tell where you come from where you come from , and where you have taken sab@@ bath year , where you are standing with regards to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are saying &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite not hate nor hate , because in the seri@@ ousness , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract H@@ AH@@ AH@@ A , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;

&quot; the chances are good that they say to themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;

it facilitates integration .
&quot; this is different , if man under@@ takes people in residential blocks . &quot;
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers each . &quot;
&quot; each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees say it is peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the specific needs .
how high are the costs ?

only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers don &apos;t have a car .
how did the residents react to their ter@@ raced house project ?
Gil@@ bert : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury cars for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely isn &apos;t right .
but do you not intensi@@ fy the competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ bert : true , however , we had a boom in Germany in the last five years , but built luxury apartments that can hardly afford to afford . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need housing . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the Mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ thi@@ ans alone . &quot;
I show how to make a good and easy to build today .
that &apos;s why it goes .

&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the supply gig@@ ant lowered its profit view to a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight forwarding and higher costs in his body@@ guard service . &quot;

&quot; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; business &quot; &quot; yields solid earnings if you consider the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of the Riv@@ ale UPS which plans to employ 900@@ ,000 to 95@@ .000 additional labour force , for example the same number as last year . &quot;

&quot; threatening above them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey seating sa@@ ver is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put forward the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from the Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is a un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be p@@ am@@ pered by the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero current interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that they are solid , the recent turbul@@ ences on the global financial markets are anx@@ ious to intensi@@ fy this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is also only a quarter of a percentage point . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the rate of interest , the increased uncertainty around the global market remains enough justi@@ fication , continues to wait , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus about what the F@@ ed will do what is poll@@ uted to the financial market .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the pro@@ position unless the strateg@@ ists reduce the impact by suggest@@ ing that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
topics : Banking ; Financial market trends ; Global financial markets ; International financial markets ; International financial system ; Key issues ; Super@@ vision and regulation
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , they would have to go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets so that they do not get panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a interest increase would calm the financial markets because it would be the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; another month ago the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , despite the dis@@ comforts of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the pro@@ position . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , improving on the labour market this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly running under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;

but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of the last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average Profit fell by more than 16 % below its peak as investors feared that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would dimin@@ ish global growth .
&quot; the market has recovered in this month , whereas the Dow is now up to almost 10 % below the ho@@ ch of May . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; when the events in the financial markets and news on the weakness of Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would appeal to the bre@@ eder , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. bank@@ note bank . &quot;
&quot; now , he assumes that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the world economy &apos;s health is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; in 2013 , the mere reference to Ben S. Bern@@ anke , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down its monetary expansion , &quot; triggered confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , the F@@ ed representatives can not only super@@ vise the developments elsewhere , but also advise on other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , apparently not associated with economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ ier , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , uses for interest in interest , cited in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower their lead by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , despite a limited acknowled@@ gement impact on the growth in the US , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; a year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts revers@@ ed . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition H@@ arm@@ sen Ut@@ esch@@ er Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences don &apos;t come close to this plane , he said . &quot;
&quot; you certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation where they are afraid of interest in interest , because the markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think they should rush ahead . &quot;

Brazilian Pa@@ edi@@ atric Association Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organisation Spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women about how important good nutrition during bre@@ ast@@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by approximately 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system neg@@ atively . &quot;

the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; eman@@ cip@@ ation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan on the roof inc@@ lin@@ ation does not permit &quot; exceptions &quot; - the Bern@@ hardt community is generally more restric@@ tive in exemp@@ tions with exemp@@ tions from exemp@@ tions . &quot;

&quot; the bridge festival association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able - organized by the Union of W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen , Germany . &quot;
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án reports further tens of thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of an apparent policy :
&quot; rather than in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , in order to help establish structures to ensure Human@@ eness , our Federal Chancellor has officially opened up the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ circle of National Socialism . &quot;
this policy is not only the Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions now in the border areas .
&quot; the refugees will also have to note that the &quot; &quot; blessed land &quot; &quot; that she has invited and welcomed , is nothing more than another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , in order to establish decent conditions for protective seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama of a recently mi@@ cked father , who decided to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached an impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics had asked whether Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and slightly hit the Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 a.m. to 5 : 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe , revealed on average 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30@@ h to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 people and in the second half an hour full 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ seat average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that Hot @-@ Seat will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .

and no one of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we arrive with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before three two are checked , you may acci@@ dentally have acci@@ dentally put an indication on who will be the winner . &quot;
© Warner Bros@@ . Entertainment Inc .
&quot; all three women have a ly@@ rical way out why wood is the perfect man , and they called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; could be their answers to the gam@@ bler who won the heart of the Bachel@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ o ki , both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood . &quot;
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and noticed Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought it was pretty compatible , and I thought it was the whole course of the show , &quot; &quot; Je@@ anne @-@ Fel@@ lows said . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on the earth with both feet on the ground , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; Mark@@ o added . &quot;
&quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the House visit last week her clear that Wood would be &quot; &quot; One . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now reserved for him , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked , whom Wood should choose if not she , she was pu@@ zzling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between Sne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams , who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year . &quot;
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
&quot; some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game , when he lost a triangle in such a way as the Aus@@ sie @-@ rug@@ by division converted his first p@@ unt return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return and also into the ongoing match after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sports reporter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by speci@@ alt@@ e@@ ams Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and to take care of the next game .
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ rolled in a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first playing area of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian bon@@ dage for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
&quot; after the f@@ um@@ ble , Hay@@ ne left the playing field and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine any worse start into his N@@ FL career . &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; in 2007 , Hay@@ ne works with his Origin debut at that time in 2007 , when a pass was brought to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area . &quot;

four people killed after polic@@ emen killed rubber deaths on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police demonstrated rubber deaths in a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital of Kath@@ mand@@ u . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , leading District officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said , the police used tear gas and fired them into the air before they came back to rubber . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber liners known that they can kill , but they are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , evi@@ dently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last few weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ irr@@ i say that new provinces formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been central to centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake which had killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature proposed this week on certain cl@@ auses in the Constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials stated that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;

&quot; for an easy over@@ weight diabetes , weight loss surgery may be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years Adi@@ posit@@ as surgery has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out for people who are ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight relative to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I from 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with BM@@ I above 30 are regarded as ob@@ ese . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data collected in a study in 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes for people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I under those who under@@ went this operation declined from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; however , the BM@@ I remained in those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who under@@ went a surgical procedure , 36 % of the type of diabetes dissolved in a total of 36 % and partly with 28 % . &quot;

the research team also adju@@ sts average results in two types of surgery .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show a survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was subjected to ob@@ ese people suffering from obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group using conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study has no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was comfor@@ ting for people with BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting for too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as they have accumulated these genetic modifications that have joined their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;

it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dal@@ ai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot take all the refugees , the Dal@@ ai Lama said and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leader demanded to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , devoted to ethics studies . &quot;
he called for that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries is ad@@ mi@@ red on the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as true peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we have to think about how the killing is dimin@@ ished in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke to the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action following the terrorist attack on September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the US drag@@ ged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know , his motives were good , but he put violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;
four times increase in taking pan@@ de@@ mic inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
&quot; tox@@ in control centres in the USA report about almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , who swal@@ low a strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of inf@@ ec@@ tious inf@@ ec@@ tious agents in children under 12 years of children under the age of 12 were reported to date from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more frequently on these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drinking dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants pur@@ pos@@ efully drinking , while some people do it to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube shows how young inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have bl@@ ended dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berries , grapes and orange scent , which are very appealing for children . &quot;
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; particularly in small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ ers can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the toxic emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around but people leave these hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ ers after straw@@ berry fra@@ grant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought to treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah sh@@ ou@@ ted her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had kno@@ cked her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very fear@@ ful , &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s mother , CNN . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with fat@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained toxic , non @-@ declared ingredients . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities suggest that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution , instead of eth@@ yl alcohol that was recorded as an active agent . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in New York planned to poison their &quot; gem@@ a &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , so it reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ish them out of their room .
&quot; the police looked at the vain plan as &quot; &quot; business &quot; &quot; and instruc@@ ted disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;

&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent , as the figures of the office for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed . &quot;

why I will be a witness of an exten@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except in a late legal Intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses for his death .
&quot; the invitation was made for the first time in January of his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew near@@ er , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agree , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications than places available , a ma@@ sted lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected . &quot;

I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps &apos;s closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we laugh often when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compla@@ ined about her .
&quot; they told them that &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; , &quot; but they still think that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to be present in order to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ingham , a reporter for Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary .
but I believe that a strong probability exists that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is no sufficient evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can apply for this .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying to die an unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish the race
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables and threatened to stop the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she passed a personal campaign against him with Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing , and he has found himself under difficult conditions when it went to the positive cob@@ alt ink sample with Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had held 18 months because of es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations , and didn &apos;t want it to see it as too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have a long time to eat , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it went on .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to move up@@ lifted head , and I want my owners think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity Department had tried to spy on his stable . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they apparently believe that I am a dec@@ ei@@ ver .
&quot; if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they have failed to grasp me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ der , chairman of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , the current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
go to the top of the page
is the R@@ V@@ L act committed and perhaps people are responsible for doing what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think outside that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it . &quot;
&quot; but I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will exercise pressure on them and press them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the Fru@@ str@@ ations Levels of the Train@@ ers have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching led to that he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ la@@ yed Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the rac@@ le treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse plane , which pushed the rules against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff was ab@@ rup@@ tly applied to the leg . &quot;
it would have been so late yesterday evening .
&quot; it could have been all the day yesterday , whatever it was . &quot;
but it was so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could face a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the rac@@ et@@ day . an investigation of this issue was opened .
it is a joke .
people who put these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his player as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; of two Premier League favorites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee judges have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring games &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hard @-@ pac@@ ed note to the Storm Team , after his team had finished the Final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land won &apos;t be too good . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ p of his team and said that they were concentr@@ ating only on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; during the Tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team were confident and confident , as it was obvious that they were worried about being defeated by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this is repeated again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring events when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles to a real focus , and this has provided us the trend revers@@ al . &quot;
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team . he is probably not used to lose it so it was a bit a shock for him .
&quot; it &apos;s already strange , as this occurs again at this time of the year . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and his ment@@ or reminded that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night , and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he would take care of a shit . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of soccer - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they can play . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they did not think of us when it was about the big games . &quot;
O@@ V showed that the Storm against Roo@@ sters achieved a higher score than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and do not point a bit of a bit of tension ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase . &quot;
the Storm team has released this weekend since they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin on the next Tuesday morning .

&quot; a man who may thre@@ aten a life @-@ long sentence because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which was s@@ mug@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested for the last month after the Federal Police took 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America over Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the J@@ ach@@ harbour during the morning and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially lifel@@ ong sentence for the attempt to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café a harm@@ less reason could have been . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape with Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs Mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 for security together to reach his release . &quot;
&quot; according to the reading of the impressive declarations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Richter Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be sufficient to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was acqu@@ itted against damage , filed under the conditions that he sends his Australian and Serbian passport to the police every day and stops at an initial stop of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone from girls to l@@ ure ped@@ oph@@ ile for sending pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the telephone of an 11 @-@ year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl when this fell asleep , log@@ ically placed in an online mess@@ aging service , which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children received by another user . &quot;
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping dog .
&quot; she saw it through , found the bew@@ il@@ dered messages and al@@ arming her mother immediately . &quot;
&quot; the police took care about and saw the five images , analyzed then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; Web research , &quot; the terms used for searching for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile in the Internet &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; pret@@ ended to be a polic@@ eman in order to fri@@ ghten them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ t@@ son said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court , &quot; he said it would be a addiction to fri@@ ghten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searching on the computer was done by him , but he said that he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and we@@ eping . &quot;
&quot; and then , she saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and con@@ front the accused with it . &quot;

every two years the car manufacturers show their innovations at the IAA .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; at present , cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations fell by the Federal Aviation Authority ( KBA ) in August alone in this segment . &quot;
this also reflects at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence Days 17th to 27th of September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic vehicles and luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car sector is the Opel Astra , which will stand in autumn at the dealers . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; as a result , the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra should not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen also offer additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only a fifth @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Combi , which can also be seen at the IAA . &quot;
and what is next to the Astra at the IAA ?

&quot; they can even hope for money when they were locked in confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this way , an ex @-@ prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 , and the toilet was spati@@ ally separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who is now on the free foot after his arrest , has been transferred to a larger cell . &quot;

&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we do this &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany after the German Federal Ministry of Interior Affairs this year , according to the statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even capable of receiving a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated decis@@ i@@ vely in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create this and we create it .
the following overview will give you an overview of what is coming to Germany .
&quot; according to various forecasts between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - namely the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments come out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly inexpensive apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot;

&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents put their children into the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; &quot; for the dec@@ eased parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ er , spokes@@ person for youth and family in Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; however , in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration will distribute leaf@@ lets in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators increase by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the capacity of training - for example by allowing more specialised training schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students will be prepared for classes without knowledge of German language skills . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ atic from Berlin School administration . &quot;

&quot; in future , Islam will play a more important role as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should embrace Islam as they have the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches have a right to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is important for the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers . &quot;
the rights belong to the rights .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam have to agree on clear persons and be willing to collaborate with the state in many areas and to grant them certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to host against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern on Thursday , wor@@ ries and religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; for those who wanted such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately their right to stay in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bavarian Radio . &quot;
he suggested to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change the disman@@ tling of discrimination and racism . &quot;
&quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since a scar@@ ce decade , an anti @-@ discrimination authority and a general equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the Nazi jun@@ ta series showed , in the police and authorities , the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored . &quot;
&quot; the same opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interests of non @-@ white German have long been calling for a long time , and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism ban on Germany must be reality when the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should be able to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of providing emergency medical assistance to previously expected refugees . &quot;

FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb must stand behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; in contrast to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , W@@ enger stressed that it was only September and if his rehabilitation follows the plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and given its history , its participation in the next summer on the European Championship is certainly uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the big shame on this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate knu@@ ck@@ les injury , and then returned to his old momentum during the season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in connection with his knu@@ ck@@ les , or with the injuries he had before . &quot;
&quot; this may be true of pure medical view , but as well recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd. records 23 different illnesses from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut before six years .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ es in the last five times .
&quot; the wider picture of Arsen@@ al is that they have been in six of eight times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs , who have noticed most of the vulner@@ abilities . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition H@@ arm@@ sen Ut@@ esch@@ er Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; sometimes when you come back from injury , you have a reasonable time , a time in which you strengthen your body and win battle force , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and run a career out of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and W@@ enger introduces a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey didn &apos;t travel to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
W@@ enger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep balance and to treat the players who need to treat a little break @-@ up , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; although arsen@@ al clear favorites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the largest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defe@@ ating after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , being measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al pulled the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains from far @-@ sigh@@ ted hope to lead the association to his first European cup triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it has never worked out at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other side I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ aming . &quot;

&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even more desperate than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year court . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and there are three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campaign against a pi@@ ti@@ ful life ) 2015 was the year of the man , with the aim to question the culture in question that men should seek help when they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that when the body had enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally wholes@@ ome friends hal@@ ves the risk of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of social media guided communication , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , lifel@@ i@@ rous and successful , even though the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psychologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner year@@ ning for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty at Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality defined by the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Joey and Chand@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when watching football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely go back to explore completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of the phone pastoral care told me : ... &quot; &quot; my listen@@ ers for people who feel depres@@ sive and mur@@ der@@ ous , really showed me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot;
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
she presents quite clearly the small moments of men friend@@ ships .
&quot; so very , my objective out@@ si@@ der status over the phone may also help people in moments of desp@@ air , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend comedy Central European Friend@@ s@@ Fest to celebrate the day completely new designed backdrop , why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re in Star@@ bucks someone alone , give him a smile and say Hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .

&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he later began playing against his hom@@ et@@ own team and against the club , with whom he started his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore it is a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his own place against Bor@@ deaux in the first league , but he was pushed out in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine flu@@ gel@@ ess was named as the man who was able to take the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis &apos;s Pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö @-@ Defence . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; at An@@ pi@@ ff , Mal@@ m@@ ö sm@@ iled in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed by Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G gave themselves sometimes up , with some bug@@ gies and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was in the first half p@@ atz@@ te in the first half and then abandoned after the restart of Cav@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; however , he showed much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which was directed by the Di Maria in a shot , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ... &quot;
&quot; the second goal finally fell short after the hours stamp , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ yer scored his sixth season tor after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had a left flank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended up all the thought that Mal@@ m@@ ö could come back into play , and only an excellent interven@@ ing from Wil@@ and in no short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before the waiting list Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognised by a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later became that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champ@@ ions league game was in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then we have only played in the Swedish League , which does not have the same level . &quot;

matt Dam@@ on is playing diversity in the film
&quot; matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said , they are not needed behind the scenes . &quot;
&quot; during a succession of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown broke out when it stressed the need for alternative perspectives , and in relation to a black prot@@ agon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted , with ins@@ ult@@ ed dis@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian changed . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the character of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a Nut@@ te , which is beaten by her white fe@@ eder . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replies that their direction &quot; &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement Black Li@@ ves Matter achieved nationwide action and urged leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against far@@ ce living . &quot;

Pro sport clim@@ ber and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero the first Ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prize of 1 Million $ at home .
&quot; the competition show , which concluded their 7th season , had never experienced an competition participant who could close all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Camer@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing at a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time , with which he was the first Ath@@ l@@ ete who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster than the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero talked with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still below the shock above the profit of the Grand Prize of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than 10,000 $ or for life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot;
as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer Kent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter , to discuss the fin@@ als and why Brit@@ ten , even though he was first at all , won &apos;t get any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , it receives the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , he gets the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ears any gro@@ ll about it .
he is just so happy to have what he did .

he is such a great guy and a family father .

Detroit Tig@@ ers over Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins over
the second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; in the past , they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are standing on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
the Tw@@ ins turned out a chance for Ascen@@ sion within a half of the Houston astro@@ s for the second American League wild@@ card .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; all vic@@ tories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Fal@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive supporting , when Detroit took three times in the first two categories , then once in the sixth and then again in the n@@ inth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and made three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen of each game , and so I want to go into the game completely . &quot;
&quot; the designed tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits , and was in two races , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle &apos;s Marin@@ ers on 6 July . &quot;
&quot; he has well dra@@ ined the sle@@ d@@ geh@@ ammer , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , saw clearly better out of the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three races in the rear at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back into play . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks got a Mul@@ liner and Simon put his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to the stri@@ ke@@ out before he replaced Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy passed down wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who was the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
with a pair of runners and the finale @-@ run the second brought Ver@@ hagen the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
&quot; it was that in the Major League for the 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe was hitting a double play &quot;
&quot; after Detroit at the end of the n@@ inth inn@@ ings added a Insurance @-@ Run , wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;

Detroit benefited from the start of the game by another no moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three races in the first two races against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been cancelled before the game of the injury list , after having missed more than one month because of a back pain . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started getting rid of and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after having received Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first place , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game , which made a single &quot; up the hour &quot; for the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in scoring position .
&quot; the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ ano followed with a single on the right side , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended . &quot;

&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; said Tw@@ ins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t hit particularly well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before he replaced A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter &apos;s reli@@ ever . &quot;

Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare
&quot; in the presence of the city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io hill was bapti@@ sed on the name of the German Re@@ formed Church on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; he is now considered &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of Protest@@ ant Churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , rec@@ alled on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants were often only able to live in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority . &quot;
the place will be visible in symbo@@ lic@@ ally that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian conv@@ ent around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .

hammer artist invested three years into personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown is one of the major works , the Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his personal interpretation of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old , but it is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; for three years , Ot@@ mar has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subjects of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are cycles , which are dedicated to topics such as cross @-@ way , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds , or fa@@ ther@@ land . &quot;
&quot; he immediately fascin@@ ated several partners spont@@ ane@@ ously : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological focus , as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the basis of painting with the particular bi@@ blical passages . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible texts selected by Ot@@ mar , and thus transl@@ ates into current connections . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ ati@@ m mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original text of Martin Luther and one set of the artist who formulated his own personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewelry clasp has gold c@@ ous@@ ins .
&quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; in the end , emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter orders . &quot;
&quot; the education already happened with the cane &quot; , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work that , in order to bring me back again with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to revi@@ ve art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed era : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is marked by rec@@ l@@ ame today , and it is loud . &quot;
symboli@@ sm will be pushed back .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer go into the pictures , let them discover and feel the strength they have : &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , who has always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; not to capture the Bible completely , but carefully selected for him , including mysterious themes . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on the eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; it came into being a picture Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen patterns - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15th at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
