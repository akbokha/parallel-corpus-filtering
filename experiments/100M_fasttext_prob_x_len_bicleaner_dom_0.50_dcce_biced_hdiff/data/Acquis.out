additional agreements on the agreement between the European Economic Community and its Member States and the Swiss Con@@ federation on watch@@ making
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering that on 30 June 1967 there was an agreement between the European Economic Community and its Member States and the Swiss Con@@ federation on watch@@ making goods signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering that it is necessary to make additional measures with regard to a smooth functioning of this agreement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the Ord@@ in@@ ance of the Swiss Federal Council of 23 December 1971 on the use of the Swiss name for watches , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering the close industrial cooperation between the European Economic Community and Switzerland in the field of the watch industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the knowledge that the ration@@ alisation funds granted by E@@ bau@@ ches SA and AS@@ U@@ AG will be abol@@ ished at the time of the entry into force of this agreement and that at the same time , the quota stated in point B 3 b ) is abol@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the customs cuts envis@@ aged in Articles 1 and 5 of the Agreement dated June 30 , 1967 , coinci@@ de simultaneously with this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 . the raw materials produced in the community , as well as the regulating components and other components manufactured in the community , are considered to be equivalent to quality such as raw plants and components of Swiss manufacturing with comparable technical properties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from these raw materials and components , clo@@ cks and clock@@ works must meet the requirements of the legal technical control in Switzerland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 . the list of raw materials produced in the Community is revised periodically , following the following procedures : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ) The application for admission of new raw materials in the list is directed by associations of the watch@@ making industry of the community or from the producers of raw plants resident to the Swiss watch@@ making chamber . the application is to be accompanied by a technical description of the raw material cali@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swiss watch@@ maker is wearing this , or the new cali@@ bers , immediately into the named list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the inclusion in the list for a raw material calibr@@ ator is requested that has already been used in Switzerland and has failed to pass the legal technical control in Switzerland , the Swiss watch@@ maker may refuse to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B ) The retention of the list of raw materials listed in the list is reported by the associations of the watch@@ making industry of the community or by the manufacturer who had applied for admission before the Swiss watch@@ maker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) If the requirements of statutory technical control in Switzerland have not been fulfilled , the Swiss watch@@ maker may demand the cancellation of the raw material cali@@ bers from the list ; it teaches the affected party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this does not agree , the procedure may take place within two months of the procedure referred to in paragraph 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D ) Every request to change the list according to the letters a ) , b ) and c ) will be immediately shown to the Joint Committee of the Swiss watch@@ making chamber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 . in the case of ordering the quality of the quality , the Commission agreed in Article 9 of the Agreement dated June 30 , 1967 , is immediately dealt with by the parties concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first acting party investig@@ ates itself from the Institute for Official Quality Control in the Swiss watch@@ making industry , as well as an appropriate institute of the community called by the Community of the Community to provide a joint expert opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this report , the institutes agree to take out watches or movements from a Swiss company and a company of the community , which is sufficiently representative and is basically no more than 50 clo@@ cks or movements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after checking these games according to the standards of legal technical control in Switzerland , the institutes compare their results and create a joint report for the Mi@@ xed Commission with their conclusions and with their potential suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the agreement and the list attached to him will be published in the official publications of the contracting parties , and communicated to the watch@@ makers by the relevant professional associations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least every three years , calculated by the entry into force of the agreement , the Mi@@ xed Commission proposes a re@@ design of the list to take account of the entries and car@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the agreement entered into force on 1 January 1973 , if the rati@@ fication was replaced by the rati@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have decided to achieve these objectives and consider that no provision of this agreement can be interpreted to remove the contracting parties from its obligations arising from other international agreements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have decided to achieve these objectives and consider that no provision of this agreement can be interpreted to remove the contracting parties from its obligations arising from other international agreements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the purpose of this agreement is to promote the harmonic development of economic relations between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Iceland , promoting economic life , improving life and employment conditions , increasing productivity and financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these prohi@@ bitions or restrictions may , however , be neither a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disgu@@ ised restriction of trade between the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

C ) The General Director will immediately inform all Member States of the Organization from any change in the Convention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) This Convention enters into force on the day in which the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that their procedures for entry into force are concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) This Convention shall remain in force , as long as the States Parties of the Treaty are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine , as necessary , in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of the preventive measures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the extraction of significant quantities of nuclear weapons for nuclear weapons and other nuclear missi@@ les for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rence of such degradation by the risk of early detection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to enrich the target set specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial confin@@ ement and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical completion of the follow @-@ up checks by the organisation is carried out by an explanation , in which material quantity is not specified for a certain period of time , indicating the accuracy limits for the given seas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when performing their follow @-@ up checks , the organization makes for articles 3 full use of the security system of the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when applying their security measures , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and measures of the following kind shall be used and they , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are determined in the supplementary agreements and are useful : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and stock quantities ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements , and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) Proced@@ ure for determination , examination and evaluation of differences in measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e ) Proced@@ ures for the assessment of accumulation of non @-@ measured invent@@ ories , and not measured losses ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system that evalu@@ ates the stock material inventory and changes in the material balance zone for each material balance zone , including the one and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g ) precau@@ tions , which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
h ) Proced@@ ures for the reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the security measures after this Convention do not extend to material in mining , mining or mining . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) Intro@@ duc@@ es the amount and composition of the material described under the letter c ) , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of the fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured , or is this kernel or other material produced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circulation system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) The security measures provided in this Convention are concluded for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions specified in Article 11 are not made possible or desirable , the organization and the community should consult each other on the application of appropriate security measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) The securing measures provided in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , unless the organization and the community agree that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upon request of the Community , the organization exemp@@ ts the following core material from the security measures following this agreement : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) special fis@@ sile material , if it is used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if delivered nuclear material is to be processed or stored together with nuclear material , which is subject to the security measures in accordance with this Convention , provisions for the re@@ use of securing measures are taken on that material . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements , which are necessary to determine the successful and effective completion of the tasks of the organisation according to this agreement , as the procedures specified in the Convention are applicable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the supplementary agreements can be extended or altered without alteration of the Convention , in agreement between the organization and the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organization , the community and the states undertake every effort to make these agreements into force within 90 days of the entry into force of the Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the initial report given in Article 62 , the organisation provides a summari@@ zed inventory of the core material underlying backup measures in the States , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory based on the following reports and the results of their follow @-@ up checks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EW@@ G has decided to contribute to the special action plan laid down at the conference for international economic cooperation , in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general help problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C ) It is the purpose of the E@@ EC and Member States that the entire contribution of the Member States is bound to the entry into force of the agreement within six months and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle @-@ bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , the E@@ EC Organisation has presented a table that is obvious in what manner it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special transaction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which states the member states in accordance with this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special transaction account is managed separately , separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment is made in the form of cash or in@@ es@@ sion@@ able bonds of the member state which is to be paid upon request in the currency of the respective State for the organization of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the deposit of the organization in the respective country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) The payment is made in two instal@@ ments , and i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the Administrator of the time ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
II ) the second amounting to the residual amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker taking into account the periods required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) E@@ ach Member State may make payments in advance of the above mentioned dates , if requested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker is taking about proportional draw to cash or the j@@ ail@@ le@@ ash to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and balance the special action account in an appropriate manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in granting this loan , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the E@@ EC : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( III ) to the extent , in which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit capacity to loan terms , without any delay ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VII ) to the extent , in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each transaction loan is designed to finance a clearly defined and rapidly @-@ paid development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral analysis ) , regardless of whether it is the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices designated by the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of the principal means of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of entry into force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from Section 4 , special loans are subject to the same withdrawal conditions which are generally accepted for the development loan granted by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able during ten free years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the member states and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amounts to the payment of this watch must be paid directly to the organization , which they retain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every special loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the revenue from any special transaction loan may be used for spending in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are manufactured ( ii ) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which of the car@@ et@@ aker at the time of loan guarantee could be the recipient of a special loan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as possible , the amount paid in the currency of a Member State is to be transferred from the administrator to the Member State as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the complete allocation of all the special transactions , the manager will inform the E@@ EC about the projects and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the examination by the directors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the period of payment of the special loan loan , the administrator advised the E@@ EC quarterly on the development of the special loan loan and the expenditure on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the administrator noti@@ fies E@@ EC as soon as possible after the completion of the business year of the organization a detailed billing of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organisation for this account conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC will send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are paid to the account and the amounts paid out of the account , and the withdraw@@ als to the Member States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ EC and the administrators are working closely to achieve the goals of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full issue of the funds of the special transaction account , carry out an exchange of opinions about the status of the special transaction account and all the other questions concerning the provisions of this Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement is not in force on December 31 , 1978 or at a later date that the E@@ EC and the organization may agree not into force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and transferred to Member States , this agreement and all the obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC , according to the proced@@ ural regulations of each party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the governments of the Member States notified the Council of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sec@@ retariat shall forward these noti@@ fications , together with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications at the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each word is equally binding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas the agreement in the form of a letter change to the amendment of the An@@ nex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T has en@@ acted the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Society , herein@@ after referred to as Eur@@ atom , represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and THE Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as Switzerland , represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Federal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this program covers the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET Project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , the construction and operation of a joint venture according to Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for several years , Switzerland has been involved in research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as to the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion , extensive work is carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties to sum@@ mar@@ ise their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ lap and to accelerate their respective research that has attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement will enable every contracting party to take the greatest possible benefit by merging its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve the goal of the present agreement , the parties associate their respective research programmes defined in An@@ nex I and II , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every time the parties accept a new program , this will take place in the section of the programs listed in An@@ nex I and II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association , envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 , is realised by : - adequate participation of any of the parties during the preparation and implementation of the other party programmes ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- The replacement of personnel under the respective laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States in Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement as well as the laboratories participating in the Eur@@ atom Programme ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of this agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET Project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the association agreement provided in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this agreement , the Parties shall include an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the realization of the Eur@@ atom Programme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the same objective Eur@@ atom is responsible for ensuring that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of personnel sharing that is concluded between the Commission and the Associ@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to J@@ ET &apos;s participation in the J@@ ET Project , Switzerland is part of the Joint Company J@@ ET which accepts them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom also ensures that the Swiss contract partner can become a contractual partner for every contract , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organs involved in carrying out the association provided in article 2 , 1 of the present agreement are described in Articles 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in association agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be thank@@ ful if you would confirm with me the consent of your government , to the preceding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I teach you to confirm the receipt of your present writing , with the following wording : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm me with the consent of your government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of an exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States as part of the medium @-@ term financial support
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ Z could close stand @-@ by credit cards with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks provide a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the agreements could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor land , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future deplo@@ y@@ ments of the member countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some conditions are already listed below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with every stand @-@ by credit , the BI@@ Z would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without a total of five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the opening of the loans , as well as in any extension , the BC@@ Z would charge a credit opening vision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the first draw would not be made before the end of a month after completion of the Stand@@ by Agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the draw would take place in the currencies available at the BC@@ Z , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods which would be dealt with in consideration of the Bank &apos;s funds , presumably three or six months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conditions would correspond to those applying the BI@@ Z at the respective time on similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the BI@@ Z has to obtain the necessary funds on the market itself , then the interest rate for the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to the current Li@@ bor rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ Z could close stand @-@ by credit cards with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if banks provide a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the form of an exchange between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic , trade with h@@ amm@@ el and lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations regarding the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - fresh or cooled hammer , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina ple@@ dges to ensure that the agreed amount of the annual quantity does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out according to traditional offer forms ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a change in the supply form is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties agree to each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned below , in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the community uses the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Argent@@ inian access to the community market is not affected by this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion upon imports of products collected by this agreement , to a Ho@@ ech@@ st of 10 BC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community will change with Argentina under number 2 , according to the scale of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new member state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the import burdens for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , which is invo@@ iced as the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total quantity mentioned under the number 2 is set with the day of accession to the community to 23 000 tonnes of battle body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could adver@@ sely affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb in the joint market within the agreed quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the Community makes provisions so that the sales of frozen meat in frozen meat are not under@@ mined because of the Ord@@ in@@ ance of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking account of the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual use of reimbur@@ sement or other promotion measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb and lamb shall only be considered in accordance with existing international obligations and take account of the traditional share of international trade with these products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these terms must be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T ( Article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention for Design and Application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of General In@@ ch and Trade Agre@@ ements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Argentina guarantees that this agreement is adher@@ ed to , in particular by the amount of export lic@@ ences laid down in this agreement for the products listed under the number 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in turn , the community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary arrangements for the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina from the submission of an export license , which is given by the authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way , that the position of a security deposit will be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of the goods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , in implementing regulations , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority in the competent authority of the Community regul@@ ates the amounts for the export lic@@ ences ; these statements may be en@@ coded according to destination country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement is properly applied , and works smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regularly examines the tendency towards the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat markets of both parties and on the global market as well as the terms of sales in these markets , including the conditions mentioned under the number 7 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper use of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , Lamb and goat meat shall be carried out under the agreement of the applicable collective numbers according to the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee shall discuss all questions arising from the implementation of these agreements , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the provisions of this agreement apply irrespective of the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the annual quantity , set at number 2 , is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount arising from the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year is determined in proportion to the total annual amount , and takes account of the seasonal character of trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the contract is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand , on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after this time , it remains in force , subject to the right of every party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the provisions of this Agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you agree with the consent of your government , I would be thank@@ ful for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I honor to confirm the receipt of your present writing with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I dev@@ ote myself to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations regarding the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina ple@@ dges to ensure that the agreed amount of the annual quantity does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out according to traditional offer forms ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion upon imports of products collected by this agreement , to a Ho@@ ech@@ st of 10 BC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community will change with Argentina under number 2 , according to the scale of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new member state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the import burdens for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , which is invo@@ iced as the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would share the consent of your government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honor to share with you the consent of my government with the content of your letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ad@@ ore myself to agree on the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations regarding the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the community in conjunction with the application of the regulation governing a common market organisation for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recognizing the fact that the sheep market and the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb after the world market and especially after the community for New Zealand is not affected , I honour myself to propose the following agreements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled hammer , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with this agreement , New Zealand will ensure access to the market of the community in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal paragraph of his h@@ amm@@ el and lamb is not affected by the application of the regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand comm@@ its itself to ensure that the actual amount of the annual amount does not exceed the set amount . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the quantities stated above are executed in traditional offer forms , frozen or ch@@ illed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented from using new technological developments , or maintain its competitive position in the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a change in the supply form is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two contractual parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in clause 10 mentioned above in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the community uses the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to protect New Zealand &apos;s interests resulting from this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products collected by this agreement , to a Ho@@ ech@@ st of 10 BC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the accession of new member states , the Community in New Zealand changes the quantities stated in clause 2 according to the extent of New Zealand trade with each new member state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the import burdens for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , which shall be invo@@ iced in clause 5 of the Ho@@ ech@@ stone Ex@@ termination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total amount stated in clause 2 is set on the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community on 2@@ 45 500 tons of battle body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the normal sales of New Zealand &apos;s h@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the Community makes provisions so that the sales of frozen meat in frozen meat are not under@@ mined for this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the two contracting parties undertake everything in order to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ hausen in the community without any risk to market stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual use of funds or other promotion measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb and lamb and lamb shall only be considered in accordance with existing international obligations and take account of the traditional share of international trade with these products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Zealand guarantees compliance with the quantities stated in clause 2 , in particular that there are no export lic@@ ences to these quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in turn , the community comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions in order for the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in New Zealand on the submission of an export license issued by the New Zealand government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way , that the position of a security deposit will be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of the goods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented from using new technological developments , or maintain its competitive position in the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a change in the supply form is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two contractual parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in clause 10 mentioned above in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blood flow is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is gli@@ de through a closed , sterile tube system into a sterile bottle containing the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution before steri@@ li@@ zing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after termination of blood withdrawal , the bottle is immediately shut down and cooled down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . thereafter it may only be opened immediately prior to the use of the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution should not exceed 220 ml per litre of human whole blood , and the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration must not fall under 97 g per litre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is determined previously by the blood cells and serum ; determination of the r@@ h factor is carried out by examining the blood cells at a new probe of the don@@ or blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insofar as there are standardized or recommended procedures for blood group identification in individual countries , they are to be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the designation R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific tests have yiel@@ ded the non @-@ existence of the anti@@ gens , C , D , Du and E . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the blood di@@ pped after this Convention is to be used only for receivers of the respective AB @-@ 0 group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human whole blood is to be stored in sterile , closed bottle against micro @-@ organisms ; higher temperatures are permissible only during testing and transport necessary times which may be at most 30 minutes to cool down once again to 4 to 6 C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unit of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , from which the majority of the plasma has been removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been gained ; other blood cell components may be present or may have been partially removed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fluid content of the concentr@@ ates consists either of the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial wat@@ ery solution , which has been added after removal of the plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product , but if a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , the approximate percentage of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit ) is indicated on the label . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all processes required for the production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the sealing must be carried out using a sterile , closed system and only by pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contracting parties of the European Convention on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin , dated 15 December 1958 , are ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Con@@ ventions &quot; ) - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on Article 5 ( 1 ) of the Convention , which &quot; parties to meet all necessary measures , &quot; to liber@@ ate the therapeutic substances made available to them by the other parties ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas for the member states of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this exemp@@ tion falls into the competence of the Community which has been established by the authority which has the authority to do so ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas in the article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention , it is necessary that the European Economic Community can become the contracting party of the Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Convention enters into force for the community on the first day of the month , which follows the signing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first day of the month , it enters into force that follows the day after which the last of the contracting parties has deposited its acceptance certificate at the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2 ) This additional protocol takes effect after two years at the time of acceptance , unless one of the parties has notified a objection to his entry into force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from that point onwards , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention without becoming a contracting party of the supplementary protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , all states and the European Economic Community in accordance with Article 2 and the time of entry into this additional protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary @-@ General also noti@@ fies the European Economic Community any action , notification or communication relating to this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas in case of need of European solidarity , member states support each other in the spirit of European solidarity during the procurement of re@@ agents for blood group identification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas this reci@@ pro@@ cal support is only possible when the constitution and use of these re@@ agents are subject to regulation by the Member States , and the necessary facil@@ itation and exemp@@ tions for their import@@ ation are granted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sense of this agreement , the term &quot; re@@ agents for blood group identification &quot; re@@ agents human , animal , plant and other origin to blood group determination and determination of blood ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any contracting party may limit the application of this Convention on re@@ agents of human origin to blood group determination by an explanation of the application of this agreement or accession to rati@@ fication , approval or accession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the declaration can be withdrawn at any time by a notification addressed to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parties are oblig@@ ated to leave re@@ agents to determine the costs of their extraction , preparation and transportation as well as the purchase price of other parties which are urgently needed , provided they have sufficient supplies for their own needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents for blood group identification are provided only under the condition , that no profit is associated with it , that they are only used for medical purposes and only to be provided by the governments involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each shipment of re@@ agents to blood group identification is to add a certificate , that they have been manufactured according to the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protocol and its installation represent an administrative agreement , which may be am@@ ended or modified by the governments of the Parties to this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parties shall take all necessary measures to liber@@ ate the re@@ agents provided by other parties to the blood group , from all input taxes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , they all meet all necessary measures to ensure that these substances travel quickly and quick@@ est in article 3 recipients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parties agree with each other on the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe , a list of places authorized to issue the articles provided in Article 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in article 6 of the European Convention , these positions should be identical regarding the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Convention is to be signed for the members of the Council of Europe , by signing it a ) without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Convention enters into force one month after the day , on which three members of the Council have signed and rati@@ fied or rati@@ fied according to Article 7 of rati@@ fication or approval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for each member , which is signed by rati@@ fication or approval of this Convention , or rati@@ fied or approved , it enters into force a month after its signature or the deposit of rati@@ fication or approval certificate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upon entry into force of this agreement , the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe can invite any non @-@ member state to join the Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Council &apos;s members and the member states a ) the time of entry into this agreement and the names of the members who have signed it or rati@@ fied or approved by the rati@@ fication or approval ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement , subject to a period of one year , by indication of the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen , which is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or another on the label . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) ha@@ em@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ti@@ ter is measured by repeatedly di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be tested , on double in a suitable medium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tit@@ er is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serv@@ itude di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated exclusively of the volume of blood flow in the total volume .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed through time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Health Organization has established international standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B , as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group identification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the tracks observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most speci@@ ali@@ zations is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ational sti@@ cker which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in a er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te @-@ flus@@ hing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ti@@ ter indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mixture within a series , in which a micro@@ scopic ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group identification , for the International standard preparations , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of unknown re@@ agents ( see Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B S@@ eren will contain 256 international units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards in the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following table shows an example of a similar ration of the International standard ser@@ ums Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should remain for at least one year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agent in liquid form , according to label , is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents , based on the label , depends on the results of the feasibility trials ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can enter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 BC of its weight , if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) can be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein Nit@@ rogen per ml , dissolved or re@@ dissolved serum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after replacement , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the re@@ agents for blood group identification should not be arti@@ ficially colored for international exchange , at least as long as there is no international agreement about a uniform system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination are in such a way that the re@@ agents present in a container are not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to perform tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the quantity , which is in a container , must be so large that the content may be used to perform the efficacy tests described in this protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manufacturing laboratory has written records on all stages of production and control of the re@@ agents for blood group identification .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appropriate specimens of all re@@ agents are to be stored for a long time from the laboratory , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective contribution to the strengthening of the effectiveness and preserving the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective interest in three groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or vegetable re@@ agents may not contain substances of human origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on each single container , a black @-@ and @-@ white printed label can be attached in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 . the quantity or quantity of liquid required for re @-@ dissolution of dried re@@ agents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers are : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 . the quantity or quantity of liquid required for re @-@ dissolution of dried re@@ agents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each consi@@ gn@@ ment shall be enclosed according to Article 4 of the Convention , according to the agreement on this protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of selected persons in the B group , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of the group A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells that contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of group A and AB including sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding comparison of blood to ti@@ tr@@ ate A@@ 1 , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in no case , the effectiveness of the serum may not be less than 64 international units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A Ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with a same quantity of 5 to 10 percent flus@@ hing of A@@ 1 , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells , which is required if the same attempt is performed with the same avi@@ dity of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B serum is obtained from the blood of selected group A , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of the B group B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells that contain B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ ates no human red blood cells that contain no B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparison of blood to ti@@ tr@@ ate B @-@ blood cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same quantity of 5 to 10 percent flus@@ hing of B @-@ blood cells , which is required if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is obtained from the blood of selected persons of the group 0 which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of group A and group B .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ am@@ ates human red blood cells that contain ag@@ glut@@ inus A and / or B i.e. those of group A including sub@@ groups A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ ates no human red blood cells that do not contain ag@@ glut@@ inus A or B i.e. those of the group 0 .
ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are generally not ag@@ glut@@ inated by anti @-@ A serum levels of blood don@@ ors ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding comparison of blood cells to ti@@ tr@@ ate against in@@ und@@ ations of A1 and A2 blood cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparison of blood to ti@@ tr@@ ate B @-@ blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in no case , the effectiveness of the serum may not be less than 64 international units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
un@@ dil@@ uted Anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause an easily recognizable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 percent flus@@ hes of A1 and A2 blood cells is required , which is required if the same tests are performed with the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ ums or with a standard preparation of the same activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed to an object carrier with an equal quantity of 5 to 10 percent flus@@ hing of B @-@ blood cells , which is required if the same attempt is performed with the same avi@@ dity of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with the same quantity of 5 to 10 percent flus@@ hing of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera of any speci@@ f@@ ity may belong to one of two types , which differ from the conditions under which ag@@ glut@@ ination is achieved hom@@ olo@@ ger blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as beef alb@@ um@@ in , or by means of other special methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ inate on object carriers also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are inv@@ oked in their own serum or plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following requirements for the efficacy of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may be changed if International standard preparations are available ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons immune to the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h @-@ System .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen , but not with human red blood cells which do not contain an@@ tigen D . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 versus C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ cent sal@@ ine solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the in@@ complete Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) serum or a corresponding comparison of blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen , the serum is supposed to react with blood cells that do do @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a which is intended for use of object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people that are immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h @-@ System .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it re@@ acts with in@@ und@@ ations of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells which do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , these Ser@@ a are only specific for the C an@@ tigen when the tested blood cells are charged in a 0.@@ 9@@ cent sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tit@@ er of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .
anti @-@ C Ser@@ a which is intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people that are immune to the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h @-@ System .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) should have a Tit@@ er of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a which is intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and in no form Anti @-@ D ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera of the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised individuals or can be produced by mixing Anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time in all types of red blood cells that show a reaction is not lower than with the opposite antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A Ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with an equal quantity of 5 to 10 percent flus@@ hing of A@@ 1 , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells , which is required if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells that contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ ates no human red blood cells that contain no B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparison of blood vessels ( 1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same quantity of 5 to 10 percent flus@@ hing of B @-@ blood cells , which is required if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

( 2 ) Use of paragraph 1 shall not be linked to a special condition of the competent authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , due to the special provisions on consi@@ gn@@ ment consi@@ gn@@ ments , the competent authorities can fores@@ ee that the form@@ alities for export and the shipping process are based on the same pre @-@ pressure provided for these form@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cases of the article 7 , the competent authorities are convinced of the fact that the data contained in the individual process sections of the registration must coinci@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this capacity , the representative of the Commission would have the right to ask for the word and to participate in meetings , but would not have the possibility to change the agen@@ das of meetings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be thank@@ ful if you would tell me if these agreements are acceptable , as the basis of a co @-@ operation between your Council and the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I assume that this letter and your answer will be the agreement on co @-@ operation between the International Council for Marine Research and the European Economic Community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I allow me to propose the following agreement which will serve as the basis for a cooperation between the European Economic Community and the International Council for Marine Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 . the European Economic Community , represented by its Com@@ mis@@ son , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; can ask for recommendations concerning the management of fish stocks and related questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 . the Council and the Commission will regularly discuss how the cooperation between the two parties will be intensified , and in particular the possibilities of the Com@@ mis@@ son to establish a closer connection with the Council &apos;s advisory board committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every party has the opportunity , at any time , to withdraw from the agreement with a one @-@ year notice period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to clause 3 , the Council agrees to identify a scientifically qualified representative of the Commission to observe observer status during meetings of the Advisory Committee on F@@ ish@@ eries Management of the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I assume that this letter and your answer will be the agreement on co @-@ operation between the International Council for Marine Research and the European Economic Community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I teach you to tell you that the Council is in agreement with the content of your letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the assumption that the development of the technology and structures of international trade makes significant changes to the Brussels Trade Agreement dated December 15 , 1950 , concerning the tari@@ ffs for the import of goods into tariff tari@@ ffs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , IN THE consideration that the degree of differentiation required by governments and the economy for customs and statistical purposes is currently far beyond that which is included in the system to the aforementioned agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the assignment , it is important to have precise and comparable data in international trade negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in DER occup@@ ancy , the harmon@@ ised system for the cargo tari@@ ffs and traffic statistics of the various types of transport should be used , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the assignment that the harmon@@ ised system is determined , as far as possible to be included in the systems used in the trade , for the identification and encoding of the goods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the assignment that the harmon@@ ised system should contribute to a close interaction between the import and export trade statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the other hand , IN THE magnitude that a close relationship between the Harmon@@ ised System and the International Trade Directory for the Foreign Trade ( S@@ IT@@ C ) of the United Nations should be maintained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the assignment that it is desirable to comply with the requirements listed above through a combined tariff and statistical cl@@ ature order , which is suitable for use by the international trade parties involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the assumption that it is important to ensure the adaptation of the harmon@@ ized system to the development of technology and structures of international trade , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the work carried out by the Council for Cooperation in the field of customs services , the Committee has provided for the Harmon@@ ised System in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - although the aforementioned agreement has proven to be an effective instrument to achieve some of these objectives , the conclusion of a new international agreement is the most appropriate way to achieve the desired result - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sense of this agreement , a &quot; harmon@@ ized system &quot; is called &quot; harmon@@ ized system &quot; consisting of positions and sub @-@ positions with the corresponding code numbers , from the notes to paragra@@ phs . chapters and sub@@ positions as well as the general rules for the interpretation of the harmon@@ ized system ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the assignment , that without a change of Article 13 of the above Convention , the Convention would continue to remain uncertain - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Article 13 of the International Convention , concluded on 14 June 1983 in Brussels on the harmon@@ ised system for the designation and codi@@ fication of the goods , in the following &quot; Con@@ ventions , &quot; paragraph 1 shall receive the following version : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
