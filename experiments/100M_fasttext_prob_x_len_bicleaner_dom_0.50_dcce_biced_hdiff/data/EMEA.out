&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Department report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need more information about your illness or their treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you would like more information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of EP@@ AR ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , in which patients have various episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) with periods of normal mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have approached the medicine in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased anxiety or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if oral consumption of the medication is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both diseases , the solution can be applied to intake or the melting tablets used in patients who prepare the swal@@ lowing of tablets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy should be reduced , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably acts mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , has a lower degree than neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , which prevents recur@@ rence of symptoms , has been studied in three studies of up to one year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders , which led to increased agitation , over a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo , in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that led to increased un@@ rest led by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all studies , the patient &apos;s symptoms were examined based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients receiving treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets , and the solution for intake ( absor@@ bs ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger in reducing symptoms than those receiving a placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in applying for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously untreated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses , Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions also reduced the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ di@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled access ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , nausea and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Dru@@ gs ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in treating schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in cases of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l compared to the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the Committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of injection solution for fast control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder should prevail over the risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and discussed their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efficacy of AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset , or after menop@@ ause , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ing for hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia are treated with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , consider reducing the dose or break the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , must be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with cra@@ mps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in cases associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was however , in one of these studies , a study involving fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs including AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poly@@ di@@ poles , poly@@ urine , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding the deterioration of glucose levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to serious complications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is recommended if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally administered medications containing super@@ imposed side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the H@@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study involving healthy subjects , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should be carried out similar dos@@ ages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism can result in joint application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites .
considering the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and should therefore be carried out similar doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after placing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dose of AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be raised to the dose height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y can be calculated with a moderate rise in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy morph@@ ine ratio ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant , or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data storage for safety in humans and because of the concerns caused in the reproductive studies of the animal , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fo@@ etus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including force vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant adverse events ( * ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study for 52 weeks a lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia was compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients was placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol therapy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long @-@ term follow @-@ up period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , with potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , abnormal cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliberate over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without a death sequence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that Hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosage as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is suspected that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partially antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity with dop@@ amine D@@ 4 and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - and to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day , the posit@@ ron @-@ emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent decrease in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucleus cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ ative . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 was the proportion of respon@@ der patients receiving a response to study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current values from Mess@@ scales , defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ mine depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher rate of rel@@ ap@@ se was found at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % in placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study for schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , with significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage of 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo over 3 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study , over 3 weeks with fixed doses of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a week 3 and an effect effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole reported a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia on such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ian patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole prior to random@@ ization a re@@ mission was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar recur@@ rence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on in vitro studies , the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes are responsible for Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ulation is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in approximately 75 hours , the middle Eli@@ min@@ ation H@@ alb@@ al period is about C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 14@@ 6 hours with &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites above C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy subjects , as well as showed no gender @-@ related effects in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pop @-@ up @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences in respect to the eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C for liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and potential carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not be recognized by any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent anc@@ illary toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day ( the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) .
also a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of the sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the concentrations found in human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ alle by monkeys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages , which led to positions of the 3 and 11@@ ples of the average Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , daily independent of meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets , can alternatively use the melting tablets as alternative to AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavi@@ ors is related to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , in some cases after onset or after menop@@ ause , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage of 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo over 3 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 58 in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which sometimes did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were evaluated according to dos@@ ages , which were considered to be an extension of the 3 and 11@@ x of the average Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical trials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets , can alternatively use the melting tablets as alternative to AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs including AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 92 In a clinical study involving healthy subjects , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is suspected that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partially antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study for schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , with significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study , over 3 weeks with fixed doses of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) in a relative bio@@ availability study .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages , which led to positions of the 3 and 11@@ ples of the average Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y injec@@ tions solution is used for rapid control of in@@ toxic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injec@@ tions should be terminated and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection in the M.

a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicine used already for maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the features of the drug to AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets , AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y melt tablets or AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no investigations into the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injec@@ tions in patients with a@@ toxic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that have been caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , the patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal medicines ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ing for hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ n are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poly@@ di@@ poles , poly@@ urine , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding the deterioration of glucose levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or lead to serious complications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared with the after sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) were intra@@ muscular and at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) intra@@ muscular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 105 The H@@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites can result in joint application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - protein inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and should therefore be carried out similar doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after placing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dose of AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be raised to the dose height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) received intra@@ muscular , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared with the after sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following side effects were more common in clinical trials involving Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole injec@@ tions ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant adverse events ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 107 Side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo , or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant adverse events ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients was placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , with potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increases in CP@@ K ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of in@@ toxic@@ ity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as a@@ gi@@ ti@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed average recovery from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo and 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aspir@@ ation , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population , but a statistical significance kan@@ z could be detected due to a reduced number of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 was the percentage of respon@@ der patients receiving a response to study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current values from Mess@@ scales , defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale showed significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia a significantly higher rate of rel@@ ap@@ se was reduced to 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study for schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , with significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 weeks study extension for some patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection 90 % larger the AU@@ C after receiving the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , average time was up to 3 hours to achieve maximum plasma levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole In@@ jection Solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) which was 15@@ - or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity according to intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns were found after mat@@ ernal exposure involving 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and potential carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not be recognized by the human being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; in this way they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects covered a dose @-@ dependent anc@@ illary toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al glands with 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 @-@ fold mean @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) .
in addition a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of the sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average level @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages which led to expos@@ ures of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold of the mid @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study , involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering only the patients treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference between drug efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of disease and survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it may not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es in the blood prior to the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs did not have to be given to other medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients whose first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and is not shown for the treatment of a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy degrees 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached at grade 1 or 2 , and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. , and 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no studies with impaired ren@@ al function have been carried out and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impaired ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 , due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which could have considerably different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients , no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number is increased again &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a unique cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac inf@@ estation in the indicated patient population is not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in the patients after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practise an effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ eption method , during and up to one month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised , during and up to six months after treatment no child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; male patients should be advised to consult a sperm conservation before the treatment , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane exists the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the traffic ti@@ ghtness and the ability to operate machinery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following , the most common and most important occur@@ ren@@ ces of side effects reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with 260 mg / m2 of abrasion once every three weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most notable hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of the patients ) and was rapidly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; table 1 shows the side effects that have occurred in conjunction with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , blo@@ ating , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain in the lower abdom@@ en , pain in the lower abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of the mus@@ cul@@ ature , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , chest pains , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ icro@@ bial agent that promotes the merging of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the gran@@ ules and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing its dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabilization leads to in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network which is essential for the vital phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ otheli@@ al cells and demonstrated in vitro studies that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in supports the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ d@@ otheli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ bic@@ receptor and performs a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor due to the protein @-@ binding protein SP@@ ARC ( glut@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two random@@ ised un@@ affiliated trials and of 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this multi@@ center study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks or in the form of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a reduced general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ a cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only due to metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy , are explained below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy degrees 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for the sound on bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the field of active substance exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 10 After the intraven@@ ous application of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in multi@@ phase manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or transmission of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearing of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection and the distribution volume was higher with Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is met@@ abo@@ lized primarily to 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma the mean value of the un@@ modified total dose was 4 % of the total dose of 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of more than 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box , protected against light light over 8 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ cancer @-@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into an Abra@@ x@@ ane flow bottle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after adding the solution , the bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid material . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the bottle should be slowly and cau@@ ti@@ ously til@@ ted and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes , until complete reset of the powder is carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if mal@@ formations or sin@@ ks are visible , the bottle must be inver@@ ted once again in order to achieve complete res@@ us@@ board before applying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated for the patient and inj@@ ected in an empty , sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member states must ensure that the holder of approval for the market launch will provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• Training Bro@@ ch@@ ure • Sum@@ mary of the features of the medicine ( specialist information ) ; lab@@ eling and packaging supplement . • with unique pic@@ torial representation of the correct application of the product provided cool@@ ers for transport by patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same drug ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , in which complications of blood trans@@ fusion may occur if there is no bleeding or bleeding from 900 to 1 800 ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is shown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with kidney problems and for patients who want to make their own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injection can also be performed by the patient or its car@@ egi@@ ver , provided they have received appropriate guidance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure and for patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be at the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the iron values of all patients are to be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or thereby indicating that the body does not adequately address the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was incorporated into the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with 4@@ 79 patients in a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients , which suffered an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected in a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also presented the results of a study , in which the effects of cut@@ aneous ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined for 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study involving patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as with those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison , the patients who continued receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the starting value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) like sudden , p@@ ung@@ ent mig@@ ra@@ ine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as injec@@ tions under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions occurring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for se@@ amed according to the European Union regulations , the medicine has shown a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company that manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals across all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ aid P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the placing of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma , which is a risk of trans@@ fusion due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre@@ existing an@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.@@ 2 - 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient in case of a large blood flow rate ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic procedure in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected loss of blood from 900 @-@ 1800 ml can be applied not to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients with the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and as a result may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rise in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed on or under the hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of these hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability an appropriate dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) exceeds the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose , which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b @-@ value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b @-@ value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by an intraven@@ ous application if necessary with an increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and subsequent symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of these hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability an appropriate dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose , which is required for controlling the an@@ emia symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ cular number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the output value , the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te number &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l is increased , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ cular number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l should be maintained three times a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ cular number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value the response to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 @-@ 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ges@@ tions is required , should be kept in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body@@ weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to the surgical procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; iron substitution should be started as early as possible , for example a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the se@@ amed therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and on the day of the surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients suffering from the treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ dr@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia ( PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ esia known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ sis ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe coron@@ ary heart disease , peripheral vascular disease , peripheral vascular disease , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with sudden loss of effect , defined as a reduction in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be examined and the common causes of non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if no other reason of an effective loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te antibodies are determined and an examination of the bone cord for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be measured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk of severe cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimul@@ ant drugs ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that can be attributed to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased to the concentration of an@@ a@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary heart disease or in@@ suffici@@ ency in maintenance therapy the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the time available , an@@ a@@ emia associated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for tumour patients under chemotherapy a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be considered ( patients who may have to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment under the participation of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure , if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients undergoing a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular disease , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events may not be excluded in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or decrease the risk of tumour progression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy , when hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when applied with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be controlled by C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the rising hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of interactions between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ y@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension .
higher incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the genetically recovered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sides and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate part with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin that was isolated from the urine of an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3@@ 89 patients with ha@@ em@@ bla@@ stom@@ osis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ as , 23 breast carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate cancer , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 others ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with ha@@ em@@ bla@@ stom@@ osis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
survival and tumor progression were studied in five large controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these studies , with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , patients treated with an@@ a@@ emia due to various common malign@@ omas were consistent with significantly higher mortality than with the controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications associated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin patients and at controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ cal events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transmitted to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transferring a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the examined data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels that are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa was the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 . in animal experiments with approximately 20 times of the recommended weekly dose epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced sp@@ her@@ ical body weight to a delay in the Os@@ si@@ fication and to an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these reports are based on vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store ab@@ se@@ amed unique for a period of up to 3 days outside the fridge and not above 25 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with rank rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glued label , so that , if necessary , the measurement of partial quantities is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in treating patients with the above indications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and on the day of the surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 23 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner of the authorisation procedure has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and implemented in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. is operational , before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the drug used in traffic is applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) specified in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan , as well as in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan given in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. , is oblig@@ ated to carry out the Risk Management Plan adopted by the CH@@ MP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time as the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline on Risk Management Systems for human use . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • For obtaining new information that may have influence on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • In a month before your treatment , you have suffered a heart attack or stroke - if you suffer from inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or increased chest pain ) - the risk of blood cl@@ ots occurring in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) has occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you suffer from severe bleeding disturbances of the heart ( coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) or brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) or have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during treatment with se@@ amed amed , it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of plat@@ el@@ ets , which res@@ umes after further treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , your doctor will perform regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; iron deficiency , dissolution of the red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated before the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with se@@ amed amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed by injection must be given into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a high hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels , and the risk of death can be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are elevated or rising in potassium , your doctor may consider an interruption of the treatment with se@@ amed ton@@ amed until the potassium values are back in normal range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or con@@ ges@@ tion by insufficient heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adapt your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose to keep the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed acts as a growth factor for blood cells and may neg@@ atively affect the tumor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a larger orthop@@ edic operation , you should investigate the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia before treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and be treated accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not obtain Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after the surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines / applied / applied recently , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( funds to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to establish the immune system ( e.g. for cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how your an@@ emia ( an@@ emia ) refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your doctor will be able to prescri@@ be regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and does not exceed your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you are well set , you get regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread on two equally large injec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your doctor will need regular blood tests to verify the success of your treatment and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia is addressing the treatment , the dose can be adjusted every four weeks until the state is under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure and ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor will conduct regular blood tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time prior to surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before the surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , you can learn when your doctor is appropriate for it , also learn how to sp@@ lash out ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart , heart attack , brain bleeding , stroke , temporary circul@@ atory disorders , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eye li@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke @-@ Ö@@ dem ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat feeling and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ end@@ ie means that there are no longer enough red blood cells to be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section called &quot; Speci@@ fic caution in the application of Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after repeated blood donations , it can occur - regardless of the treatment with se@@ amed - to a blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of blood pro@@ p after the operation ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your initial ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed are significantly impaired or if you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a sy@@ ringe is taken out of the refrigerator and has reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered a lower trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as in case of falling ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additionally , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should have a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after use of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after in@@ fusion such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ et@@ a , a part of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years was investigated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was investigated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two trials involving a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the serum ( an enzyme that builds the bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood , or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study of older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most side effects of A@@ cla@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion , and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ cla@@ sta must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to flu@@ oric acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , or any of the ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cla@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion spot and oste@@ o@@ ec@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cla@@ sta provides inform@@ ational material for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as a similar material for patients where the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the placing of A@@ cla@@ sta across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • The package supplement • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When applying to medical or nursing care &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the correction of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta , a long re@@ mission was observed in patients receiving treatment ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. is recommended prior to the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , may be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after use by A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A can adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children and young people A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and young people under the age of 18 , as data is lacking for safety and efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with A@@ cla@@ sta prior to the treatment of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia is able to develop over the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be induced before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who need dental access , no data is available whether the interruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after A@@ cla@@ sta administration may be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after use of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of un@@ reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation in patients receiving A@@ cla@@ sta was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT ) H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid was associated with ren@@ al function disorders , which expressed itself as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases referred to as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited ren@@ al function were comparable between the A@@ cla@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels were observed in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local reactions After the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in a large clinical study was reported via local reactions to the in@@ fusion spot , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been treated , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ o@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extra@@ ctions or other dental interven@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 study involving 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ ec@@ sis in the jaw area of one with A@@ cla@@ sta and in patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of over@@ dosage , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be obtained by applying oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical efficacy in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was demonstrated with either one bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the fem@@ oral contrac@@ ture ( BM@@ D ) and at least two mild or a medium @-@ heavy existing spine frac@@ ture ( BM@@ D ) .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta were significantly lowered over a period of three years and after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years which resulted in a reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI ( 17 % to 58 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ rates , hips and dist@@ al radi@@ us compared with placebo @-@ treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 % increase in bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip at 6.@@ 0 % , the fem@@ oral neck by 5.2 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bone hist@@ ology of 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the pel@@ vic ridge a year after the third annual dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume in A@@ cla@@ sta compared to placebo .
bone turnover marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) in serum and beta @-@ C Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in serum and beta @-@ C Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) were measured in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients during periods of study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cla@@ sta significantly reduced 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the starting value for up to 36 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months , and was held at 52 % below the starting value for up to 36 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months , and was kept at 55 % below the starting value for up to 36 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall s@@ ini@@ ster mortality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , A@@ cla@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D on the overall th@@ igh and fem@@ oral neck at all times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ cla@@ sta treatment performed more than 24 months compared to placebo , increasing BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % on the overall hip and 4.3 % on the fem@@ oral neck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the once yearly administration of A@@ cla@@ sta was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the starting value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cla@@ sta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed ( medium serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ ples of the age @-@ specific upper normal value when entering the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of ci@@ ch@@ ed@@ ron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron once a day was proven in two six months of comparison studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 6 months , the combined results showed a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influence compared to the bas@@ eline for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients who were classified as Respon@@ ds at the end of the 6 @-@ month trial , were able to be included in a follow @-@ up phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the 143 with A@@ cla@@ sta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study the therapeutic response at 141 of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta was maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of flu@@ oric acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be a dose independent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long period of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose in the urine occurs while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total @-@ body @-@ clearing amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease in zinc @-@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration versus time ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduced clearing of met@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely to be met@@ abo@@ lized in humans , because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing with 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function disorder , down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for severe kidney function problems ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest intraven@@ ous single dose for intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for studies in dogs single doses of 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al tolerance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in rats was determined in 3 @-@ day in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to AU@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use with accumulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Metap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a findings that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , antioxid@@ ant effect of the substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at rats one observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skeleton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage period according to the preparation and conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women who use oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially o@@ est@@ ro@@ gens being formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone structure takes place too quickly , and new bone material is un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ cla@@ sta helps to norm@@ alize the bone structure again , ensuring a normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forces the bone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are in denti@@ stry or undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if you are taking other medicines / applied / applied recently , even if they are not prescription pharmaceuticals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking medicines that is known to the kidneys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta , together with foods and drinks , worry that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you should take sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you recently broke the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since A@@ cla@@ sta has a long time , you may need a further dose after one year or longer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to follow these instructions carefully , so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in your blood after the in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cla@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if missed by A@@ cla@@ sta , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before ending the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta If you are considering the termination of treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please take your next medical appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after subsequent in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; physical signs because of low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling sensation or num@@ b@@ ness , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

persistent pains and / or non @-@ healing wounds in the mouth or in the jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the side effects listed will affect you significantly or you may notice any side effects not listed in this information information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions to the application ; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , it is recommended to make the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is especially important for patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia can develop , which usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. is recommended before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need more information about your illness or their treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A is used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or about it or • which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or more I
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , four studies have been conducted to over 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting up smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the studies on the attitudes of smoking did not show uniform results so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A was difficult to assess in this area of use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A ? the most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A observed during the studies ( observed at more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , since it can increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among others in a small minority of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
caution is recommended while using A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicine against fung@@ al infections ) and k@@ eli@@ er@@ y@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to diet and exercise to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or obes@@ e patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors , such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , due to the lack of data on efficacy and harm@@ lessness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depression or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms have been reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients receiving the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used , unless the use of treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in patients who have no noticeable risks in addition to obesity , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period prior to mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycl@@ ine disrup@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposition with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behaviour or memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Auth@@ oring Report ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Committee for Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the trials conducted in order to reach recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) when met@@ form@@ in ( a diab@@ etic drug ) can be used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted using met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ n@@ ant or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the acet@@ one treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops , which makes type 2 diabetes more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of acet@@ one was studied in tri@@ ple@@ otherapy , in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the trial study , the effect of an additional administration with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ filler was reduced by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a small study , in which the combination of acet@@ yl@@ and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients receiving an additional insulin decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased from 0.@@ 69 % to 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving additional placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor to patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - in the blood ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was decided that in the context of a mon@@ otherapy , Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for placing Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients less than 18 years old no data is available , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest dose and gradually increase the dose gradually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain and ede@@ ma if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a cardiovascular out@@ come study involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this study showed an increase in the incidence of heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with elevated output liver cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should not be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the AL@@ T levels are elevated up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver cells are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ n , liver enzymes are to be examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , should be directed to the laboratory parameters of clinical evaluation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was demonstrated that can stir from fatty deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a minor reduction of mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two or three @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the market launch was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , about an occurrence or worsen@@ ing of diab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acuity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the ing@@ es@@ tion of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescription physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients talk about disturbances of visual acuity ; an appropriate ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a summary analysis of un@@ desirable events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated fac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medi@@ tate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures in patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , treatment is to be reduced ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interactions with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ lized by these enzymes , such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( from available data ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lead to a temporary alteration of the tur@@ g@@ or and refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as it can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T asc@@ ents beyond the quad@@ ru@@ ple of the upper limit of the normal range were often similar to placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under Met@@ a or Sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or respectively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the market launch has rarely been reported about heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , but more often when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a summary analysis of un@@ desirable events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients were performed in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on were compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medi@@ tate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days there were no symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver , and increases the peripheral glucose analysis in the event of insulin resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ von@@ ic as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of two years after the onset of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in 69 % of patients treated under G@@ lic@@ la@@ von@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin for three months was random@@ ised to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin . a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents proved to be statisti@@ cally significant in comparison to the bas@@ eline values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diab@@ etics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most clinical trials compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol as well as a minor but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol level were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced total plasma levels and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ von@@ ic reduced values have been observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the in@@ timi@@ dation tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ erior increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardi@@ oc@@ cult outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease in groups were random@@ ised to receive either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after oral use , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is quickly absorbed , whereby the top concentrations of un@@ changeable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on can usually be achieved 2 hours after application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after oral use of radio@@ actively marked Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in humans , the marker was found mainly in the wood ( 55 % ) and at a lower extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mean plasma @-@ elimination of imm@@ ac@@ ulate Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabolism is 16 @-@ 23 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower than in healthy subjects in patients with impaired ren@@ al function , whereas the rates of oral clearing of the parent substance are similar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in toxic@@ ological studies mice , rats , dogs and monkeys comp@@ lied with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible external hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ insul@@ in- and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ureth@@ ral epitheli@@ um was induced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an animal model of the family @-@ aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of col@@ oni@@ um tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated fac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medi@@ tate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures in patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a further study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ von@@ ic were examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents proved to be statisti@@ cally significant compared to the bas@@ eline values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the in@@ timi@@ dation tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ erior increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , which has an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin and type 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study measured the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which indicated that blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acet@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients , possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , doses of acet@@ ph@@ ane need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package supplement ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weighed in the treatment of diabetes , compared to the risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a licence for placing Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day , when a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds , to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can be observed in the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast @-@ acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( cell insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA versus insulin in animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a dose adjustment is required when changing to acet@@ ph@@ ane , it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can lead to that insulin and meals must be used or taken at other times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the doctor must consider possible interactions during the therapy and ask his patients to ask for other medications taken by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 B@@ less hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in inadequate controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias may lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es , and may end with temporary or permanent disturbances of brain function and even death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diab@@ etics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum efficiency is reached within 2 to 8 hours and total duration of operation is up to 24 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human insul@@ ine molecule have been taken into consideration ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not allow specific dangers to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to increase the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before using the manual for the first use , according to the manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the doctor must consider possible interactions during the therapy and ask his patients to ask for other medications taken by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check a set dose • Record the number on the closing cap next to the metering stamp • Record the highest number you have set on the button scale • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the closing cap forward or backward until you have set the correct number of units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , insulin from the injection needle will leak out and the inserted dose will not be correct • If you have tried to stop a dose of more than 78 units , follow these steps : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then remove the closing cap and set it up again , that the 0 of the metering stamp is opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if air bubbles are present , these will be collected at the top of the cartridge • While the injection needle continues to keep up , press the button in the direction of the arrow ( Fig@@ ure C ) • At the point of the injection needle a drop of insulin is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • Place the closing cap back to the finished pen , that the digit 0 is opposite the metering stamp ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Check if the push button is pressed completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the push button can not move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the closing cap indicates 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the push button moves outward while you rotate the closing cap • The scale below the push button ( button scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 107 • Note the highest number you can see on the button scale • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the recommended dose , if you have set a wrong dose , turn the cap forward or backward until you have set the correct number of units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn it until the push button is at the bottom and you feel a resistance , then take the closing cap and set it up again that the 0 of the metering stamp is opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful not to press the pressure button during the injection , until you pressed the button after the injection until the injection needle was pulled out of the skin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may not be accurate , you can &apos;t use a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge , but you can &apos;t use the residual quantity scale to estimate how much insulin is still remaining , but you can &apos;t use it to set or select your dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dose can be corrected both upwards and down@@ wards , by turning the can pre @-@ selection button in the appropriate direction until the correct dose is compared to the dose indicator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or arthritis ( &quot; stones &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first treatment months there are still some cases of g@@ out , so it is recommended that patients continue to use A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic for at least 6 months to prevent g@@ out attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drug is not recommended in children and for patients who had an organ transplantation , as it was not examined for these groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study , involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to that of a placebo ( bog@@ us medicine ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic leu@@ k@@ emia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second study , two doses of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients , whose acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients receiving A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) received a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 13@@ 4 patients under placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may also be increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective in lowering the urine acid levels in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic hyper@@ ur@@ an@@ a@@ emia in diseases which have already led to urine deposits ( including one of the medical records known or currently present , and / or arthritis ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the serum concentrations exceed 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe kidney function restrictions , efficacy and safety have not been fully studied ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children and young people Sin@@ ce there is no experience in children and adolescents , the use of f@@ ebru@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there is no experience in organ tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other har@@ n@@ essing drugs , it can occur during the treatment beginning with acute toxic@@ ity , because the lowering of serum concentration in tissues can initially be mobil@@ ised in tissues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine can increase so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during Phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning of filing and subsequent clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in zinc has not been carried out at f@@ ebru@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ory can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ ic level ( a inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at subjects the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times daily with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % and AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical studies , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a can adjustment for f@@ ebru@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
in a study involving subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily amounts to an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Sub@@ strate which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of f@@ ebru@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ant@@ acids There has been shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids , the magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include side effects of f@@ ebru@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events was observed in the total f@@ ebru@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ dia compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the Pi@@ vot@@ al Study of Phase 3 ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) .
the risk factors identified in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ clerosis and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) were reported in the treatment groups and reported in all the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diar@@ rhe@@ a ; nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated at the same time with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ ine . * * In clinical studies no serious skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 Off@@ ered long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 90@@ 6 patients were treated up to 1 year , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the events related to long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were either reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 for these doses , either at all or with a lower frequency : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ pur@@ ine @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for in vitro inhibit@@ ing , which lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic a@@ emia and g@@ out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients , where the last three month levels of serum concentration were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
placebo ( n = 13@@ 4 ) to AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) or AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 13@@ 4 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ mental value at the beginning of studies of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x a day compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x a day compared to the conventional used dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum samples &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 times daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were sum@@ mar@@ ised for analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ; # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the lowering of serum acid levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit visit in week 2 and continued throughout the entire treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily , 10 patients with serum incre@@ ment &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
primary end@@ point in the group of patients with kidney function restrictions The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x a day ) of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decline of serum concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data collected in phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 required a treatment against rheum@@ atism ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against feeding ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was associated with a reduction in the size of the pack , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the gi@@ g@@ ties up to month 24 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and in patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased simply and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose proportional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for doses between 120@@ mg and 300 mg , an increase in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum concentration of serum ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of f@@ ebru@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary attachment to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width obtained with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ en showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are made predominantly by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked f@@ ebru@@ x@@ ost@@ at around 49 % of the dose in the urine found itself as imm@@ utable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) with known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as imm@@ utable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 1 % ) , known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild or moderate or severe kidney failure the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal ren@@ al function .
the average total AU@@ C of f@@ ebru@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 @-@ times of 7.5 μ &#91; 0.2 g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh classification B ) Li@@ ver dysfunction the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not change significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes to the AU@@ C of f@@ ebru@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility in male rats was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ d@@ osed group , in approximately 11 @-@ times of exposure to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine compound , and considered not relevant for clinical use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been noted that f@@ ebru@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in high doses , which were about 4 times of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which was accompanied by a decrease in expenditure and a development delay in the offspring of rats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with expos@@ ures , approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with expos@@ ures , which ex@@ crete about the 13 @-@ fold of human therapeutic exposure showed no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a can adjustment for f@@ ebru@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
diar@@ rhe@@ a ; nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated at the same time with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ ine . * * In clinical studies no serious skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
21 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 90@@ 6 patients were treated up to 1 year in 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients , where the last three month levels of serum concentration were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data collected in phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 required a treatment against rheum@@ atism ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against feeding ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility in male rats was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ d@@ osed group , in approximately 11 @-@ times of exposure to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner of the authorization for placing the drug has to make sure that a drug vig@@ il@@ ance system is described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , and is available for so long as the medicine is brought into circulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline , an updated R@@ MP is prefer@@ able to risk management systems for human medicines with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additionally , an update of the R@@ MP is required , if new information is available , which have an impact on the safety data , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or risk minim@@ ization within 60 days &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations which are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low through the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the formation of crystals is prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is achieved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C must not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive to the active ingredient F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine if you have a heart weakness or suffer from another heart problem . • if you are treated with a high ur@@ inary acid concentration in the result of a cancer or les@@ ch @-@ ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare inn@@ ate disease in which there is too much ur@@ ic acid in the blood ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a check in the moment ( sudden onset of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , feeling of warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the check @-@ in occurs before you begin treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not have to be so , but could also occur with you , especially during the first treatment weeks or - months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines , if necessary , to prevent any injury or to treat the symptoms associated with it ( such as pain and joint swelling ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines / applied / applied recently , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is particularly important to inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking medicine if you are taking medicines with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C ( for the treatment of cancer ) • Az@@ ath@@ i@@ op@@ rine ( for the treatment of cancer ) • T@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for the treatment of heart disease )
there were no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C on the traffic ti@@ ghtness and the ability to operate machinery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , please take AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C only after consultation with your doctor if it is known that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the back of the bli@@ ster pack , the individual week@@ days are printed , so you can check if you have taken a tablet every day . • The tablets need to be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have un@@ intentionally taken an over@@ dose , contact your doctor or emergency room at the nearest hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you forgot to use AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , get it as soon as possible unless the next intake is imminent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you break the intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , your ur@@ inary acid concentration can increase again and your discomfort can wor@@ sen as new urine crystals can form in your joints and kidneys as well as their surroundings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause when there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to avoid irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines which are approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only took Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate income ( 32 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose , which is required to prevent bone loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system like abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , ul@@ cer@@ ation ( ul@@ cer@@ ation ) , batter@@ ed abdom@@ en , diar@@ rhe@@ a , as well as aci@@ dic irritation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may not be used in diseases of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . approval for placing AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cap@@ s@@ ular , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can only be taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following hints must be followed carefully , in order to reduce the risk of adverse reactions and associated side effects ( see paragraph 4.4 ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after getting up the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or melt the tablet in the mouth because a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a is to take place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , can only be given with particular caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al erosion , were rarely reported in patients under the seizure of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( some of them were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the doctor should therefore pay attention to any signs and symptoms that point to possible allergic reactions such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia or pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ viral pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and to get medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 The risk of severe adverse side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or , after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation , continue to take . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no elevated risk was detected ( after market introduction ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and complications ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
oste@@ o@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw - commonly associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ o@@ eli@@ tis ) was reported in cancer patients whose therapeutic regi@@ men predominantly administered intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the treatment of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a max@@ illary surgery , reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clinical assessment by the treating physician is decisive for therapy planning for each patient , based on an individual benefit risk assessment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients need to be instructed that they should take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning , after having noticed their failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was used in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in healthy subjects , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) resulted in no clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 distribution studies on rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance identified within 72 hours with urine was ex@@ cre@@ ted and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ec@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and is therefore not accepted that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; characteristics in patients Pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the portion of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted from the urine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there are no clinical data on it , the elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments is also reduced in patients with reduced ren@@ al function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , in patients with reduced ren@@ al function a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate can be expected in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tablets are available as rectangular , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 270 &quot; on the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , an adult patient is administered to allow kidney transplan@@ ts to be re@@ pul@@ sed by the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant , compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the gra@@ ft was rejected after a period of treatment ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ tran@@ spl@@ ant or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , shorter further studies in 119 patients with kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant and 129 patients were performed with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients may not be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients and doctors must be careful if other ( especially some herbal ) medicines have to be taken at the same time , as the dose or dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow cap@@ e top with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange cap@@ s@@ ular bottom with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; Modification of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close control of a medical device experienced in the tran@@ spl@@ ant ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of a transition to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dose of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases , and on blood @-@ level provisions ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after converting Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley level should be controlled before switching over and over two weeks after conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Day 4 , the systemic exposure measured as a valley mirror , comparable to both kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ ting under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate noc@@ tur@@ nal transition phase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearing , an adjustment of the pre @-@ dose can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral use of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; duration of application To supp@@ ress gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dose recommendations - kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection . oral Adv@@ entur@@ f treatment should start with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further can adjustments may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after transplantation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dose recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ entur@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dosage recommendation - switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ entur@@ f must be converted to a daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , related to the total daily dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ dose of kidney and liver transplantation must begin once a day for the prevention of gra@@ ft rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart tran@@ spl@@ ant At adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other gra@@ ft recipients ob@@ jected to an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with color@@ ec@@ tal tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction in patients with severe liver dysfunction , dosage adjustment in specific patient groups can be necessary for patients with severe liver dysfunction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus it can be assumed that a can adjustment is not necessary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful observation of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cholesterol and a calculation of the urine volume ) is recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f In the conversion of a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases , with the aid of full @-@ blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ c controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to perform common monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley level during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood @-@ level mirrors should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ entur@@ f , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or concur@@ rent use of substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ blood concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since advent is a medicine with a low clearing , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the indications in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the blood level of the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical practice , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and blood transplan@@ ts usually lie within 5 - 20 ng / ml and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has caused serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may result in tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; Modification of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close control of a medical device experienced in the tran@@ spl@@ ant ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ated formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ated formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f available for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients and gra@@ ft recipients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of possible interactions that may lead to lowering the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and weak@@ ening of the clinical effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ ph ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is advisable , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rare cases , a hyper@@ tro@@ phy called cardi@@ omy@@ opathy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin les@@ ions due to suitable clothing or use of sun protection with a high protection factor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if patients suffering from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and blur@@ red vision should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are special caution in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while using substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a strongly pronounced altern@@ ation was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole and I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ema ( z .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies have resulted in the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal degradation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ lized by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can interfere with their metabolism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearing of ster@@ oid Con@@ tri@@ c@@ tiv@@ a and thus increase hormone ex@@ positions , decisions regarding contrac@@ eption can be particularly cautious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplantation patients have no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially for its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ born , i.e. : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often not exactly determined because of the disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side effects following their frequency are outlined in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; isch@@ em@@ ic disorders of the coron@@ ary vessels , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia and cardiac arrest , heart failure , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ opathy , pal@@ pit@@ atio , anom@@ ali@@ es in EC@@ G , abnormal heart rate and heart rate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea , intestinal inflammation , gastro@@ intestinal ul@@ cer and perfor@@ ation , bleeding from the gastro@@ intestinal tract , stom@@ atitis and ul@@ cer@@ ation , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ tic signs and symptoms , ob@@ st@@ p@@ ation , flat@@ ul@@ ence , flat@@ ul@@ ence , signs and symptoms in the gastro@@ intestinal area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases are often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cases of N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was reported via ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms , including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in conjunction with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it is assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level are expected to medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ole protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) that is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular memory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ dal @-@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duc@@ tions in the T cell , preventing tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of the T cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin 2 receptor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
12 confirmed acute re@@ pul@@ ations were 3@@ 2.6 % in the first 24 weeks ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and 29.@@ 3 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patient survival rates after 12 months were at 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f and 9@@ 0,@@ 8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; 25 women , 11 men , and 19 men were killed in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant The efficacy and safety of Adv@@ entur@@ f and Pro@@ gra@@ f was compared in combination with my@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ ate mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , at 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients showed 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ Arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy and safety of Pro@@ gra@@ f , C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared in combination with Basili@@ xi@@ mab @-@ antibody production , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , at 6@@ 38 de nov@@ o kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incidence of treatment failure after 12 months ( defined as death , gra@@ ft loss , biop@@ sy confirmed acute rejection or missing follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the difference in the treatment was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ agra@@ f@@ - C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % ) ) for Adv@@ agra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % ( 5.2 % ) ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in arm 6 ( 3 women , 3 men ) died in the Adv@@ entur@@ f arm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus according to other primary transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has become a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant based on pancre@@ atic and lung and color@@ ec@@ tal transplantation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 175 of treatment transplan@@ ted patients , with 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplantation , and in 6@@ 30 cases treated as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with the observations in the major studies where Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lung transplantation in an interim analysis of a recent multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients receiving either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first year after the tran@@ spl@@ ant , chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was less frequent ( 2.@@ 86 % vs. 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0,@@ 8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was 21.@@ 7 % compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % less than C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,@@ 0@@ 25 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were transferred from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . ; An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % vs. 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % vs. 3@@ 3.3 % ) and after 1 year ( 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ank@@ re@@ ast Plan@@ tation A multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients who were simultaneously receiving a pancre@@ atic and kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant that was random@@ ised to a random@@ ized procedure Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per minutes ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to achieve the desired level mirror of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
bow@@ el transplantation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study involving oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ec@@ tal transplantation demonstrated an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year and 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections such as bone mar@@ row magni@@ fication and additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab in lower initial doses ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ ne et al . ; An@@ n Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) .
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of metabolism in cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearing @-@ rates observed after transplantation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metabol@@ ised before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done through bile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f , for stable patients based on pro@@ gra@@ f ( once a day ) in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to perform common monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley level during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ated formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
28 confirmed acute re@@ pul@@ ations were 3@@ 2.6 % in the first 24 weeks ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and 29.@@ 3 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy and safety of Pro@@ gra@@ f , C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared in combination with Basili@@ xi@@ mab @-@ antibody production , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , at 6@@ 38 de nov@@ o kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

44 confirmed acu@@ pressure was 3@@ 2.6 % in the first 24 weeks in the Advent group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and 29.@@ 3 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy and safety of Pro@@ gra@@ f , C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared in combination with Basili@@ xi@@ mab @-@ antibody production , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , at 6@@ 38 de nov@@ o kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 34 patients were converted from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , while only 6 Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus patients needed another therapy ( B@@ ech@@ stein et al . , Transplan@@ tation 2004 ; 77 : 12@@ 21 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for your doctor to determine the correct dose and adjust it from time to time , he must then perform regular blood tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have taken a larger quantity of lawyers than you should have in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently taken a larger quantity of adv@@ agra@@ ph , seek immediately your doctor or the emergency department of the nearest hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you forgot taking Adv@@ agra@@ f , if you forgot to take the capsules , please take it the same day at the earliest possible date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cancel the intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , the risk of rejection of your tran@@ spl@@ ant may increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ance is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( due to the lack of factor VI@@ II , con@@ genital bleeding disorders ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage and frequency of use depend on whether Adv@@ ance is used to treat bleeding , or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method described as re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was incorporated , which enables the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ance is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently , so that the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under the age of six , the drug was examined for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ance in prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ als was awarded &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ance ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ance may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dosage The dosage and duration of substitution treatment depend on the severity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the place and the extent of bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients below 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impairment are removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients below 6 years ) , until the risk is over for the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during treatment , the dose and frequency of the injec@@ tions are recommended to determine the factor VI@@ II plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in response to factor VI@@ II , individual patients may differ in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value periods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. by factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic interventions must be induced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rate of administration is to be directed at the patient &apos;s condition , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in treating patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II @-@ orientated Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da as@@ say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II @-@ product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ tri@@ angles ) inhibit@@ ors was observed after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II @-@ product to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences concerning the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the AD@@ R@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors of factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ level was observed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period , and both the factor VI@@ II and the clearing rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials involving A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ ory ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition no 53 pap@@ al patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed hard to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a prolonged peak of anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but there were no signs or symptoms that had an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ s gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E was reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a factor factor for the activated factor IX , and acceler@@ ates the formation of activating factor X from factor X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were carried out in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( basic value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters are derived from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data available since initial approval , CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefit risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E &apos;s safety profile which necess@@ it@@ ates filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited officially approved the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company re@@ jects its application for authorisation of the advent of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones , or the soft parts ( tissue , the other structures in the body , surrounds and supports ) are affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a type of virus , which has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified so that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , allowing the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can grow and share . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer appeared in the area of the sub @-@ building , in bones and in the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the CH@@ MP checked the answers from the company to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on examining the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP created a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors has advantages for patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee had further concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in could be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the recovery has consequences for patients , who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altered drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by an allergy to pol@@ len caused inflammation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous membranes ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for adults and adolescents aged 12 , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ ung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be followed by con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms which were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of all hay fever symptoms than the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who took aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease of the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patient showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26@@ ,@@ 7 % in the patients who received the Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , mouth drying , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or one of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( other medicines for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should also not be used in patients who suffer from hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hypertension ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) or hypertension ( hypertension ) or have a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without sh@@ atter or chew@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the lack of data , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of absence ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the duration of the application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after the symptoms are finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as with long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease over time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued when necessary with di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , pap@@ ur@@ id , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , oxy@@ gen@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ i , etc . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been reviewed for this patient study , and the data is not sufficient to address relevant recommendations for dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction , and the data is not sufficient to address relevant recommendations for dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients need to be informed that treating hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythms , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caution : • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hy@@ dati@@ d clu@@ sion or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the am@@ n@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise reduces positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of clinical trials of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test , no significant differences could be found between those treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the safety of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured ; experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor@@ ic properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases , it may result in a di@@ zz@@ lement that may result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with potential let@@ tering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; headache , anxiety , created mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscular tension , euph@@ oria , excitement , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , nausea , vom@@ iting , nausea , vom@@ iting , hyper@@ ton@@ ia or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth drying , pup@@ il stiff@@ ness , and di@@ lat@@ ation , skin comfort , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these include the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 and IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / bas@@ ophi@@ en as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ al@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules P sel@@ ec@@ tin to end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement ranges of the flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective pun@@ ctu@@ ality or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily did not detect an increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ tom@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine response of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine compared to mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine compared to the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cous membrane , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in patients with regard to gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes after the application in the plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the per@@ or@@ tal application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow balance of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached day 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were badly confused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was to exposure to the gift of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the contents of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 the application for authorisation , the Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance System described and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , and its effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tears or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 In particular , it may be particularly sensitive to pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( diabetes ) , a sten@@ odi@@ zing stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer , which leads to a nar@@ rowing of the stomach , the small intest@@ ine or the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a bladder neck closure , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the patient &apos;s history ( breath@@ lessness due to var@@ ic@@ ose of the lung mus@@ cul@@ ature ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform your doctor if under the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze you may experience or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases : • hypertension , pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headache or strengthening existing head@@ aches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when applying in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduces the attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you forgot to take Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the appropriate time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the side effects listed will affect you significantly or you may notice any side effects that are not stated in this information information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart @-@ hunting , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , neck pain , appetite , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , increased physical activity , skin redness , blur@@ red vision , nas@@ al irritation , nas@@ al irritation , pain or difficulty passing urine , it@@ ching , shi@@ vering , anxiety , anxiety and irrit@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing difficulties , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash are reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart hunting , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , nausea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , nausea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , diar@@ rhe@@ a and cases of conspic@@ uous liver functions was also very rarely reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is available as 5 mg tablet and 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ ophi@@ is@@ at ( soluble tablet ) and 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving around 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who had asthma ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efficacy was measured by determining the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the p@@ add@@ les , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and application in children is safe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom score ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the two trials in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of the symptom was 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the treatment of the inhibit@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the previous illness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended for an ongoing treatment during the course of the allergy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol have not increased the performance of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which may lead to impairment of traffic efficiency or the ability to operate machinery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects reported more frequently than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , oral hygiene ( 0,@@ 8 % ) and headache ( 0,@@ 6 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 and IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / bas@@ ophi@@ en as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ hesi@@ ve @-@ molecules P sel@@ ec@@ tin to end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study involving multiple doses , which was administered up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , administered in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement ranges of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective pun@@ ctu@@ ality or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be classified as an alternative to the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as symptoms of 4 or more days per week , and more than 4 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as shown in the overall scores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was representative for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of eti@@ ology , is similar in the different forms and can be random@@ ized to a simple pro@@ spec@@ tus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the history of hist@@ am@@ ines is an caus@@ al factor in all ancient diseases , Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria ap@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka were excluded from the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an improvement of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , where patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) , over 14 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dose study with a total dose of 7.5 m@@ g. meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n reveal no particular dangers to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; color@@ less film ( contains lac@@ tose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hypo@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , light wax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years may be caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are available which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical studies and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , and experience a higher substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup &apos;s safety in children between 2 and 11 years , which can be met@@ abo@@ lized , is identical to that in children who are normally met@@ abo@@ lized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug should not be taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 years of age suffering from anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy have received a daily di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the progression of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses to adults and young people , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which a total dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ ary of the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents reported no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect psych@@ om@@ otor impairment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not result in increasing the impairment of alcohol @-@ induced impairment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as shown in the overall live scores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria ap@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger in black ( 18 % adults ; 16 % children ) than with chew@@ ing ( 2 % adults ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are limited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 3 to 6 hours , the strain ( AU@@ C ) was about 6 times higher and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug con@@ ges@@ tion after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) , over 14 days in adults and adolescents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values were comparable with pedi@@ atric patients in the recommended doses with those of adults who received the Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III brown bottles with child @-@ safe polypropylene closures with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ is@@ at must be taken out without damaging it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets a day than in patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G intervals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses , which was administered up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which the di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily did not detect an increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement ranges of the flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective pun@@ ctu@@ ality or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the si@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not significantly dimin@@ ish any safety profile identified with adult patients .
at the recommended dose A@@ eri@@ us melted tablet turned out to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate to the de@@ composition formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study involving multiple doses used in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spread of this badly met@@ abo@@ lized phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , in conjunction with the dose @-@ fin@@ ite studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in infants aged 6 to 23 months , the most frequently encountered side @-@ effects reported more frequently than placebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an additional study , at a single dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents reported no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company takes its application for authorisation of the A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov per@@ missions for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a special kind of vaccine , which is to protect against a strain of the flu virus , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pan@@ de@@ mic erup@@ ts when a new stem of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because humans have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after receiving the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the parts of the flu virus as &quot; foreign , &quot; and antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the immune system is later able to produce antibodies in contact with a flu virus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , the membrane man@@ ure of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that recognizes the human body as a body foreign ) has been puri@@ fied and used as an integral part of the vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should you participate in a clinical examination and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you would like more information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of EP@@ AR ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , aden@@ ase is indeed available as a solution for intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination was not examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ather@@ os@@ clerosis should only be prescribed if the doctor checked out which anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to be addressed to the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice a day , which are taken with twice a day 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ather@@ ase depends on body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , ather@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ quantity of the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and hence also the development of associated infections and diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drug as@@ gener@@ ase , which was increased with low dose , was compared with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who formerly used prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in viral load after treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the studies with patients who previously had no prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load among 400 copies / ml under A@@ gener@@ a than under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ a was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a also reduced viral load in children , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ant inhibit@@ ors , only very few addressed the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ant inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ a reinforced the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ mer , there was a stronger decrease in the viral load after four weeks than in patients receiving their previous prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ a must not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive to am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ather@@ os@@ clerosis may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are disposed of as ather@@ ase and are health @-@ damaging in high concentrations in the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the restor@@ ative immune system ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ather@@ os@@ clerosis in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the use of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ ron@@ y@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a was originally supposed under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information was presented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited permission to transport A@@ gener@@ ase across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children aged 4 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , A@@ generative Cap@@ sul@@ es should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient , the use of amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r should be performed ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ a capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 When A@@ generative Cap@@ sul@@ es are used without the rein@@ forcing addition of k@@ ron@@ y@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of ather@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice a day ) must be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body@@ weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of ammon@@ ium that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ather@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ ron@@ y@@ avi@@ r or other protein @-@ inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules was reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , patients with severe liver dysfunction are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a must not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic breadth , and also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ ino@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that ather@@ os@@ clerosis or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with ather@@ os@@ clerosis , does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , A@@ generative Cap@@ sul@@ es should be used together with low doses of k@@ ron@@ y@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the information on this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chron@@ ically active hepatitis show increased incidence of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on or other glu@@ co@@ co cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are met@@ abo@@ lized via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase @-@ Hem@@ mer Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 a simultaneous administration of ag@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening adverse events such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ a can be less effective because of dimin@@ ished plasma levels of amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with an amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms especially if there are also low doses of k@@ ron@@ y@@ avi@@ r administered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the potential risk of a toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the A@@ gener@@ a solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in duration 5 , when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ a@@ dis@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the patients had other diseases , to which therapy medications were required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. higher age , and associated with drug addic@@ ts , such as persistent anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ sis occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ a must not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic breadth and also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ p@@ k@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly mixed with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening adverse events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in attempting to balance the lower plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with k@@ ron@@ y@@ avi@@ r , adverse reactions have been observed on the liver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of ammon@@ ium can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient already uses cur@@ rants , the amp@@ het@@ a@@ virus levels are and if possible to check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a can adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increases , whereas k@@ MA@@ x is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) is administered in combination with ammon@@ ium capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , confirming the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment scheme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg , Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , 52 % is degra@@ ded in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ min values of amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were obtained twice a day with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day are administered twice a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a tight monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study used to use ather@@ os@@ ine in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine is recommended , however , due to the ant@@ acids component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and ather@@ os@@ clerosis are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore the application of E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) does not require dosage adjustment .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of N@@ evi@@ dent@@ in on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that N@@ evi@@ ps possibly lowers the serum concentration of am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should these drugs be used at the same time , caution is advisable because Del@@ a@@ virus could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic label . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ dine is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous injection of ammon@@ ium and ri@@ fl@@ ab@@ ec@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and therefore leads to an increase of the side effects associated with ri@@ fl@@ are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , at least half of the recommended dosage will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with ar@@ thro@@ my@@ cin in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simultaneous use of 700 mg of Fos@@ car@@ nit@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r with k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can potentially lead to interactions with ather@@ os@@ clerosis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these drugs , when used in combination with ather@@ os@@ clerosis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as ather@@ ase as it can cause resor@@ ption disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme reduc@@ ers ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ v@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ v@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ v@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simultaneous intake of ather@@ os@@ clerosis can considerably increase its plasma concentrations and strengthen associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ range from 82 to 89 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ co cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , their metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , significant increases in plasma levels can be expected with simultaneous administration of ather@@ os@@ clerosis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this drug is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zing the mirror is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous injection of am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , ather@@ os@@ clerosis may not be used together with the oral m@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same time it is advisable to use ather@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms especially if there are also low doses of k@@ ron@@ y@@ avi@@ r administered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low reliability of historic compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at the moment , as the AM@@ P is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect of an additional dose of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are also recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous administration of ather@@ os@@ clerosis ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefit for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the milk of lac@@ tate rats , amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected ; however , it is not known whether it passes into breast milk by people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ production study of pregnant rats , which was administered by evap@@ oration in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight during follow @-@ up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further development of seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of an ambul@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of ather@@ oma was examined in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , very early and rarely lead to treatment canc@@ erous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether or not they are drugs used to treat ast@@ er@@ ase or other medicines at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the side effects listed below date from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ant inhibit@@ ors were received twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication , were performed in more than 1 % of the patients as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients including a loss of peripheral and retinal fat tissue ; increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue and hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation ( stem cells ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated individuals who had been treated with ammon@@ ia in combination with lam@@ iv@@ u@@ dine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over an average duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stem cells ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and disappeared spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of as@@ he@@ ase twice daily along with low dose k@@ ron@@ y@@ avi@@ r ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degrees 3 and 4 ) were observed very frequently in patients who received ather@@ ase along with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed on signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate the necessary supporting measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process puls@@ ating viral g@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ proteins with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 and CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF ( H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of the HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral retin@@ avi@@ r / k@@ ron@@ y@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ onic inhibit@@ ors with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described above are rarely observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors revealed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ ino@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks with the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V or I@@ 50@@ V or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / V or I@@ 50@@ V / M / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / V / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F /
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analyses of clinical phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be used to interpret the results of a resistance testing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these four genetic patterns associated with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r creates a certain cross resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and quin@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently data on cross resistance between amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients showing a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) and zo@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) and zo@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ates ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , it retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ mer @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within borders which may have adverse effects on subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 in a random@@ ized open study where PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice a day ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) and a standard therapy ( standard of care and SO@@ C ) were obtained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one hundred thre@@ es@@ core and sixty ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one N@@ R@@ TI have been included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / k@@ ron@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks with a non @-@ under@@ cover shaft of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ ble@@ ached gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the studies A@@ gener@@ a was tested twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no low @-@ dose k@@ ron@@ y@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ a should be considered in therapy optimisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of ammon@@ ium with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous dietary intake influences the scale and rate of absorption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of ammon@@ ium from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this change results in a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of ammon@@ ium that is active , probably remains unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the absolute concentration of unt@@ amed ammon@@ ium remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient during the dosing interval varies depending on the total dose concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have to be administered with care if they are given simultaneously with ather@@ os@@ clerosis ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily in@@ toxic@@ ological exposition as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the solution , Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less flexible than the capsules ; therefore , A@@ generative solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a multi @-@ gram basis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , hence the effect of kidney function distur@@ b@@ ance on the elimination of am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r and k@@ ron@@ y@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these treatment schemes show up to Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r plasma levels , comparable to those that are achieved twice daily after a dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ con@@ ular aden@@ omas were present in male animals using the 2.@@ 0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of 1200 mg of am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there was little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeu@@ tical purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse coupling tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of ather@@ os@@ clerosis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days , showed high mortality in both the control animals and the treated animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a systemic plasma exposure which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic doses in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus g@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes have been observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 24 When A@@ generative Cap@@ sul@@ es are used without the rein@@ forcing addition of k@@ ron@@ y@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of ather@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice a day ) must be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body@@ weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of ammon@@ ium that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , patients with severe liver dysfunction are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening adverse events such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in duration 27 , when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ related factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increases , whereas k@@ MA@@ x is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) is administered in combination with ammon@@ ium capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ min values of amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were obtained twice a day with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day are administered twice a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a tight monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ dine is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , at least half of the recommended dosage is recommended to reduce the dosage of ri@@ fl@@ are to at least half of the recommended dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ v@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ v@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ v@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ v@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ range from 82 to 89 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ pun@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefit for the mother compared to possible risks for the fo@@ etus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ production study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the evap@@ oration in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during follow @-@ up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of ather@@ oma was examined in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed on signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate the necessary supporting measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 and CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF ( H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , it retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ mer @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ acy should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the absolute concentration of unt@@ amed ammon@@ ium remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient during the dosing interval varies depending on the total dose concentration in the ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have to be administered with care if they are given simultaneously with ather@@ os@@ clerosis ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of kidney function distur@@ b@@ ance on the elimination of am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r and k@@ ron@@ y@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ con@@ ular aden@@ omas ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ times ( rat ) of the exposure to the human after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cy@@ tic aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there was little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on the human being , both from clinical studies and therapeu@@ tical purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse coupling tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days , showed high mortality in both the control animals and the treated animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the metabol@@ isation paths are not fully mat@@ ured , so that amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children aged 4 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; b@@ oo@@ die &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake was not proven neither in patients treated with PI nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ a capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution to stop ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg of amp@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , as no dose recommendation must be given for the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is not deemed necessary for am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r , an application of ather@@ os@@ clerosis is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ phs , A@@ gener@@ a is contra@@ indicated in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and patients with kidney failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the drug &apos;s metabolism and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening adverse events such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be advised that ather@@ os@@ clerosis or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with ather@@ os@@ clerosis , does not prevent HIV from trans@@ mitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening adverse events such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ather@@ os@@ clerosis should be removed , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ sis occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increases , whereas k@@ MA@@ x is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) is administered in combination with ammon@@ ium capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simultaneous intake of ather@@ os@@ clerosis can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and lead to P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am has significantly higher plasma concentrations according to the oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the potential risk for the human being is not known , because of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ co@@ l cannot be applied during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the milk of lac@@ tate rats , amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected ; however , it is not known whether it passes into breast milk by people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ production study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the evap@@ oration in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during follow @-@ up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of ather@@ oma was examined in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether or not they are drugs used to treat ast@@ er@@ ase or other medicines at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral retin@@ avi@@ r / k@@ ron@@ y@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ onic inhibit@@ ors with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described above are rarely observed .
early departure of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within borders which may have adverse effects on subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ a should be considered in therapy optimisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of ammon@@ ium from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a systemic plasma exposure which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic doses in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus g@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes have been observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

your doctor will normally instruc@@ t you to use ather@@ ase capsules along with low doses Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to reinforce the effect of ather@@ os@@ clerosis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of ather@@ os@@ clerosis is based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor , based on your medical history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above mentioned conditions , or taking any of the above medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your doctor recommends that you are taking A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of k@@ ron@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure you have read the use information on Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before starting the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , no adequate information is available to recommend the use of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with k@@ ron@@ y@@ avi@@ r for strengthening effect in children aged 4 to 12 years or in general in patients less than 50 kg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; When taking as@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines , before you start taking as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may need additional factor VI@@ II to control hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge . − On patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat can occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended that HIV @-@ positive women should not breast@@ feed their children under no circumstances , in order to avoid the transfer of HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traffic ti@@ ghtness and operation of machines There have been no studies on the influence of ather@@ os@@ clerosis on the driving ability , or the ability to operate machinery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are aware of intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s , please take this medicine only after consultation with your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when taking Di@@ dan@@ o , it is advisable that you take this more than an hour before or after A@@ gener@@ a , otherwise the effects of ather@@ os@@ clerosis may be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your doctor decides that the intake of k@@ p@@ k@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will have to take higher doses ( 1200 mg Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

important information on certain other components of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake The solution to intake contains propylene gly@@ co@@ l which can lead to side effects in high doses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ co@@ l can cause a number of side effects including sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and reduction in red blood cells ( see also A@@ gener@@ a must not be taken , special caution when taking a@@ gener@@ a is necessary precau@@ tions ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you forgot the intake of ather@@ ase if you forgot taking as@@ gener@@ ase , take it as soon as you think about it and then continue taking the intake as before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can include fat loss on legs , arms and in the face , fat increase in the abdom@@ en and in other internal organs , breast aug@@ mentation and fat pur@@ ge in the neck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other components are propylene gly@@ co@@ l , acet@@ yl@@ gly@@ co@@ l 400 ) , to@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( T@@ P@@ GS ) , acet@@ yl@@ gly@@ co@@ l 400 ) , sodium chlori@@ de , artificial chew@@ ing min@@ ence , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ ric acid , puri@@ fied water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated with Al@@ dar@@ a for up to 16 weeks . • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas the cream is to be carried out three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to bed@@ time , the cream is dil@@ uted to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared to a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies in which patients were treated for six weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two trials involving a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area the complete recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatments are contra@@ indicated or less appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to continue until all visible feet in the genital or peripheral area have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an interruption in the treatment process described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) , or if an infection is observed in the treatment area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the les@@ ions are not completely healed during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and in the puri@@ fied , infected area of the skin , until the cream is completely dra@@ ined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these patients , there should be an atten@@ uation between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with worsen@@ ing their auto@@ immune disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there should be an absorption in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other studies , in which no daily in@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a circumcision are observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation were observed even under proper application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , no clinical experience is available for the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme following treatment with other kut@@ an treatments in the genital and peripheral areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited data suggest an increased rate of incl@@ ination reductions in HIV positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the p@@ add@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair attachment has not been studied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or the reactions are back after completion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to the severity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the regeneration of the treated skin , the clinical outcome of the therapy may be judged approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as there is currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months of treatment available , other suitable therapy forms should be considered in case of super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs there is no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data from an open clinical trial point out that large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower likel@@ ihood of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis on ey@@ eli@@ ds inside the nose or on the lip area within the lip area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on anatom@@ ical spots outside the face and scal@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the available data on the ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on arms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions normally decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the local skin reactions to the patient cause great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions showed a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ bonding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although neither after one @-@ time topical application quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were obtained , no recommendation can be obtained during the lac@@ tation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most frequently communicated and as probable or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme in connection @-@ related side effects in the trials involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the location of the treatment of the p@@ sal@@ war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the most commonly reported and considered probable , or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in relation to side effects , complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side @-@ side effects reported by 185 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , treated from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial phase III . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these studies , the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in relation to the side effect were a response to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , are listed below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the review plan , clinical evidence shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream often results in local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 30 % ) , ex@@ k@@ ori@@ ation / leaves ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the test plan , the clinical indication predic@@ ts that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream often leads to severe er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , heavy erosion ( 13 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accidental one @-@ time oral recording of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ ony which norm@@ alized after or@@ ally or intraven@@ ous fluids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy is clearly superior to a complete healing of the fet@@ uses in an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 60 % of the patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the patients treated completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 16@@ 1 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during three weeks of use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ions within a connected 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area on the uncomfortable he@@ at@@ skin or face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical recovery after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a rule , pa@@ edi@@ atric patients do not usually arise and were therefore not examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies in children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 ; placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these studies , the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three @-@ week use during 16 weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ter@@ med 0.1 , 0.2 and 1,6 ng / ml in the face ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a four @-@ month study on the current toxic@@ ity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased Mil@@ z weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week , did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not presum@@ ed , a risk for man is to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tum@@ ors performed in the group of mice that were treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can harm other people even if these same symptoms have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you may notice side effects that are not stated in this information information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
● F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts ( con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( sexual organs ) and anus ( after ) ; superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a common and slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it remains untreated , it may lead to de@@ formations , especially in the face - therefore early detection and - treatment is important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people who were exposed to exposure to sunlight during their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used in the face and scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body combat the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma to combat ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or the virus responsible for infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have previously used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar supplements , please inform your doctor before you have problems with your immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of reactions to the treated area , do not use cream as your doctor prescri@@ bes you . o Use the cream with a mild soap and water after applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the reactions are cleared , you can continue the treatment . o inform your doctor if they do not have a normal blood picture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulty can be expected when with@@ drawing the fores@@ kin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) in the vagina ( vagina ) that cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or within the anus ( after ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if other medicines have serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than a treatment cycle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have intercourse with genital war@@ ts in the genital area , the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not previously ) is to be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you apply other medicines or have recently been applied , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breast@@ feed your inf@@ ant during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , as it is not known whether i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od interfer@@ es in breast milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of stroke , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( see specific directions for each application area ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream onto the clean , dry skin area with the feet and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is completely dra@@ ined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men with p@@ add@@ les under the fores@@ kin need to withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area beneath them ( see section 2 , What do you need to consider before using Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apply a sufficient quantity of Al@@ dar@@ a cream for 6 weeks in a row to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common side effects ( with more than 1 out of 10 patients to expect ) side effects ( with less than 1 out of 100 patients to expect ) rare side effects ( with less than 1 out of 1,000 patients expected ) Very rare side effects ( with less than 1 of 10,000 patients expected ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tell your doctor / health care professional or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you feel uncomfortable during the use of Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your skin re@@ acts strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream to wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a humili@@ ated number of blood cells can make you more vulnerable to infection ; it can cause you to create a blue stain faster , or you can cause discomfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed will affect you significantly or you may notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of the patients ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the time , these are easier skin reactions occurring within 2 weeks after the treatment is removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally some patients notice changes at the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , sh@@ ading , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally , some patients suffer from changes at the application location ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , ul@@ cer@@ ation , flus@@ hing and scar@@ ring ) , inflammation of the nose @-@ mu@@ cos@@ a , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , redness , ey@@ eli@@ ds , fever , weakness or shi@@ vers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme substitute therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ kan@@ e , g@@ ags ) are not broken down , thus accum@@ ulating in most organs in the body and damaging them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following non neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , ag@@ grav@@ ated movements , reduced lung volume , heart disease and eye disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or a clinic with rehabilitation equipment , and patients may require appropriate medicines to prevent allergic reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study was primarily examined for the safety of the drug , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by affecting its effect regarding the reduction in G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and regarding the size of the liver ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in children under the age of five Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated had a normal liver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , stomach pain , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common side effects in patients less than five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and shi@@ vers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review every year all new information , which may be known , and if necessary update this summary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , with regard to reactions to the in@@ fusion and development of antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for placing Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme treatment in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in individual stages to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which rehabilitation facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase usually occur within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction have to be treated with care when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of the treatment after a longer interruption , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity after an interruption of the treatment must be handled with caution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti @-@ py@@ ra@@ cti@@ ca ) , to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be induced and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which reaction has occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction has occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 are treated ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used at the same time with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy that include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns originating from lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk is recommended , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in Phase 3 ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms that were observed during the phase @-@ 3- study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
children Un@@ wanted drug interactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 with predominantly severe duration and duration of treatment up to 12 months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the start of the treatment to a ser@@ o@@ kon@@ ogram , whereby it was a ser@@ o@@ kon@@ ogram in patients aged 5 years ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the end of the phase 3 trial ( or until early retirement from the study ) , antibodies demonstrated by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ thal@@ ate ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients , had never come to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was observed .
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro which seemed to imp@@ air the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear related to the incidence of unwanted drug reactions , although the occurrence of unwanted drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the enzyme substitute therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ atum , and the prevention of an additional accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase III study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although patients were random@@ ised to study the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient revealed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V , and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me compared the placebo group to improve lung function and the ability to live in the following table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over this period , the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant and the total lung capacity increased further propor@@ tionally to the size of growing children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly prior to treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was noticed , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) was generally observed in 26 patients ( 58 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with a severe follow @-@ up form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks because of increased g@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group . the younger patients with the moderate follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed whereas the older patients with severe follow @-@ up form had only limited or no progress in cognitive development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a phase 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms dosage schemes were performed on the G@@ AG mirrors in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile for patients aged 5 years was similar to that of older , less severely affected patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time administration , toxic@@ ity in repeated application and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not allow specific dangers to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since no toler@@ ability studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines unless listed under 6.@@ 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided the di@@ lution occurred under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the specified time , the owner of the authorization for the placing on the market has completed the following study program , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report for the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the longer term , this tab will include safety and efficacy information for patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase is found containing certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ kan@@ e ) , either in small amounts before or this enzyme is missing altogether . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are allergic to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , or if an allergic reaction occurred to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase in you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please tell your doctor if you are using drugs that contain Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of reduced al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , including non @-@ prescription medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instructions for handling , di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application ( see information for physicians and medical professionals ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ id @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial ede@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the packaging supplement will be updated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided the di@@ lution occurred under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) , determine the number of di@@ lution bottles to be dil@@ uted according to body weight of the individual patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) and &quot; malign@@ ant &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy as sole therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin B@@ 12 ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of water ) should be given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients whose blood count changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed or reduced or the dose should be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA , preventing the cells to divide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier to use in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients , who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , A@@ lim@@ ta &apos;s effects were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy first , average survival time was 8.@@ 3 months , compared with 7,@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta extended survival time compared to the comparison drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for placing A@@ lim@@ ta in the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a 25 mg / ml solution .
the appropriate volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml more ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer according to previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day after the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for further 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients also need an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose , as well as after each third treatment cycle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood @-@ pattern should be created before each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place under the conditions of for@@ tification of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of previous curing therapy cycles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 Blood supply .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should patients not develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value prior to treatment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 can reduc@@ ti@@ o- or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 , or over 65 years of age , an increased side effect risk is present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 , due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical studies patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min were no dose adjustments necessary which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of less than 45 ml / min was insufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1 @-@ fold the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied specifically in the studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutr@@ alisation of neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a can @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neutr@@ ality , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ab@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was treated with a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be treated with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ - la@@ k@@ tic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with mild to moderate kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ va cy@@ l@@ lic ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all patients intended for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a drainage of the ergometer is recommended for patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ ac@@ ular space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 heavy cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed if this substance was administered in combination with a different cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated vital substances ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised to get advice regarding the sperm conservation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g a day ) can lead to reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is recommended if patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used in high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since no data is available with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long semi @-@ life cycles such as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided at least 2 days before the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - fixed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ in@@ opla@@ sty requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ae .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ alog@@ ous an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , serious birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if mandatory and after careful weighing of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out prior to the commen@@ cement of treatment to obtain advice regarding the closure of the sperm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed goes into breast milk , and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby can not be excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ otheli@@ oma and random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ otheli@@ oma .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was compared with 3 P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherap@@ i@@ ums , except for neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.@@ 3 % ) and an increase in the Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these differences are likely to lead back to differences in patient population as the pha@@ go@@ sis 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal output values of liver function tests .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical studies , patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy , or in combination with other chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics , have been reported ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary analysis of this study was undertaken in the population of all patients , who received the investig@@ ational medication in the arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural otheli@@ oma was demonstrated in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the c@@ is@@ pla@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms were improved by improving lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a reduction of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi@@ center , random@@ ised and open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in Pati@@ ents with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC revealed a medi@@ an survival time of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .

limited data from a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre @-@ treatment with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin compared to 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25@@ ,@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the analysis of the impact of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tumours in doses of 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose are found in urine , within 24 hours of use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the week before using A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and about every 9 weeks ( according to 3 cycles of treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ) , you will also receive an injection of vi@@ - t@@ amin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; very frequently &quot; in this utility information , this means that it was reported by at least 1 of 10 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; frequently &quot; , this means that it was reported by at least 1 out of 100 patients but reported less than 1 out of 10 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; occasional , &quot; this indicates that they have been reported by at least 1 of 1,000 but less than 1 out of 100 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fever or infection ( often ) : if you have a body temperature of 38 ° C or over , swe@@ ating or other signs of infection ( because you may have fewer white blood cells than normal , which is very common ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you feel tired or weak , get fast in breath or look pale ( because you might have less hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in than normal , which is very common ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you detect a bleeding of the g@@ ums , nose or mouth or another bleeding that does not come to a halt , or have a red@@ dish or pink urine or unexpected bru@@ ising ( because you may then have fewer blood plat@@ el@@ ets than normal , which is very common ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
occasional ( occurs at least 1 out of 1000 patients but less than 1 out of 100 patients ) increased pulse rate co@@ litis ( inflammation of the internal lining of the colon that can be associated with bleeding in the intest@@ ines and end@@ endi@@ m ) ede@@ ma ( withdrawal of water into the body tissue that leads to swelling ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without compromising the quality of proofing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in overweight adults with a body measure index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square metre in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients who take all@@ i and after 12 weeks do not have a weight loss , should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not break down some fats in the food , resulting in approximately a quarter of the fats contained with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared to placebo in 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who recorded an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year compared to 2.3 kg compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ d@@ ling , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , flu@@ ff o@@ ily ( winds ) and soft chairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in gra@@ ft patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients from the digestive tract are absorbed ) or ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or nursing mothers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited permission to import Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K into the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with excess weight ( Body @-@ Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a moder@@ ately hypo@@ cal@@ oric or fatty diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and young people under 18 , as there are insufficient data on efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal absorbed , it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or a fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as weight reduction in diabetes may be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting treatment with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diab@@ etic needs to be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients who are all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to take additional pregnant precau@@ tions , in order to prevent possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption in case of serious diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study on drug interactions , and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally norm@@ alized ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the patient should be advised to take an additional vitamin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after receiving a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a small number of healthy volunteers who were at the same time received or@@ list@@ at a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of taken fat is prevented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( frequency based on available data ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incidence of adverse events known after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain magnitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; † It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible , actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days on normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the majority of cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported after the market launch , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on research on humans and animals , a rapid back @-@ formation of any systemic effects can be traced back to the characteristics of or@@ list@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper thin intest@@ ine , the therapeutic effect is performed by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ str@@ ische and p@@ ank@@ re@@ an li@@ pi@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical studies have derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 determine the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was used three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their starting weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the largest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average change in the total pri@@ est@@ ess was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( starting value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( starting value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( starting value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( starting value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist size the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ lized or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general therapeutic doses could not be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of cum@@ ulation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study involving adi@@ p@@ ous patients given the minimal systemic resor@@ bed dose , two major metabol@@ ites were identified , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ Leu@@ cine group ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data has no special risk for man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

BM@@ I helps you determine whether you have a normal weight in relation to your body size or are overweight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if these diseases initially do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should nonetheless ask your doctor for a check examination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for each 2 kg body weight , which you lose weight during a diet , you can lose an additional kil@@ ogram with the help of all@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a meal or does not contain any fat , do not take a capsule . all@@ i can only act when the food contains fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutrition @-@ related accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nutritional supplements are effective because you can understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your eating habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to achieve your goal weight safely , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • In order to reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms ( see Section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember to ask your doctor beforehand , if you are not used to physical activity . • Sta@@ y physically active during the intake and after ending the intake of all@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If you cannot detect any reduction of your weight after twelve weeks of application of all@@ i , ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • In case of a successful weight loss , it is not necessary to change the diet only at short notice and then return to the old habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule after . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the side effects listed will affect you significantly or you may notice any side effects that are not stated in this information information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , as you may have not consistently reduced the fat content in your diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the following basic rules you can learn to minim@@ ise the diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a low @-@ fat diet . learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the probability that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Divi@@ de your recommended amount of fat evenly to the daily meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a nutri@@ tious dessert , as you may experience it in other programs for weight loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not use over 25 ° C to protect the contents from moisture . • The container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel which serve to keep the capsules dry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not swallow them . • You can carry your daily dose every day in the blue transport box ( Shuttle ) , which is included in this package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

excess weight affects your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hypertension • diabetes • heart disease • hypertension • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis speak to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lasting weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find in the packaging of foods . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keep in mind the below tables below . • The recommended intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with every meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which amount is suitable for you , refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories you use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by keeping the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ise weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight approximately 0.5 kg per week without having to develop frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal daily , i.e. through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• For permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat targets and keep them adher@@ ed to . • Sen@@ se is a nutrition journal containing information on calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you eat cal@@ ory and fet@@ al reactions and give guidelines to become physically active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conjunction with a program tailored to your type of weight loss program , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your goal weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al@@ chem@@ otherap@@ ies are used for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional administration of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , because there is not enough information about the effects in this age group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the active ingredient helps to bind a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , which prevents recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three major studies , Alo@@ xi was examined at 1,@@ 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting showed 59 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chemotherapy for nausea and vom@@ iting showed 81 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi ( 15@@ 3 of 18@@ 9 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 19@@ 1 patients ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid given prior to chemotherapy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the large intest@@ ine massage , patients with am@@ nesty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ ag@@ onists , caution is advisable at simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with whom the interval is extended or which tend to be an extension . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tumor activity of the five chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic agents ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ pent@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical trial , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction was observed between a single intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - concentration oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ m , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( di@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , kol@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) did not have a significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiences relating to the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical trials were the most frequent side effects of a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which could at least be associated with Alo@@ xi , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ st@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups showed themselves ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to observe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were conducted , however , due to the large distribution volume a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for al@@ op@@ - over@@ dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies a total of 1.@@ 132 patients received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ grams / m2 of cyclo@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life time 7.@@ 3 hours ) which was given intraven@@ ously at day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who were given intraven@@ ously 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , are summari@@ zed in the following tables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following clinical examinations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the study conducted at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resor@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration , a slow elimination of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average total half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ proportional in the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in patients and cancer patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentrations amounted to 42 ± 34 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; phar@@ is@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that the value measured at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0,@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable to that of 0,@@ 75 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 40 % are eliminated via the kidneys and about 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in vitro studies for metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and to a lesser extent have implic@@ ated I@@ so@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours of urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a single intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ in@@ jek@@ tion , the total body composition was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al membranes are increased and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , reducing the dose is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only by expos@@ ures that are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure indicating a low relevance for clinical use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies pointed out that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans ) , which were given daily over two years led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the holder of this approval for the placing on the market must inform the European Commission about the plans for placing the drug approved as part of this decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative opinion in which the approval of the approval of the hepatitis C drug used for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ on should resemble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug , which is already approved in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease called viral infection ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a micro@@ scopic investigation , the liver tissue indicates damage , and also the values of the liver &apos;s enzyme Glut@@ amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ norm@@ ality can be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is produced by a yeast produced by a gene ( DNA ) , which stimulates the formation of the active ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon submitted data to the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of the optic drug was compared to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study measured how many patients spoke after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment , and 6 months after the treatment was applied to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from this , the test used in the study examines the extent to which the medication is immune response ( i.e. the body produces antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) , not adequately validated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected layers ( cra@@ cking or cutting ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that were demonstr@@ ably or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ ine @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ ma may not work against this type of infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients aged 9 months , but under the age of 18 the skin area may not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all five studies , the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo discussed the treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ unden , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together in Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of both groups of both groups addressed the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these two studies , however , it was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or by infections that were demonstr@@ ably or presumably by MR@@ SA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , is an irritation at the order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections are out@@ weighed against the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approval for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go in the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again , and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or serious local irritation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment must be carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is begun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections , where MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical studies with secondary infected open wounds , the efficacy of retina in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an alternative therapy should be considered , if after 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment there is no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effect of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low plasma concentrations in humans after topical application on sk@@ imp@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition is not to be expected in vi@@ vo ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole elevated the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ us AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on sk@@ imp@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , can adjustments are not considered necessary if topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient regarding a statement regarding the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy when a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is to be preferred by the application of a systemic antibiotic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ates or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / termin@@ ates , the benefits of breast@@ feeding should be weighed for the woman and the benefit of Al@@ tar@@ go therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which used Al@@ tar@@ go , the most frequently reported side effect was irrit@@ ated by the administration , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us fitt@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data suggests that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved , and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer Center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , blocking partial P binding interactions and preventing the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some infectious forms , consultation by experts should be sought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin towards S.@@ Au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of failure to treat S.@@ Au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resor@@ ption In a study of healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on sk@@ imm@@ ed skin for up to 7 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were obtained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sample collection occurred in the days 3 or 4 of the adult patients , before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however the maximum individual systemic absorption on humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 was reduced to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng / h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the retina in@@ ulin IC@@ 50 .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in studies for oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid movements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in @-@ vitro testing on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mouse lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in the rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was neither male nor female rats any signs of reduced fertility at oral dosing of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ imp@@ ed skin ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 @-@ times of estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development sto@@ licity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner of approval for the marketing authorization must ensure that a drug vig@@ il@@ ance system , as presented in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application ( version 6.@@ 2 ) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner of the authorization for the marketing agency comm@@ its itself to perform detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance activities in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan , as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) and all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as described in the CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline on Risk Management Systems for human use , the updated R@@ MP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next periodi@@ c Safety Update Report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area , you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not apply any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it was not explicitly prescribed by your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may not be used in the eyes , mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the o@@ int@@ ment leaves on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment you can cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a gaz@@ ebo , unless your doctor has advised you to cover the surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic cap containing 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminium bag containing 0.5 g o@@ int@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can be stopped from two doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a toxic@@ ity against hepatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix can be given a hepatitis B or B vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defense ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how it can defend itself against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after receiving the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the virus and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the V@@ acc@@ ine Twin V@@ acc@@ ine , which has been approved since 1996 , and has been approved since 1997 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adult and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of one of three doses of existing vacc@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are containing identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective anti @-@ antibody conc@@ entri@@ c one month after the last injection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month gap between the two injec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix took between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective anti @-@ antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protecting Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month interval between the injec@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , fatigue and irrit@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix can not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals s.@@ a. a permit for placing Ambi@@ rix in the entire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ di@@ mm@@ eri@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a loc@@ alisation is desired for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated using the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis A surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody @-@ an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody @-@ an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody values are in the same order as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mono@@ metastatic vacc@@ ines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not yet fully assured if immun@@ ologically competent individuals who have addressed hepatitis C vacc@@ ination may need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in case of no longer demonstr@@ able antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 As for all injec@@ tions , an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after receiving the vaccine should always be available immediately after receiving the vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a faster protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended , containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cases of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system , there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value , so in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines can be necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since intra@@ muscular injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to an optimal vaccine success , these injec@@ tions should be avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders , Ambi@@ rix can however be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously , since it may result in bleeding after intra@@ muscular administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular , az@@ ell@@ ular , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us @-@ R@@ öt@@ el vaccine was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ o@@ deficiency , there is no need for an immune response . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever similar to the frequency observed in previous thi@@ om@@ ery and preserv@@ ative vaccine Formul@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines from Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines ranging from 1 to 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ur@@ eness on a basis of calculation per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis of calculation per person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after receiving Ambi@@ rix , pain was observed at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after receiving a dose of the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix had been vacc@@ inated against pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the frequency of matches was comparable to per volume ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix ) compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects that received the 3 @-@ doses drop @-@ down vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of severe pain and sensitivity was low , comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a comparison study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that with the 3 @-@ doses drop @-@ down vaccine with 3@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix there was a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not pro belt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the portion of vacc@@ ines reported by severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with a combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units de@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials conducted for vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years , the serum levels for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the serum levels for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year olds , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 were used as standard combination vaccine with three doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the rate of ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B was significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix in the month 2 and 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune response , which was achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 @-@ 11 year olds one month after the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ ines obtained either a 2 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ s- A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , demonstrated that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with the refres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ erial , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular perf@@ ect@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us @-@ R@@ öt@@ el vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults , showed similar serum and ser@@ o@@ ze rates similar to the earlier formulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vaccine is to investigate potential foreign particles and / or physically visible changes , both before and after the reset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food@@ borne foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways such as bathing in water polluted by sewage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that might make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you / your child are infected prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix already with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus / is ( although you / your child feel not uncomfortable or sick / feels ) vacc@@ ination may not prevent illness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If your child already has an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an allergic reaction can manifest itself through it@@ ching skin rash or swelling or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If you want to quickly protect against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the normally scheduled date of the second vaccine ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , he will recommend 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective existing hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before ending the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected in people who suffer from severe bleeding disorders under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened because of a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s own defense / or if you / your child are undergoing a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis / sub@@ tract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of those individuals on vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient to see how strong the reaction is to vacc@@ ination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / she / her child are taking further medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated or has been planned or planned in the near future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient on the vaccine and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if another vaccine needs to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , there should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different lim@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; typically , Ambi@@ rix is not given to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) for you / your child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( more than 1 case per 10 linked doses ) : • pain or discomfort on the in@@ stit@@ ch or redness • Mat@@ ernity • irrit@@ ability • headache • loss of appetite , lack of appetite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ ots often ( up to 1 case per 10 linked doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • High fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Ref@@ lec@@ ted , ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal disorders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further side effects reported that the days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 worn doses ) are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these include locally limited or extensive r@@ ashes , which can be it@@ ching or infl@@ ate , swelling of the eye area and face , start@@ ling breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; influ@@ enza @-@ like complaints , including shi@@ vers , muscle and joint pain , var@@ ic@@ ity , di@@ zz@@ iness , mis@@ conception such as ting@@ ling , loss of sensation or movement capability of some parts , strong head@@ aches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , dis@@ ruption of normal brain functions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impotence and inflamm@@ ations of some blood vessels may cause discomfort , loss of appetite , diar@@ rho@@ ea and abdominal pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
23 . inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child will significantly affect you or you may notice any side effects that are not stated in this treatment supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les , and in packs of 50 without need@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the data , which has become known since the initial authorization for the entry , the CH@@ MP advoc@@ ated that the benefit @-@ risk relationship remains positive for Ambi@@ rix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was published only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Am@@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ates can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage following high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ates - split into several single doses to meals - bl@@ ended , mixed with food or via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ y could not be compared to another treatment or with placebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ medicine , i.e. without substance ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ y may also lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , impotence , fluid retention , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , uncomfortable body odor or weight gain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in patients with dis@@ ruption of the ure@@ a cycle , Am@@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ates effectively prevented ammon@@ ia levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ y was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use is indicated in all patients , where a complete enzyme shortage has already been manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ um form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication of the use when hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the daily dose is individually calculated , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early mani@@ um deficiency of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine @-@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , since there is a risk of the development of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium and equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate corresponding to the maximum daily dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure and severe kidney failure and associated clinical conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat on the liver and kidneys occur , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses , and a reduced number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during breast@@ feeding is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ t@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ our top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old to@@ dd@@ ler , with a single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity during an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an active compound , con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be seen with a ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
5 Pati@@ ents with disturbances in the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate taken for each gram will be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the diagnosis is diagnosed early , and the treatment is immediately started in order to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ested and the disease led to death even in the case of treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free analo@@ gues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative methods of nitrogen elimination ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born patients in post @-@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ um form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) treated by hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defici@@ encies are hardly reversible even in the treatment and in some patients another worsen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and his metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to an individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in case of so@@ ber healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis after individual and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an oral dosing of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma was detected in the next morning after ni@@ ghtly fasting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the kidneys within 24 hours , approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no compla@@ ins with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules are either or@@ ally taken ( infants and children , who can not swallow tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l or a nas@@ al probe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early mani@@ um deficiency of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate corresponding to the maximum daily dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when rats were exposed before the phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lization of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , les@@ ions were found in the brain cells of the brain bark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ t@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ our top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be seen with a ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for elimination of excess fat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on investigations about ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disturbances in the ure@@ a cycle , the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate taken for each gram can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; existing neuro@@ logical defici@@ encies are hardly reversible during treatment , and in some patients another worsen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an oral dosing of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ule form , 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the big measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water prior to use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after the consumption of proteins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the lac@@ tation period , you can &apos;t use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine can pass to breast milk and harm your baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , fla@@ ws , fla@@ ws , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have been observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , you immediately contact your doctor or hospital for an appropriate treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you forgot AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changes in blood cells ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , impotence , fluid retention ( swelling ) , rash , indi@@ ges@@ tion , weight gain and anom@@ al@@ ous laboratory values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the side effects listed will affect you significantly or you may notice any side effects that are not stated in this information information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the board and the container , until the specified exp@@ iry date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish colour and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 If a laboratory check is carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS to the same single doses or@@ ally or via a stomach fever ( tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube which is guided through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon Gran@@ ules . • Rem@@ ove a straight edge e.g. a knife edge over the rim of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Rem@@ ove the recommended number of measuring spoon Gran@@ ules from the container .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , e.g. with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( an anom@@ aly measurement value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack , this can contribute to maintaining blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ox in sole administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and A@@ spir@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S was angi@@ ox , with or without the administration of G@@ PI , in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year overall as effective as conventional treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients receiving PCI was angi@@ ox in terms of all indicators as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding where it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ ox should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to bias , other hi@@ pp@@ dine , or any of the other components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox@@ in is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd authorization to transport angi@@ ox throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST ) inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) during an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous pin of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a PCI is carried out in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately before the procedure a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous pin of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous IV in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us gift of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI operation is planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this value ( ACT for 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second pin should be 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully shu@@ ff@@ led before the application and administered as fast intraven@@ ously before the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with moderate kidney function limitation ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ bal@@ ru@@ din against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second pin dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second pin dose should be checked again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with moderate kidney damage which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) which was included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the biop@@ sy @-@ bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with angi@@ ox may be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous application of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against Hi@@ pp@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a disorder of the hem@@ o@@ st@@ as@@ es@@ ystems and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial end@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially if bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if in case of PCI patients under biop@@ sy , most bleeding of arter@@ ial punc@@ tures can occur in patients suffering from a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , whereas the treatment in principle occurs everywhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who are treated with war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ bal@@ row@@ din , monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din can be achieved again prior to treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting from the knowledge of the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic inhibit@@ ors ) , it can be assumed that these drugs increase the risk of bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the combination of bi@@ bal@@ u@@ dine with plat@@ o@@ cy@@ te modul@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are to be checked regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animal experimental studies are insufficient in relation to the effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , degeneration or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din alone ; 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to bio@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe bleeding were significantly less frequently than in the groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ bal@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ U@@ ITY difficult bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in point area , reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with well known blood supply , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ ali@@ zations occurring at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; point positions , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical study involving biop@@ sy in 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported in practice according to comprehensive application and are grouped according to system organ@@ classes in table 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with biop@@ sy must be stopped immediately and the patient is closely mes@@ hed to monitor signs of bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ ox contains bi@@ ob@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic centre and the an@@ ion @-@ binding region of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , irrespective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine is bound in the liquid phase or at the t@@ inn@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the binding of bi@@ fi@@ mb@@ ine to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible because th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in on its part spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , bi@@ bal@@ u@@ dine with serum from patients with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) was not induced to indu@@ ce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in healthy subjects and in patients , bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect that is evi@@ den@@ ced by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a PCI was carried out following the patient , an additional pin of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg is given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or el@@ ox@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or PCI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients receiving angi@@ ography within 72 hours were spread evenly across the 3 treatment arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the primary analysis and results from the AC@@ U@@ ITY study for the 30 @-@ tau and the 1 year end@@ point for the total population ( IT@@ T ) and for patients receiving aspir@@ in and clo@@ pi@@ do@@ gre@@ l according to protocol ( before angi@@ ography or before the PCI ) are presented in tables 7 and 8 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study involving over 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are presented in Table 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients receiving a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , and in patients with AC@@ S . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is expected that bio@@ degra@@ d@@ din as pe@@ p@@ tide has a cat@@ abol@@ ism in its amino acid components with subsequent recycling of amino acids in the body pool .
the primary met@@ abo@@ lic resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ termin@@ ale sequence by Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to the loss of his aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with normal ren@@ al function , elimination is performed first order with a termin@@ ale half @-@ life of 25 ± 12 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
toxic@@ ity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks at an exposure to 10 @-@ fa@@ ec@@ es of the clinical ste@@ ady state plasma concentration ) limited to anti @-@ shooting pharmac@@ ological effects .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or upper arm or as a permanent in@@ fusion with a insulin pump is administered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood , or the insulin can not be processed effectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine differs very slightly from human@@ oid , and the change means that it works faster and shorter active duration than a short @-@ effective human insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin for patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in type 2 diabetes , with which the body can not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined in comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lis@@ ses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin , or any of the ingredients that are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a permit for placing A@@ pi@@ dra in the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the abdominal wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to reduced glucose tolerance and reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin need for patients with a restriction of liver function can be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any change of action , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production may change the need for insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 A inadequate dosage or abor@@ tion of treatment , particularly in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision , and may require a change of dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used , and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oral anti@@ diab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme , meth@@ ot@@ ens@@ in , chlor@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phen@@ ol , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phen@@ ols and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics are among the substances that can enhance the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , under the effect of Symp@@ athy such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reserves the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ balance can be weakened or absent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between intra@@ embry@@ onic and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not known whether insulin secre@@ tes into human breast milk , but generally insulin is neither absorbed into the breast milk nor is it absorbed after oral use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 100 ; &lt; 1 / 100 ; &lt; 1 / 100 ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cold wel@@ d@@ iness , cool and pale skin , ti@@ redness , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual creation or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is neglected to continuously change the injection unit within the injection unit , as a result , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur at the injection site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by a given person or intraven@@ ous glucose from glucose by a doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after glu@@ ing , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the serious hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose ( especially skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be from insulin g@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effectiveness occurs faster and the duration of operation is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ ic normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type @-@ 1 diabetes m@@ - tus insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0.@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional impact of the glu@@ cos@@ ech@@ ing effect as well as human@@ oid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast acting as normal human insulin , and achieves the total glu@@ cos@@ ech@@ end effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post @-@ den@@ dal gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved just like with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal was taken , a better post @-@ den@@ thal control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ cem@@ ic control , like in human normal insulin , will be given before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before the start of the meal ) before starting the meal ( figure 1A ) and in comparison to human normal insulin that was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
is@@ lan@@ is@@ in in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human standard mal@@ ine which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
