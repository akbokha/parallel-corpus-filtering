&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to translate the module website , you will find in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras website . select from the drop @-@ down list the original and target language of the translation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated at the location of the whole &amp; URL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , Bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated to the Bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can insert texts to translate text directly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions , please refer to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select Settings Exten@@ sions ... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a list of default settings from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system if you have installed additional software .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras crash . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crash@@ es if available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can reach the view filter ( also called Fol@@ der Fil@@ ters ) in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , menu bar under Extras View filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; s current working directory in different ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system .
Tree @-@ Maps allows the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder . this allows large files even then easily detected if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display represents a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color of a rect@@ angle switched over View color mode can represent either depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the mapping of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the respective file or folder . for each feature , you can determine if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View mode , this target is not always maintained . note that less space is lost for setting entries when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to divide the surface of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here it is possible for the labelling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames always advanta@@ ge@@ ously split the surfaces that are as square . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , it was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get that was developed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can find the Picture Gallery in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras Picture Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you visit the Picture Gallery module , you can open a dialog with which you can define the appearance of the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a text input field , the option of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images per line have a slider and a field of rotation , to specify the number of mini images each line in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the check box fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , specify if the file names are displayed under the icons in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; view the file size of the image , see if the file size is displayed under the icons in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the image size check box , specify whether the size of images is displayed under the icons in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change browser identi@@ fier , add a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; add the browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the standard browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Moz@@ illa / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) . if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser you change the browser recognition in one of the following options .
change the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject access with browsers based on Moz@@ illa . you need for example the M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pages that do not match the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes , are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of this out@@ dated browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , the browser identi@@ fier is used for all pages of the website you are currently viewing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the menu entry , set up ... you can set the volume of information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and digi@@ ti@@ ze your photos directly . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; includes quick image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view and comment on your photos . editing features can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it was easy to use , dozens of professional skills are available . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit colour space and all available modules support raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; improved database with significantly more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens , which can be searched for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of the end user . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you are in the program , your web browser will pop up a page in the error report system . all the information you need is entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ cam ; is a project supported by a community . that means that the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam . you can ask questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . in this mailing list you can ask questions to other users .
you can also attend the digi@@ kam homepage to get news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best start to participate and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to participate , registration is included in the developer mailing list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon to select a folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your machine . here , the data logger is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; edited ; you will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ Library . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not take photos as symbols . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can setup &amp; digi@@ plug your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use my albums and my key@@ word@@ lists to manage your photos in the albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it can also handle it . support is based on li@@ bra@@ w library . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to set up this and work with raw files , is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Pre@@ ferences and Ro@@ h work@@ flows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and digi@@ ti@@ ze your photos directly . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of compact &amp; flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera will be connected to the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras supporting an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old digital cameras are using the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read the preview images of digi@@ c@@ am . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most beautiful things to be done , is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ cam ; to create K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full@@ screen mode using F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can disc@@ ard and disc@@ ard pictures anywhere : you can disc@@ ard a picture in another part of the legacy tree , using the horizontal divi@@ der line or another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be dropped into keywords , date list or search . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : J@@ PEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vi@@ es and Audio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the filter on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if it is displayed in the symbol view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view to your photo albums . all photos that were stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also add a screen@@ shot to an album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it down . you can copy or copy several photos in the same way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an album contains a collection of photos and album properties to give you information about this collection . to access the album properties , you need to click on the album and edit album properties in the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album collection : are a method to select your albums , so that you can sort them under a common name . when you want to add or delete albums from the tool@@ bar , you can do this in the collections for collections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums , sort by date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buttons el@@ dest , average , new ester : these set the date on the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you first opened an album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is meant to help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you probably want to select another photo as a symbol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and select it in the pop @-@ up menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an album can only be included in a collection , and collections cannot be ne@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ cam ; supports entering keywords for individual photos in the section of my keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures will be displayed in this album in the image window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you open an album for the first time , you must wait for a while while the preview pictures are generated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information about each image is displayed below the preview pane . which information these are , you can change the panel settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preview pictures feature help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse poin@@ ter a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the key features of a photo . the screen shot above in the introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photos and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing shows your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to this . you can choose from the context menu of preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between viewing the images , slide show or editing the images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can open the image processing with a photo by either editing F@@ 4 Image Edi@@ ting ... or edited the contex@@ tual menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... in the panel editing pane .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the sub @-@ menu of opening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some programs do not store this data when you store the modified image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select turning . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the file name of a photo , you can use the right mouse button on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to remove a photo from &amp; digi@@ plug , it will move into the tr@@ ash bin from &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 Image dele@@ tion or discharge if you rather want to delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ eli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available the date of the last change of the file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photos with keywords provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalo@@ gu@@ ise your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a keyword is assigned to a photo the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a keyword is selected , all the photos that were marked with this keyword will appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree , allowing you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also easily find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ ste@@ quot ; you can easily find the key words you are looking for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned cue in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for J@@ PEG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; or click on an existing keyword and then select a new keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the sub@@ stit@@ ch of this keyword . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photograph itself will not be deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the position of a keyword , drag it to the desired position in the tree and disc@@ ard it . then a menu will appear which gives you the option to move . a keyword may be at a time only once in the tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can change the properties of a keyword using the right mouse button and select the keyword in the contex@@ tual menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and select the Album in the pop @-@ up menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you select with a keyword , you can click on the keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; you can also click on the right mouse button on the preview pictures and select from the contex@@ tual menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select a photo with any number of tags . the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords to be assigned to it . in this way , you can forgive a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where it was made , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this is displayed under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select a keyword , in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select from the contents menu Rem@@ ove from the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram to select a time frame , which displays all associated images in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this then appears in the list below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cover all the elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and more in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the search box is a small lamp that becomes green when the search finds hits . if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all images are displayed again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tabs on the left side panel with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you can open this you will find a simple search box as described above . you can search this search here as a live search that has always filtered what you typ@@ ed as a search criterion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the results will be displayed in My Search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you will need to select the appropriate entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select Edit , the form will appear to enter the search again with the search information entered . if you select as advanced search , you will find more rules for the search . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select from the context menu search . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam s database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database . each option can be added to the search group or deleted from it . each option can be associated with others about the logical operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tization : character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique called hair @-@ algorithm . this allows images to be compared by comparing these signatures . the lower the difference between two image signatures ; the more they correspond to it . this technique is applied in three areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar picture . if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of in@@ accurate search in the left side bar , it will open and you can drop it there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sketch : free hand paint scheme : draw a quick sketch and digi@@ plug ; find the matching pictures .
this tab provides an intuitive map scanning tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out and move it . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for subsequent use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ cache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window , with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The lumin@@ aire from the contex@@ tual menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and open the main window .
from the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another mode is better suited to quickly extract from a picture series . if you use pairs of pairs navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically displayed in the right area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the normal delete operations also work directly from the illuminated table , such as F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the lumin@@ aire . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data , for example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in pan function , which you can click on the crossed arrows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . just use the zoom controller beneath the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken to final output and permanent storage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your images , protect and use your images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , ass@@ ures , sel@@ ects , conf@@ ec@@ tioned , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exported contents which have a monetary or cultural value . quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is according to your definition data that provide information about or provide a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I dare to say if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not need to know how many photos you have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you will have to decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive sometime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found on your location . the remaining photos will be organized several times on the same location . if you make enough pictures , then you will be able to download sub @-@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of images on different subjects and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archive and 5 % work files will be and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what kind of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also recommend to save metadata in the metadata creation page ; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos during further work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now let &apos;s talk with keywords , keywords , as you often use in other programs , or continue using categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then the tree can be built for you or you can easily move the tree to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enough of the keywords , the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to share your photos simply , you want to share it with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it more closely , then start to see some details , people , the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and now I &apos;m telling you that the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream of having associations , you may even hear the silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for others looking at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him about the motive that she has moved to understand what you understand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength just to work with a label for itself alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can even put a spell chec@@ ker at your disposal . if you export your images in web @-@ galleries , then these labels will be exported to your wishes in the let@@ tering and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it earth not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? good because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is already running with light speed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can easily export your trip to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with Google Earth Viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a p@@ un with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions so also for the work of others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following description will tell you what information was provided in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam , as information should be stored : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and writer ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this field contains the work description of the photographer . examples can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the bi@@ dder field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique for each image , and will be digi@@ ti@@ zed in the near future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; topics : disk faults , disk failure , power sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper or neg@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality that last longer , get harder and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and keep them in the right way . so the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control hum@@ ming . despite this massive protection they are used by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but it is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and therefore almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that this media can read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your manufacturer &apos;s prescription covers a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : discourse study &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT is the most common error reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while most electrical devices do not make a lot of power , devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed spro@@ ckets are different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these can cause serious damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common protection against current peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug bar . remember , not every plug bar also contains a over@@ voltage protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since an over@@ voltage can be used to your computer , you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a wear@@ able over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and you also have the protection for the modem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . some models allow them to even continue working until the current is running . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before you go on holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a backup destination for your software . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are in comparison to the hard drives at home , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) and Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are stored on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t get your pictures in full resolution online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs , at least provide data integrity between operating system and hard disk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the worst part is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not if this happened in your hardware . it is quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors at a lower level . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms using Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is still not part of the kernel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the loss of data in the not@@ ebook , and 46 % in the work@@ station systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
digital cameras sensors are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras move towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive is currently responsible for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . therefore , make sure your data is affected by a data loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suppose you make your backup every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash struck you have luck if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot . forget an airplane accident : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for data loss despite safegu@@ arding the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save it one day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snapshot without history , and represents a complete copy at a time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup , and the last difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer , on a DVD or other optical media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; topics : metadata , IP@@ TC data stored in the image file , retain memory , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ finding images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , screens ... , using the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood and adol@@ escence , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to look at everything what is said today with caution and re@@ assess as time passes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this question should be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards , which are supported by many applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size , actually increasing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s assume that you have set up the scal@@ ability and the area you want to expand to a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and store it onto a new disk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check with the d@@ mes@@ g command if your new disk was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # change the size of the drive if needed
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary patented format that disappears slowly from the market , so you should not use it any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ NG is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is able to store gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color allocation on hetero@@ geneous platforms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to use metadata .
this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace Adobe &apos;s XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; imaging technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; a mix of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ sp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many photographers draw it in front of an original of your recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . therefore , you should think about whether you use D@@ NG as container and put everything together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ C@@ MI @-@ communities and the D@@ C@@ MI @-@ working groups include yearly conferences and workshops such as standard connections and educational efforts to reach a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for fine @-@ format@@ ting editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ code , then you should add metadata again . these have been cut off by the other programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them into web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam . in section Ad@@ ding a photos to an album you can add a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard disk . but the camera interface provides you many advanced settings to import images to your al@@ disk data base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze your digital camera , connect it to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on . for more information , see the manual of your camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . some cameras may take a while . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol are displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information about each entry . using the page features properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this dialog displays file characteristics and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol shows that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that not all information is available at some digital cameras .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tab of metadata shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is click on the button Download and then download the photos from their camera in a single album . download the photos from their camera and we advise you to check if the pictures were downloaded safely into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you have selected the photos , use the button Download and then select Sel@@ ected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available . these images have not been downloaded until now . in this case the new pictures with a star in the preview window will be downloaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of existing albums will be displayed in which the photos are sorted . the list of existing albums will be displayed in the My Albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ cam ; download the photos from the camera to the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have downloaded the photos you want , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by selecting the Del@@ ete All . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that there is no way to restore the photos you deleted from the camera , so you should carefully check whether the photos were successfully deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the file names are normally recycled , after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names if you want to integrate photos of various shooting ranges into the same album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for data @-@ based sub @-@ albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first two affect the data about the author in the standard Aut@@ ori@@ identity section . if you select this , the entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you wish to use a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % de % H : % M : % S : % M : % M . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using the camera file name option , you have the option of modi@@ fying the file names in lower case letters if you prefer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ code ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ cam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to start shooting . not all cameras provide this information . in the page bar metadata you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic rotation is normally turned on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , it can be used to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this option is normally turned off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based bottom line option on the bottom of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button download . then select upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the image selection is done , you ask &amp; digi@@ cam ; you where the images will be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start loading . the images are not deleted from your computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term used in this document . the data can be used by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to carto@@ gra@@ fi@@ ate an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you forgot about where the photo was taken , you can open a browser which shows the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ cam , you can easily locate the location data of a photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is how to get the GPS data into the picture ? first you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as the direction of the GPS data and picture files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical mapping ( manual ) and last of manual entry of known locations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you need to save these data in g@@ p@@ x format since this is the only format supported by the module for geographical assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can download the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are a few European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ cam ; tries to give you so much control over his work routine as possible . there are many settings that the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings you need to select the panel settings . you can change between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select action can be displayed on Embedded Pre@@ view or start image processing . thus , you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ cam ; firm , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this can be names such as hired photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC Fel@@ der@@ . this allows the metadata to be permanently included in the image , and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
image descriptions as embedded let@@ tering ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in J@@ PEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos with the labels embedded in the pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter is in the main window over a file . depending on the option , this information is displayed or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ cam is attempted you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default settings can be reset to you again , by pressing the button Update to the right of each category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings of the lumin@@ escent sample can be set to the default values on this page . however , if you then use the illuminated button , you should only use different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , you can only get better results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed parts of an image can be marked with a darker or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in the image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling , the images are coded in higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since P@@ NG is using los@@ s@@ less algorithm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the TI@@ FF file option comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality , since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the setting of los@@ s@@ less J@@ PEG 2000 files you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy settings , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with the normal J@@ PEG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tization , image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option paints a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard , it is a fixed color balance based on a white card that is photographed in the sunlight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras , this option is ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default is the spot@@ lights , i.e. the parts of your pictures which are burned into the settings , due to the inability of your camera to capture the spot@@ lights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels in general do not satur@@ ate as quickly as green and red . d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much colour or white you want .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select the option re@@ construct , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be adapted for each image individually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which a matrix coloured pixel is available . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color design .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color gra@@ ding , as it is performed during the rough conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions on how to be given back . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; information about how to translate the color information from a color space into the other , so the colors are as accurate as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behavior Ques@@ tions , if an image is opened in the image processing / paint management module with raw files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
color profile Fol@@ der Sets here the folder such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you can save all your profiles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ICC profiles You have the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles , everything can be changed when opening the raw file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your pictures are not the entire screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all profiles are created in the same way . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not have a color mapping or g@@ amma correction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be done manually , rather than relying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most cameras , it &apos;s pretty obvious which colour profile is intended for . unfortunately , here &apos;s a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is in@@ official : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canon profile expansion lets you realize the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for landscape , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug Interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing ; many modules support that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for short commands for tasks performed by modules , Quick commands can be set in the menu under Settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
further information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project in ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the upper knob controls the time between the transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata on and off , which are displayed at the bottom of the image during display . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the camera properties show a list of all the cameras on the left . on the right side there is a button Automatic detection , trying to identify a camera attached to the computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the bottom you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have an US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path here / m@@ nt / camera / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use &amp; digi@@ plug your digital camera , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring them to display mode and turn on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try out if &amp; digi@@ cam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the option of confirmation dialog for moving images in the tr@@ ash@@ tray , you can view &amp; digi@@ plug the conversation ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find more details in the editing of a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be sil@@ ently through &amp; digi@@ kam . if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any questions , you may need to apply changes to the button changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also stop &amp; digi@@ plug the display of the sp@@ lash screen , which speeds up &amp; digi@@ cam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the starting time for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam . if something is deleted from the base folder , you will ask if it should be deleted from the base folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
different color schemes can be edited and used to customize the main window to suit your taste . you can select these settings under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ cam ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to preview and improve . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry ad / editing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ums , so you may not be part of your distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before using the Save or button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo as soon as you saved the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , you should make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ producing from the File Rest@@ ore or use the button Rest@@ ore Image Processing Re@@ duce in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; virtually any action of image processing can be reversed or restored , and the last action can be reversed by selecting re@@ producing and restoring from the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this frequently , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to return and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; clicking on the back or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be reversed or restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , image down or the entries in the File menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can zoom in and zoom in the picture in which you use C@@ tr@@ l , mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or entries in the menu bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fication factor automatically &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; view Full @-@ screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . if you do not wish to do this , you can change this from the panel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before printing your photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the main menu you can print single pictures or whole sentences . whole image preview pages can be printed out of your choice . you just have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the Menu Export printer driver . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation file . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multiple clicks on the same tab , the side@@ bar will appear or disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . the text is copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so you can be used by other programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2,000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have commented on it , use either the Application button or simply change to the next image , the labels will then be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next to the Application button , you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . this is always done when you select a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evaluation section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field , the code follows the scheme in the following table : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords , keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously ; -@@ session applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the keyword is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of pictures . if you typ@@ ed a variety of keywords , it is stored for quick access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC keyword , keyword . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , date , keyword and search terms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also draw and disc@@ ard keywords . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword is already existing , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and select it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the top example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is selected on no keywords , which reduces the quantity to three images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this search for changes takes place at every start of the program , and it can also be switched off among settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be one or its , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) : the entry , which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string which is already placed in the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , you can specify an advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to group options , just check the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why were pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Flickr not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s specific implementation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that you have a predictable deviation from your camera or scanner . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or sc@@ anners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . additionally , you should make informed choices about color management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you do not have to worry about colour management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB colour space . ( see below for more information )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their only other image expenses are via email or web , where s@@ R@@ GB is de facto standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should one use another color space and think about colour management ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a visual example of limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB colour space in the tri@@ angular region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and click Info and then information About R@@ GB working Sp@@ aces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do I have to cal@@ libr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB colour space ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ R@@ GB colour space or not , you have to cal@@ libr@@ ate your monitor because s@@ R@@ GB is running on s@@ R@@ GB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve one image in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functions Norm@@ alize , Adju@@ st@@ ment , Automatic matching and Con@@ tr@@ ast Exp@@ and from the Menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic Review Just try to make the best of your colors . you &apos;ll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the signal strength values over the whole picture so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magnet correction for pictures that are dark or washed out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this method adju@@ sts the intensity of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel gets the same number of pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible when washed images and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the white balance adjustment is slightly limited because of a color space with 8 bits per color . if you can do the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool is based on a white balance algorithm , protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left , you can see the original image as well as the preview image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the right top a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes when you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are displayed very small lumin@@ ance values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contrast of your results depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade adjustment lets you improve or di@@ mming shadow details of your photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play An@@ stat with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ et settings . the following settings are available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save as and load buttons . each setting of the white balance you have set , you can save it in a text file and re@@ charge it later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in a different photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used J@@ PEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding needs more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool will open the same dialogue as to how to edit raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . a detailed manual for use of color profiles can be used to determine the chapter colour management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , so that you can use it for several photos . this is useful if your camera or your scanner always need the same correction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a very powerful way of correc@@ ting exposure problems is the gra@@ dation tool , that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digi@@ code tool has four color effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ter filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the colored , darker areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intensity controls the solar isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an example of the solar energy effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) , the applied intensity is 30 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brill@@ ant and g@@ lowing .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film ; the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ne@@ on@@ light simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to adjust the color contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can experiment with the different color patterns of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustment can be previ@@ ew@@ ed in the preview .
if you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the opposite problem : a too big satur@@ ation . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will reduce the satur@@ ation rather than increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the complex mould gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ amp / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool tone correction is set to improve exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into them and the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the control , and watch out how the picture changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the right you can see the original and preview of the image . the preview is dynamic , based on the settings of the image . on the left @-@ hand side , the following options are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three shades can be used in preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; output values : the output values allow selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to change the output values , e.g. , to create a light picture as a background while something else is seen in the foreground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save as and load : using these buttons , the set values can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p Levels Format is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input values will automatically be adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to display over @-@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below is an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image are displayed . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modi@@ fying channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel , which is modified by the module : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . linear mode is usually the most sensible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you move a short part to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright sounds correspond to darker output tones and the corresponding pixels are darker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in preview of the original photos , you can see a red marker . if you want to change this selection on the area you want to change , create a matching line on this line and move it down and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
save as and load : using these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p cam format .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to display over @-@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel mixer of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image processing is a tool for improving color channels , or changing the color shad@@ ings of the photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colours of the images , and you can edit it from the Color channel Mixer menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . when you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram shows you the corresponding color value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance the image will retain the overall brightness as the channel bl@@ ender is then THE tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise occurring in the color channel . if that &apos;s the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion so you can reduce the color space first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save any mixer setting for later , and then load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel bl@@ ender format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to display over @-@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the lumin@@ ance option is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image under ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography is black / white a work step as color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of movie roll@@ bars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford Delta 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford P@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford P@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white filter light with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portrait against the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates black / white film imaging with an orange l@@ enti@@ cular filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white filter light with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day , i.e. similar to 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Red Filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white filter light with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones while adding a bit of col@@ dness in the shad@@ ow@@ y tones . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aking a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ ph@@ onic . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ ec@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool texture , you can apply decorative textures to a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by adding a texture to your picture , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied in the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the modified one ( 2 ) to see . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when digi@@ ti@@ zed ; add tool frame , a decorative frame can be added to an image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
keeping an eye on a be@@ holder within the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep its attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . permanently converting the image with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , it surrounds it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is important for printing the images , especially if you have previously used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this also works in several places if you need it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . the larger the image size , the bigger the character set must be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you click the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool template , you can put a template on a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apply the picture sten@@ cil menu in the image processing , to place templates over a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and want to add the template file size to the template . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the root folder has been set for templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder will be automatically updated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the preview , you find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enlarge This button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the entire image , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move : use this button to move the picture below the template . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use OK if you want to apply the template to your image , then the image will be automatically adapted to the preview size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional sharpen@@ ing tool . it is very quick and easy , but it creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blur@@ r mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . actually it sharp@@ ens no bit ; it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric dun@@ nage and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken out of Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjusting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ sed images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tis@@ ation process is combined with only minimal differences to a color point . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras typically require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in J@@ PEG pictures , a camera is often used internal sharp@@ ness . in contrast , images in raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some scanner uses a field of sharp@@ ness during reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photograph with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can call the Cor@@ rec@@ t Focus using the menu entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should deal with caution since the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too crisp . the solution to draw the picture a bit is much easier than shar@@ pen it . use the tool to sof@@ ten the image with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ess sof@@ as and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter blur@@ red is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original image and preview help to edit the image , and the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first be tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image , which is added to the original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ t from shar@@ per and therefore avoid fla@@ ws in faces , sky and water surfaces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an example of the blur@@ red filter filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.@@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed tool re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted extraction filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tr@@ ation . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tr@@ ation . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tr@@ ation . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tr@@ ation . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tr@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos; F@@ itting has a very long tail , which also influences the mathematical result from the source pixel which is far from the original pixel . this causes unwanted results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should yield 1 good results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ening effect of the module .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may use this parameter to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you might need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in matrix size can produce good results especially if you select great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the palate . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focuss@@ ing parameter you have set will thus be saved for later , and can then be loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to perform all cutting , color and intensity corrections in the image before using the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that there are many operations that are not immediately visible , but that later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as J@@ PEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , blur@@ red masks produce better results than sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by blur@@ ring a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even under optimal conditions , the result of the F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ ters is often better in handling small details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this picture has been made with an analog camera , the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information on the methods of sharpen@@ ing in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the knob enhances the blur@@ ring of the area of the dark@@ ened zone , thereby creating a more natural pup@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools , to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool contains various default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration , and the available default settings are listed below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab for smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; detail preservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to smooth smooth@@ ness over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details so that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly into all directions while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed close to 1 . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ arity or CCD exc@@ itation , a high value wave @-@ like patterns will be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ y.@@ p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeti@@ tions : specify how often the algorithm is passed . normally , here is 1 or 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angle distance da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected , it should also be small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integrated stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated stri@@ de length in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never exceed 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by choosing this option is only low , but it doubles the running time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buttons saving as and loading make exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file , and loaded later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correct image errors are comparatively very fast at work . however , it can still last very long and have a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the ab@@ ort button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see how picture errors are corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module is shown on a photo that has been made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a strange black arti@@ fact created during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts such as dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can stay in default settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
radius controls the window size from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front in order to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong it cannot remove all noise or noise peaks . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak h@@ iss or J@@ PEG @-@ arti@@ facts without details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to enhance a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details pane .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to enhance a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details pane .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma area of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas which are typically tough@@ ened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; atten@@ uation : controls the alignment of the phan@@ tom shock absorption . this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smo@@ other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored into the file system , and loaded later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected with ( 2 ) , the noise reduction was applied with default settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a bit sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen and experiment with the smooth@@ ing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; digi@@ tization ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools , to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ul@@ ture , scratches , compression arti@@ facts and local mistakes made in digital , original or later digit@@ alized images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture substitution . the texture mapping is done with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ PEG arti@@ facts reduce : compression of J@@ PEG is not perfect in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm it produces some compression &amp; quot ; - small standards that are shown in the un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buttons saving as and loading make exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file , and loaded later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can still last very long and a high CPU load . so you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ ende . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can reduce how a photo with uni@@ formed h@@ iss is being restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera was recorded onto a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and corrected under ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below you can see another example for photo restoration . this time , textures are reduced to an old color photograph that has been read with a scanner . you can see the original image below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows to remove pixel @-@ pixel photos from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos as many cameras with J@@ PEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important to capture the dark picture directly to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should find the right dark@@ room to the corrected picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image area and preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . after that , select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dur@@ cut : an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
linear : all pixels which have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ linear interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the faulty pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the pixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ code ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead , they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter , which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s fil@@ men@@ and the color or gray scale of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using an equi@@ val@@ ent transformation using a C@@ enter@@ filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with three controllers , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and with three further control of the target image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density of the filter . the default density is 2.@@ 0 , resulting in an aperture setting of 1 , or randomly a light intensity of 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you will need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of exposure of the target image , let the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . however , color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric distortion of the lens , and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s off edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coefficient fourth grade correc@@ ts the distant corners towards that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can almost be eliminated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally : this value controls the thickness of the distortion second degree . with negative values , sound @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree . this value appears more strongly on the margins than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; Corner parameter &apos; has the reverse sign of the parameter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zoom : this value res@@ sively sc@@ aled the image size , resulting in a correction of the first degree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bright : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog provides a preview of the distortion . the values you use for your image are saved and used at the next start as default values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ton@@ er- and cushion distortion should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best , perform this correction as all the first . in case you have to cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ ical correction , the effect would be obvious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea border or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Menu Trans@@ forming blan@@ ks from the image processing or via the Zoom knob of this dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next logical step for some motives like images from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simulate the inf@@ ring@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website , which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can look at the effect on different parts of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gran@@ ul@@ arity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the Option Per@@ ge Movie kör@@ tion if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller alters the amount of film gran@@ ul@@ ture and the domin@@ ance of the colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the filter bl@@ ends colour channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter script applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter film gran@@ ul@@ ator is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ul@@ ture on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film gran@@ ulation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to post@@ p@@ one back into the past . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , on ISO 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the film gran@@ ulation effect on a black / white image applied . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that edited the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and style life are good for this effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the upper dial sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brush is better for large images . smooth@@ es controls the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon z@@ eme . the lines whose gra@@ dients change slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch out .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used , and the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter engraving defines your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works very well with images with a simple structure in which color is not the most important thing about content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey and mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the depth allows to set the contrast of the filter . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells , and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave @-@ blocks 1 , the picture is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some effects require long time for calculation and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time , with the button Be@@ ende . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom lens : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a central point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a central point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ ts the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear motion , z : B : from a car or train taking photographs , camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sof@@ tening blur@@ ring : bl@@ urs the picture soft in the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ts the image through random displacement of pixels , simul@@ ating the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligent uncertainty : finds the coloured pools in the picture , and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some effects require long time for calculation and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Be@@ ende . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . by doing so , it gives you natural your images a wet look . it uses an algorithm protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can choose with &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing a range free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it by mirr@@ oring or turning into the right direction . you can find the tools in the menu transform@@ ers turning or transforming mirrors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; infl@@ ating photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo , at a minimum loss of image quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in or guess the details ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transform@@ ations change in the menu and specify the target values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to get closer to the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , then try to blow up the tool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation ; e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo Recovery was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab , and are listed below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maintain the aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buttons save as and load are used exactly to that . enlarge image file can be saved as text file , and loaded later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; infl@@ ating photo is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a long time and get a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ ende . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can see below an example of photo blowing by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 2 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a photo , simply press the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rect@@ angle , then you will see the rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you release the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the cutting button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the preview pane , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tool Acc@@ ording to aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the larger value of the height and the cross @-@ format is assigned to the width . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ aper and their aspect ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below in the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to cut the area to the maximum possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you use the cutting tool for the next time , these settings are stored as default values in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the image and not the original image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sett@@ ling aid settings allow help to blend in , so that you can better assemble your images . these help are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
harmonious triangle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ el@@ hed@@ geho@@ gs harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in a similar harmonic tri@@ angles to the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden centre : the golden middle is a split that focuses on various natural growth patterns like the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational figure 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden divide in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 and etc . the divi@@ der divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the golden centre provides fluid relief lines , when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison to the third el@@ bow , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition results in the view of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this can be a line or different objects . this can be a line or different objects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles also diver@@ t from the golden spiral discussed above . in contrast to harmonic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diagonal to these lines can be seen more dynamically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break down your frame you create an effect of professional phot@@ ograph@@ s dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles .
the horizontal mirror options and verti@@ ces can be used to mirror the harmonic spl@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the button Color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Free Press is a tool to rotate a picture to any angle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture where things are turned around an angle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can reset the slider to 0 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . now adjust the mouse poin@@ ter to the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after you shot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix this is to use the function Transform@@ ers cro@@ pping from the image processing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an elegant way to crop the image is the Automati@@ cally cut , select one of the following options : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ s the image a bit after rotation . however , please note the above warning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed at a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new heights : shows the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little swe@@ eter . for a single adaptation , this effect is small but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to crop the image with transform@@ ers cut out of the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the placement tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is not rotation , the image is distorted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can shave horizontally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be displayed to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to your help , a vertical and horizontal line will disappear . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the coding tool to adjust your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have done the she@@ ar , the image will be blur@@ red . for a single shot this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two ch@@ amp@@ ings produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after graduation , the picture has un@@ si@@ ghtly tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is to crop the image with transform@@ ers cut out of the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ cam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and in some cases from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find J@@ PEG and TI@@ FF under it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ cam ; shows only files in formats that know . this is done using the file extension and comparing it with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of file extensions . see the Con@@ figuration section for more information .
nearly all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : J@@ PEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to even select the format you want to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images . redundant information is reduced to save image data in a more efficient way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ PEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than J@@ PEG for the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also store los@@ s@@ less if it is specified in the settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ code ; supports loading of raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program which is included ; all support cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of shell formats supported by &amp; digi@@ ac ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in Avi@@ - or MPEG format . this clips are commonly used in Avi@@ - or MPEG format ; but is not a film editing software and therefore has no built @-@ in options to display or edit films ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies to start playback .

K@@ IP@@ I module that exports a number of images to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can change the steps 4 and 5 , which you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can finish the first four alignment with the module white balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam , your description follows here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft signs , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , blur@@ ring , &amp; etc ; use a consistent slide type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . on the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparative mode of the preview area . these modes are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left pane shows the original , and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horizontal divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper part shows the original , and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divide vertically , the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horizontal divide , the upper part shows the original and the lower the effect of the filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in preview , otherwise the original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2 ) : there are two buttons , which can be switched on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image that you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 5 ) : in the lower left corner , here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side bar features the essential information about the selected image , and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo features : show a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data , if they are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tab provides an intuitive map scanning tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out and move it . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes , selecting and nam@@ ing colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pallets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , you are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the dialog Palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets , or browse folders for files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved , by clicking on the area next to a color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color is described below the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the check box Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor is selected under the button Color the color is inserted from the color plate at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode is selected over@@ write .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a selection which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and inser@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line display . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the colors in the palette , and the output of the color selection can be dragged along with the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a color somewhere on the screen , then find it in the color selection on the left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program used for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; graphs . graphs are used in science - especially in computer science . so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; dot ; graphs ; graphs and graphs ; graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Bs ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( making a change of the graph in &amp; dic@@ ates ; the graph will re@@ compu@@ te and in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; adver@@ ts ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; in one &amp; Bs ; component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; required for the representation of graphs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; without a argument the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list Rec@@ ently open files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting one or more &amp; dot , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right when pressing &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below , you can see the maximum reduction of a graph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the currently in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will appear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can choose whether or not you want to re@@ charge the graph , or if you want to ignore the change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ art viewer ; eg . in the file browser or the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance or to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at program start , you can open all the graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as change later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also specify how to split the graph to several pages , and the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph will be aligned to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out from the respective parts of the graph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without header , and with a different font &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Renew@@ able shop page gives you the possibility to specify behaviour when a file has been modified on your hard disk , eg . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or repeat the program every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the page opening gives you the option to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time it is requested .
the session management page gives you the possibility to set the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the last session files ) or decide to be asked at every start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up more possibilities : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can select from various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) , and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ coated graphs . it produces representations in accordance with the boun@@ ce spring model . in doing so , the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm uses statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a boun@@ ce @-@ spring model for un@@ coated graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ der@@ man Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi@@ player trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co algorithm adju@@ sts the k@@ not according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for specific diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialog with which you can specify a layout command , which will then be executed by a shell . the command should specify the graph file as parameter , and modify the calculated layout of the graph after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
determines the type of graph ( judged or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ coated graphs ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is checked , the overview will be displayed if needed . otherwise it will not be shown and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows the mouse poin@@ ter . with this mouse @-@ cur@@ sor , click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get further help to this item ( if available ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; in the Settings menu , you will find more options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five parts : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the second color palette and the grid pattern in which you draw the symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creates a new symbol . if the current file has been modified , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not have a step und@@ o und@@ o , this function is disabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
add the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set the current symbol in gray scale . this can create colors , which do not match those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read , read and save new images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports through the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you open the menu entry , a dialog box appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by clicking on the default duc@@ r@@ he image to select your image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make sure the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not display . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after pressing the button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image to be saved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screen@@ shots can be created after you have selected in the menu Im@@ porting &gt; Screen Photo ... , a window appears in which you can adjust the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the entire desktop , to read a single window under the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , read the currently visible work@@ space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after creating the screen@@ shot , the dialog options dialog appears with the options described above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet . with Flickr it is possible to show your photos to people who are important . you can place your favorite photos in the world to show the photos of your camera and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the ex@@ porting module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a token . thus , it is your identification to Flickr . a browser is started so you can log in to Flickr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the successful registration , the module can send photos to the Flickr website . you will be presented the following page after a successful registration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after clicking Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr . this will be shown in the next section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ex@@ porting module is launched to Flickr for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog that displays the current access rights that the module displays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you click on the O@@ k button , you can select the photos you want to upload to the Flickr server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words , these are added to the image as keywords during the upload . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can set the access rights to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select the option Change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered with maximum size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images , so the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie export has no documentation currently . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical location allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the image &apos;s EX@@ IF keyword , and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic location provides tools to loc@@ alize images from the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinates system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width are used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ li you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical location Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . to perform a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation tests the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the setting for the maximum time deviation is a top deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation is below the data is merged , the maximum value is 2000 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you do not have trace data from one place for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location is located between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then push the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location . as the dialog opens up the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select the region and select si@@ e.@@ Don &apos;t use it until you have reached a sufficient degree of accuracy . the height must always be changed manually . the card can be switched between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Picture Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is en@@ coded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to facilitate the best internation@@ alization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tab allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select the albums that are exported to HTML . in the area below , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option For each image you create a page created a gallery in which each image will be displayed . otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer .
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected the J@@ PEG file format , EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with other color depth you can change the default color depth . of course , it also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tab view images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnail images , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a progress window displays the user , how far the action is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the module has created the pages , the window is not automatically closed . therefore , you can read the program messages to see if bugs have occurred during production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and use basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . it is designed for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the start , a picture will be displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I J@@ PEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module allows to save images in J@@ PEG format for the actions below , without the usual losses of quality and metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size is increasing , since no compression of the color information takes place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. note : the participants of this list speak English .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , the K@@ IP@@ I module has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Metad@@ ata module import function , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image you want to copy in the main program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this function does not work in all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write in any target format . J@@ PEG is supported while writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Co@@ vers Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , you need to select the images that are packed into the MPEG slide show . after that you can create over Extras MPEG slide show the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images you select are then listed under image files in the portfolio , where you can also change the list or the content of the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pre @-@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds to display a picture . the speed of the image transition is defined below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , you can start generating the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now take a coffee and enjoy the slide when you are back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an indication appears that the codes or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages on the right side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also automatically be opened using the Gim@@ p image processing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format in one of three formats J@@ PEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from d@@ cra@@ w is not that it generates the same results as the software from your camera creator . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RA@@ W file that should be converted and launch the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter Window appears in mode for a single image . with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected , so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you are pleased with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . J@@ PEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information of your image and uses los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you plan to edit your images frequently or otherwise use it otherwise , you should not choose the J@@ PEG format since there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select J@@ PEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the J@@ PEG file in the Ex@@ if information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion using the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use it to cancel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing at a single image , which are the best settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing files . this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album , using the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this module can be used to modify the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or enlarge the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ functional : no proportional size changes in two dimensions , the aspect ratio is changed at this option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; printing preparation : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more pictures with a file selection dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also drag pictures to the picture list , and place it there to add the list of images to be sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the button Add images , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after selecting all the images you can open the New message window of your email client using the OK button . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you select are already attached as attachments .
pay attention not to send many pictures at once . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending images , and their configuration is saved and used every time until you change them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments will be added to the images in a text file and added the mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ NG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select J@@ PEG under Pictures file format and the original files are in J@@ PEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the process is finished , the window is not automatically closed so you can view the status messages , searching for errors , but your e @-@ mail program is automatically started at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after starting the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au module , you will find a window with questions like you want to display your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all the images of the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Open@@ GL option in the presentation enables very elegant image transitions with Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the file name option indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner , during the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the loop of the loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop , then manually with Es@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option Images by randomly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order , so it is not used to order the pictures in the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the distance between the images can be set between the individual pictures . 1500 mil@@ lis@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are over a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . randomly , each transition between the images chooses a different effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this tool bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the left lower screen edge , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set up a picture as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub @-@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with comments , you can browse through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are now entries in people , places and in group keywords . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your images and videos with notes . additionally there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current preview images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press the mouse with the mouse , the browser &apos;s view changes . see picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select another person , only the images shown on which both individuals are visible . by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings you can view with preview images to view the pictures of your area of activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the picture every person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own preview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to view images next to the names , select the button that is located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . this has the advantage that you can display the view for each category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , you have to choose which image to be displayed for each individual . in the context menu you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the context menu you can select the image for the corresponding person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you visit the search engine in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you enter a string of characters in the let@@ tering or description field the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the pictures are searched for this text . if you want you can also enter a date where you want ; i.e. for example 1971 or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the options in the bottom part of the window , you can search all the images by certain names as you can see in the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the user manual for your photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather like to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go to the Homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduction videos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog if you want to start the demo ; for the first time you can start or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of your photo@@ album ; try it out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar is shown here : . as the name says it shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can preview the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the time line will always display the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select a range of time bar by holding down the mouse button and display the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides two ways to create HTML pages with your pictures . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the HTML menu ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and destination . in the following each area is described more accurately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you enter the title of the overview and a description , which should contain the HTML file later . on a photo@@ album ; HTML example pages , see an example of these settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid the fact that all images are displayed by a party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this section , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not addressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the bottom of the page you can set up various resolutions for the pictures . this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time . so it can display your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this setting , you specify the various folders and URL where your site is stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all your HTML files , select a base folder and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you need to select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after creating your images , you can check if you select a URL for the base folder . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser should be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these settings , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name will be set to the output folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you might want to add an HTML page to view the pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others to your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . you can see if the images are stored in the file or if there is only one link to images in the file . the obvious disadvantage is however the file size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the Export menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , search the images that are in the .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described which you can access via the File Export menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be an internal or external .@@ k@@ im file . the following three options are available :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you copy the manual to the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; copy &amp; photo@@ album from Automati@@ cally , copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images have already been compressed with J@@ PEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last option of this page is maximum screen size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import menu , you will import &amp; photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the assistant to import consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images are to be copied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is named in your database . therefore you will be asked in the third dialog window which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they correspond to in your database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fourth step , you can balance the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be easy to search and watch images : if you look at pictures , you often want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this manual , you will pass the various steps from ( 1 ) to submit the information about your images , through ( 2 ) the browsing and viewing until ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your pictures . it has been expanded and now your videos will take care of it . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this includes videos with one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml file in the top folder of its image . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo@@ album ; mem@@ ori@@ ze the folder where your images are stored and use this in future starts automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start with the -@@ c option . for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / image / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
via the menu entry settings K@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can go to a window that lets you change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual the various settings are explained to you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of preview and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available which can be accessed by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it describes how you can set various properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this section , sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialogue options , you can set up complete members groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group are set up in a group instead of all groups of a member . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the list below you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window , you can select the category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ c@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug @-@ in interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the modules can and are not described in this manual , since they cannot be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; but most modules do have a help page that you can access via the module itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the modules of multiple applications are shared among each other , you can test new modules first with the command &gt; k@@ Photo@@ Album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t tell me , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the applications using the K@@ IP@@ I modules are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications also use their images in albums : this kind of order does not support it simul@@ ates the order after albums for some modules to make use of the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus simul@@ ating and k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all the images that show you the picture preview right now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the current album , you have to photo@@ album ; the modules also list a list of albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or it will use the category you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , use the category people , so do if you have selected people to view and pass it on to the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the picture , you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start your photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see it from any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . below the tool@@ bar you will see the window where you can browse your image database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture . for example you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example on all images Jes@@ per is shown and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these ann@@ ot@@ ations when you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are a very important part of your photo@@ album , since you can always use them again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be moved to find the people faster and assign them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the icon for sorting by date under the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected any ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image , you might want to edit all selected images and ann@@ ot@@ ate these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , then it may be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ lap . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also put an entry into a category and place it there in order to sort it alphabe@@ tically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move and move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar , which form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by pulling it out of the window pane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... that allows you to save the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also fade out a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options ... and then hide the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select the images in your browser , you will get an overview of thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you do not have a filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as background image for your desktop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you click on a picture , this is displayed in the picture viewer . if you do not open a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the appropriate pictures from which you want to delete , and select either the removal key or select from the Edit menu . now the window will display you that you can see in the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the images anywhere to be saved on your hard disk . in the picture you have to have the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the images you need can be loaded from the hard disk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images in which the upper corner is cut off are not saved on the hard disk . for example , the images 1 @-@ 9 are available , so you can view the preview pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , you need to copy files from folders and copy them back . if you want to avoid trouble on how to avoid mess@@ ing your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pictures menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images to the end that you may want to see for others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , you have defined which images should be hidden in the case of everything . if you want to give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also possible to set a password to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select your password from the Privacy Settings menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please bear in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure . on one hand , anyone who can access the inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml file can access the password as un@@ encrypted text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason why you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to see them sometime . for this reason features &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; using a picture _ and video viewer . this can be started from the preview as described .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see the viewer inside . of course , it shows the image , but additional all information you have to enter via the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to see the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can also simply drag them to the viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on this , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and return by using the buttons picture high and image down . you can go to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . as frequently it loads a new image after a few seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full@@ screen mode and back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you use the viewer , you can zoom into the image and zoom out . zoom the zoom button to zoom out the zoom button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that the only zoom operations that work with videos , that are in and zoom out with the plus and sub @-@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the script functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work in videos . you can ann@@ ot@@ ate comments from the current picture with the menu item Rem@@ arks from the contex@@ tual menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you look at pictures it can happen that you &apos;ll find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to name this name .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look at one after the other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature set by the characters A , B and C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have set characteristics on your pictures , these are available in your browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you want to display categories in dre preview view , you can add attributes to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you will be allowed to paint on the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to stop the painting of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select View on the picture from the pop @-@ up menu . simply put the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you have to master the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you necessarily read and understood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an object that is already selected , as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to add to the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to enable you to select the correct position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Del@@ ete , either from the menu bar , or from the right mouse button menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message with an error description will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can preview the properties view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; press preview in the properties view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default the whole texture is rendered , even if you want a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screen shot shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can move these check@@ points with the mouse button , thereby changing the position and direction of the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and turning as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag with the mouse within the entire window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; objects are displayed relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected , or the visibility stage chosen in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different order , you can adjust them arbitr@@ arily . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to anchor a window over or under a view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to assign multiple views to one another , pull the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map icon at the top of the views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the starter to the desktop or click on the small left pointing arrow in the fas@@ cia bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can add additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current window view can save you with view window order ... Save . a dialog appears , in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering ; this program has to be installed correctly . as this manual was written was &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering Symbol Ren@@ ders icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full @-@ quality images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender modes , the following dialog is opened : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each render mode has a name . you can type any name , however it is a name that makes sense to recognize the properties of the mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box below and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination field quality you can select the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these mistakes . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and links &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . the standard is adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive approach ; the second method is adap@@ tively @-@ recur@@ sively ; the second method is adaptive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel depends on the calculated colour values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you choose the first method POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray of pixels per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold . if you set the depth value to 4 then a grid of 4x4 will be calculated using super @-@ sampling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 @-@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 @-@ b 2 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels which can be further monitored and further sub@@ divided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on j@@ itter@@ ing it changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays round a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use reflection light . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this card card , you can adjust if the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays are not affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; unexpectedly terminated , you can find the reason for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select File Im@@ porting ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full range of commands from &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . this adds to the source text in the editor . to import objects into the scene , just select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor , you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click on Help in the Property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ timeter data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder &apos;s folder , you must also enter the path to these files here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the colour of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view , and in the window type plates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the object catch to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here , you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects like the ball you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tick the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tick the floor , a floor beneath the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tick the edges , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value in the R@@ ender modes section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window order section , you will explain how to create and store window orders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combination panel standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window order at the start of the program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of existing window classi@@ fications shows all existing window classi@@ fications . a new arrangement can be created with the addition button , and del@@ eting a selected arrangement with the button removal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every window order is identified by the name , the name must be unique and must not be empty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the addition button , and delete selected views with the button removal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so you have straight &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and now you want to start with no more precise knowledge of both programs . if you can follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene : a sphere at a level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you will only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not include light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have installed everything correctly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will have to use these menus and icons frequently , so you should remember the menus and icons as well as their application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit but@@ ton@@ . now you have a scene without objects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wi@@ re@@ design view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene &apos;s rendering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , you can see the contents of the object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions but note that the camera in the view has control points to which you can change the camera &apos;s destination . simply click a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press the button or press the input button , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert final body qu@@ aders ) and size at x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a complicated method to solve this task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually , offering a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button Application or the input button . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wire @-@ model view now also shows the plane , although at the moment only as a limited end@@ ental level . if you render the scene , the plane extends to the horizon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : scale , rotation and shift . in this case you will see the default options for each new object : scale , rotation and shift . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit beneath the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first select the ground to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both cases , a dialog box opens in which you can select how to insert the object . the pigment will then change in the object tree . you can see the name in the property View menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the pig@@ ments previ@@ ew@@ ing shows only a matt black material because you can still type settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can review the appearance of materials at any time with a click . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on a fa@@ der and a ball in preview , then click on the Application button and then enter the preview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your picture now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the object tree , choose one time and change colors in the object view : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step should be done easily , because you should have understood the basic method of working of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easy as the floor : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the input button or the button Application ) , so the ball would float above the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course rendering a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the ground , give the ball a pigment as color : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select First Under@@ ground and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere pigment , then select In@@ color and set the values as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots , and click App@@ lic@@ it or press the input button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brightness effect and reflection result in partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces even if metal : not yet selected : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should now have a good idea of the possibilities for you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully , you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer will shoot hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ covers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this menu entry can only be selected , if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repe@@ ats the last und@@ am@@ ended command . this menu entry can only be selected , if you have previously used editing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . with this option , you can change the default short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; modify or add new commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialog for setting up the tool@@ bars . with this option , you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each diff@@ ra@@ ction individually , without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump mapping as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis , by applying a image file as a color map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images can be displayed in a separate window , in the size of the image or in full screen mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , is very simple . the file browser lists files you can display with clicking on &amp; L@@ MB@@ n , or the Return key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can adjust if any image should be displayed in its own window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are searching for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then , a small input field appears in the lower right corner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in dialogue - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective window can be specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can further set . default is not full screen mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you are still viewing the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start opening &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the screen background in full@@ screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background color is filled with the selected color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can show &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , so set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , large images display the display window on the full screen . this option is turned on as default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
determines if the slide show should start with the first picture in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or small arrows on the right side of the input field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the small arrows on the right side of the input field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shows large symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is also closed when no browser window is open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; view the image in original size . this is only useful , if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the entry field for completion . enter the first characters of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user will contribute its part to , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows a dialogue with a link . if you use it , your browser opens a page to report issues and wishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers will help each other . if you are a more common user of &amp; show@@ photo ; then we would like to ask you to ask other users of &amp; show@@ photo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; try to give as much control over your work@@ flows as possible . to access these settings , you will need to select show@@ photo in the Settings menu . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ exposure indicator is selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; features a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also view this in which you click on one of the five tabs :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a standard scanner can be placed on the command line of &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; if this scanner is not opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can select the scanner to be used , and press OK to open the scanner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these options are not special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to scan an image , the user can start a pre @-@ scan and then scan for the final scan . the preview scan is started by the preview button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when saving a preview in the settings , the image will appear in a preview window that is shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and you will get back to the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Settings button opens the dialogue of the same name in front of the main window , and you can change the most important settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option before saving a preview must be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , the option must be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting allows you to select the type like &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; images can be selected . dialog for each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if you want to save this automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting defines where the images are saved in the Save without a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for dialogue to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for automatically storing pictures and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time , when a picture is stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the button &apos; Help starts the K@@ DE aid with the &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button Crossing will start the K@@ DE On @-@ dialog for &amp; Canon ; the button Settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to termin@@ ate &amp; ann@@ l@@ ite .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set up a list of these abbrevi@@ ations and their function . below , you can set up a list of these abbrevi@@ ations and their function . you can set up the global key short@@ wave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may set up existing Multimedia keys in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; Quick commands work , making your keyboard an &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; control centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common features which can usually be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions from collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , playlist browsers and scripts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency . please check in your script if all the required modules are present , and use k@@ dialog to verify why a script doesn &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
start @-@ up require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { Error } &apos; exit end
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ o@@ ok and control Amar@@ o@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the D@@ CO@@ P command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most scrip@@ ting languages enable the execution of external programs and commands . in this way , D@@ CO@@ P &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . this is why strings should continuously monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; configure Soft &apos;s script to display the setup dialog . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; track@@ Change indicates that a new piece is picked up . the script could now query &amp; z@@ b , with D@@ CO@@ P functions for more information about the new piece ( for example metadata or piece length ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
volume Change inherent volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ tit@@ le paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a custom menu entry is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le are also passed to allow the script to be used to remove one &apos;s entry . to remove an entry you can use D@@ CO@@ P Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ate , or when the user stops a script , send &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b download ; such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can be optionally available with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the extension amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script pack@@ ets right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if your script package is ready you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i script page of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de apps you should use the Amar@@ ok category ; scripts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features , but is surprisingly easy to use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of working through endless menus . you may also search for a certain title from thousands in your collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just right for you . and if the decision is still difficult , choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . this and many other useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , you have to type the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , should you do not have any trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated to compile time using the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies need to be met so that they can be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activate de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , you should use full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can be setup without effort using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ l@@ bar . the option switches to the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok , compiled with the support for m@@ ood@@ l@@ bar . this changes the colour scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
add mood files to the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled .@@ mood files in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok , should be started when a browser is needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save the playlist when saving , the current playlist will automatically store when you exit &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok will use relative paths to the music files based on the location of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visi@@ bly keeping a piece of play visible , make sure that the playlist window pop@@ s up / off to keep the current part in the visible window pane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when changing the context browser , automatically changes the context browser as soon as the next piece is picked up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the font section you can select the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . selecting your own fonts will be enabled . you can select fonts for the following range : playlist windows , Player window and context browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the choice of custom colour scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set up your own color scheme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continue playing at the start , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start the playback will automatically continue with the piece where it was stopped at the last stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting up the on @-@ screen display enables you to switch on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , you can preview the O@@ SD and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first option is font . click App@@ ly ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD , the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog to the color selection . if own colors do not use the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screen option is designed for X@@ in@@ ama users , so you can set on which screen of a multi @-@ screen environment the O@@ SD is to appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box , some drivers still activate additional setting options in this card card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection , including the folder and type of database for the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can select the folders that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , as well as browsing the sub@@ folders as well as their sub@@ folders to music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; im@@ porting play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , adding all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the section Collec@@ ting database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected another device is needed in My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l configuration section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; on machine : will the host enter on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is entered . then the network port is entered under which the database name is entered . name : is the database name to which the connection is made .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the card@@ card last@@ .@@ f@@ m provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; send the played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; access similar interpre@@ ters : after activation of this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok , a list with similar interpre@@ ters can be viewed . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD are predic@@ ting that your window manager will use the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ o@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t as they provide an excellent development environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . after that you can delete the file which caused the crash . after that you can delete the file and create the collection again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the time , it is because tag@@ li@@ b crash@@ es when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is a bit more mature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , tag@@ li@@ b compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , this leads to crash@@ es when working the Met@@ a information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable automatic . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically for a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash , and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into met@@ a @-@ info@@ s , but do not mark this as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re @-@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / Dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can click on a symbol in the Control Centre under Ap@@ pear@@ ance Symb@@ ols . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol button until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fix this bug , you may need to remove any colli@@ ding Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to find the correct version first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please bear in mind a bug , if you are interested in fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , appears only an empty playlist . how do music pieces come in there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder , then drag the files to the right part of the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the Start window has been converted to the Statisti@@ cs window . you will find it under Extras Statisti@@ cs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for rating by the user , while the points are calculated automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column show rating . you can also use the Quick commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ o@@ ok is in the background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the files you want to remove , then press de on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select from playlist removed from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drag a playlist file to the playlist and drop it down , just as you would make it with other files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , next to the addition button , you can save the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual . this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) , and you can also find it through the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must be : which media types support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ 5mm ? . as you can see , we can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may ! you may use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 de@@ co@@ ders are included in the default setting ( for pat@@ ent@@ ative reasons ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink the device has to provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the output of this command should help you search for the problem of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you might need to specify a different link ( e.g. os@@ sin@@ sink ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can &apos;t just send a white noise to AL@@ SA . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people when you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people . G@@ Stre@@ amer is sending the file and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of arts . open your sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( see next point of FAQ ! ) .
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either you do not use the arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver was greatly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the Stre@@ amer driver , it crash@@ es &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you will need to register all the components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # g@@ asp@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try this ( stop Amar@@ o@@ peg before ! ) : - Download the m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all the m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let it run with the alarm of this command : D@@ CO@@ P Amar@@ ok player play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make sure that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; run before you go to bed , then you are wo@@ ken up by the gentle tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you learn the current in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , current titles when you &apos;re on another computer ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a working SS@@ H environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the performer and title of the running unit : ss@@ h -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP D@@ CO@@ P --@@ user &apos;s user name Amar@@ o@@ player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , window . click on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button places a piece in the click sequence in the queue . by pressing the input button , after searching in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search returned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK , the player window and playlist have tricky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , click the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database can not be created and many error messages appear on the console . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ o@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the CD , then select a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ) ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , and &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escape string ) ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more often the piece has been played , the less influence each individual review has on the overall score . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select the rating for a piece yourself by clicking on a column heading in the playlist window . then you can change the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes , by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and edit : you can also edit the rating in dialog metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the developers do not want to tell you when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term set plan of Amar@@ ok .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . disable the option icon while playing in the General Settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool@@ bars , and take the desired changes there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context browser design , click to install New Design .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor and control of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; while browsing in Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click on the Settings button ( the top ) and select from the Add Amar@@ o@@ ok button .
audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information on which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crash@@ es and a lot of bug reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ amm@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install Amar@@ o@@ ok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you probably need to install a distribution that will install the development files separately from the actual program . even though G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you will need to install x@@ ine de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : don &apos;t use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module was installed stream fa@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you play an MP3 Stream , but the module stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run it as system administrator register . then restart amar@@ ok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set up under settings Amar@@ o@@ ok ... Audio output type the device . typical is , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a onboard AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check on sound card support m@@ map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you can of course take this problem by yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed assistant for arts : ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to music ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard , which will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , then this quick start guide will help you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the small text box to filter the collection facilitates the search for specific pieces . if you are content with the playlist , you can save it with the playlist &apos;s playlist . you will find this button in the playlist window tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add it to the playlist . if the playlist is included in the folder &apos;s folder , you will find the playlist in the tree view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play an audio CD , please select actions audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audio CD function uses the Audi@@ oc@@ d protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply click on an entry with the right mouse button , and follow the burning menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; requires installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . besides , some extra packages will be listed , which make working with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. R@@ PM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; a playlist window contains multiple browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running tex@@ tual indication that displays the current piece or current stream . just below is the area that displays the current piece or the current stream . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red game time to the remaining playing time of the piece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can switch through the available Analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the Player window . press d on your keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the PL and E@@ Q buttons also feature the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or the volume . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classical to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the E@@ Q button in the player window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the amount of functions be deter@@ red ; they are all easy to use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main sections , on the left is the navigation area . in the navigation area you can find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have previously used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , you might notice that the information displayed there are now collected in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first area in this sub@@ window shows information about the piece . the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you will see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . see here , how often and when the play was played for the first and last time , as well as its rating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on any of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the selected pieces , there are the favourite pieces of this artist . this section shows the top rated pieces of the current artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can choose which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window , right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the content of the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in each area to start playing right away . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this function is very flexible and it is possible to download scripts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . if there is no text script running , you can choose which script should be started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database , so no running text script is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - only grouped the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - first the pieces are arranged according to performer , and this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be displayed at the beginning of the list under various interpre@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Jahr - album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically , and the performer is ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces will first be sorted by genre , including by performer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group@@ ing genre / interpreter / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing as you wish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; will automatically capture your collection once you have a lot of pieces , it might take a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a search filter is located directly below the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . for the use of this filter , see the section on the playlist in this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can choose between different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours up to one year . you can also select your entire collection from the last 24 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

all pieces of this interpreter burn / Bur@@ n CD - thus the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed this option is not displayed .

the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection , which have never been played . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Media Player sub@@ window will be used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you will need to find the pieces on your iPod according to artist sorted in the top list view of the Media Player Browser .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drag them to the list interpreter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the tool@@ bar is a search area where you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files will be hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file @-@ browser there is an address bar with which you can input music from a entered URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press the input button you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult due to simple drop . in that case the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list and not on the mouse position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you enter separate search terms by spaces , search &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; search for entries which contain all search terms . if you enter one two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces will be found containing one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to search for entries containing spaces , enter the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for bigger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to search for a piece that doesn &apos;t contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can combine these syntax variations at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this looks for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order click on the entries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a disk with a corresponding CD / DVD was selected in the folder view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head bar is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ board has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this opens a dialog box to change key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key mapping to the bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will start k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows the proper per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrators need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general programming settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is intended for person@@ al@@ ising and adjusting the program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled by example via a shell script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the D@@ CO@@ P command line or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this chapter we assume that you can use the command line D@@ CO@@ P . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , which all &amp; k@@ de ; program have common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features for creating new projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f Cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f Cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f Cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f Cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void ) bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void of bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b - K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can get a project from the command line using # D@@ CO@@ P k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void add@@ pri@@ l ( Q@@ String name ) void add@@ res@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Path ) void pass@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void or FAL@@ SE ( Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&amp; video creator ; is an audio CD ; read for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible depending on the en@@ coder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many encoding producers which en@@ code these wa@@ v files ( compression ) . other en@@ co@@ ders are currently being added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it has to be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ able ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ ders have already been installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about coding , audio quality and compression factors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a word for copying protected audio CDs ; s : as already said , uses &amp; audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog may be called up to a suitable configuration ) , it will later be used to understand the slim approach of the user interface that you often stum@@ ble across at the beginning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; convert into many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ ver programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can &amp; CD ; fetch information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without network , all manually captured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only a short list of commands of the main window . on the page step by step , you will find further information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ DD@@ B request the CD data according to the creation of request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start reading and - if a en@@ coder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup directory , encoding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder as the default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the file manager , so that an already selected file will be selected , rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , pi@@ p@@ ses ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; terminated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the main dialogue dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as en@@ coder , for setting up the en@@ coder ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ effici@@ ents and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if no audio information is lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ GG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in Audio Quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ b@@ ps ) , but the differences are less important since both co@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ nt so &apos; free , lame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; + High to very high sound quality ( with high bit rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG recordings exists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices like standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ b@@ ps V@@ BR . compression rate up to 6.@@ 3 . requires up to 320 k@@ b@@ ps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ b@@ ps C@@ BR ; compression rate app 5.5 . uses always 256 k@@ b@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ b@@ ps C@@ BR stereo , compression rate app . 11 . 128 k@@ b@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music by young people , portable devices and car stere@@ ograms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ b@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality , then choose this setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information which manually entered or retri@@ eved by the program from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be handed over / used with &amp; video creator ; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of programming settings for the co@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the encoding indicate the switch for these programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s is en@@ coded with lame the switch -@@ t@@ t of lame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; video creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all the others can download this information instead of themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , it should be legal , but I am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from downloading information publicly available on the &amp; CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this type of configuration , it appears that the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( but only the programmer knows who has checked the code . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; Audio@@ creator is set up ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally placed mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the computers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval from &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly created ) only the updates of the database .
which read@@ out program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used , who wants to know more exactly , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed if this is not yet done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to save the read WAV files , the encoding and the desired file format can be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for first opening , pre @-@ defined values for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C can be added on the tab to set up the encoding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ko@@ di@@ ver package has to be installed by the dedicated Linux distribution , before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined co@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installing a coding , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , writing and reading real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio coding of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , flat &amp; etc ; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check , if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the shell of the CD ; this will not succeed ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you are using other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up the program that makes the program exactly what you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use lame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) of 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ b@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has to be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already installed on your computer . for example , both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists , and that you own write permission on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first section deals with basic set @-@ up of &amp; video creator ; something that is probably done only once , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; , which needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here we determine the encoding of the comp@@ iler for compression of the music ( lame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 up to 256 k@@ b@@ ps ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any reading of a &amp; CD ; if the right settings are found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the device name is passed to the reading program , so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your disk . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the / etc / f@@ stab file can be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card card General Settings . here &apos;s not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is loaded / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just ask for incomplete information , so that you will be informed when information on generating keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the card card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator via the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : while reading the &amp; CD , the computer must be connected to the Internet so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second selection box is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from this , please note : if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used . however , you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ DD@@ B is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data request to retrieve the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b @-@ server on the Internet . how does the system know which data the CD should be received ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . do everything in the same way as shown in the screen@@ shot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ DD@@ B server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls are bo@@ cking the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there is probably more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this example , we do not want to transfer data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; number at the same time : ap@@ ologies , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author does not know , therefore simply try . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to e@@ ject the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then the path / folder can be specified in which the WAV files are stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be made to the right to see everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier this is a setting for very good audio quality even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is 6.@@ 3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest like in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; number of WAV files at the same time : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic set up of &amp; video creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this section is described how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure that is organized in the previous section is described and set up . first a connection to the Internet is structured as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section has to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD ; which is not contained in fre@@ ed@@ b the screen@@ shots look a bit different from the data fet@@ ched for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; instead of retri@@ eving data from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
do not try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is not done yet , the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the disk that has been defined in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length in the window should be listed as in the screen@@ shot . this is only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this does not happen , then search the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section for help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully retri@@ eved from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD , a window will pop up and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not have the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e 1.2 , Step 2 : the CD Editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ les &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist no longer has to be entered in the field &apos; Ac@@ tual title &apos; , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments of each piece , the commentary volume of the album is used for comments which apply together for all pieces of the CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attention : after the successful recall of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. if all words are upper@@ case or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tags are not supported by all encoding and file formats . in the help of the en@@ coder , see how to get more information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information , go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example can be found under Rock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD Editor &apos;s window will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album have already been filled with the entered data . just enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the next line in the main window , and enter the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attention : this window does not appear , if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the piece list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . simply click on the line to select the piece , or select the Select All pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the selection process has been selected by clicking on the selection process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the window for checking orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window , in the status bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this error message will see if you are trying to work with a sha@@ ver , which you have not yet installed . pieces which have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the order 1 reads the first piece . but we have a new entry : assignment # 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this means reading and encoding in parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window ; it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found any configuration options to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that appears to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . the used machine with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous reading and encoding ( of course two different pieces ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order in the queue is coded . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . and 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the coding of your choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; video creator ; most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; video creator ; most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section is aimed at people compiled by source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs , once it is running , then the following is correct for you : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a program that calls many different programs has many variations on settings . best read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different tabs of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , still am reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any point of reference ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start ) or from the unusually short menu ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is it about ? if you are reading this , probably the program has already started . it should look like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is considered to be the first version for a manual to &amp; video creator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strange if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need that information , but ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ aoke @-@ esp@@ iel@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US maps . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by up@@ lifting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window on k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it will appear the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid , window . this also works with several songs simultaneously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu piece or press the space bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played consec@@ u@@ tively . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as you play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the knob . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the template to change the speed . to restore the original tempo , double @-@ click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button pause or select the menu entry break in the menu piece , interrup@@ ts playback . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event ; others use lyrics event and other both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined which uses a song so you don &apos;t have to manually set the entry automatic text selection . you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to set an event type , select the entries for text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also includes keys 1 and 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze . in this section , you will find how to use collections efficiently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... click New and enter the name for the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired change in the collection manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the temporary collection , all the songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you leave the application , this collection will not be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button Add a song . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a second method to add a song , depends on the setting automatic addition to the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece will automatically be added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when a piece is opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and select the song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they have been added to the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is set new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play a song , select it from the collection manager , or use the selection list above the Kar@@ aoke text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to skip a song , select the next song &apos;s next song , select next song from the menu piece or press the arrow to the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to jump back a song , select the button Pre@@ y piece , the entry Previous piece from the menu piece or press the arrow left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not play a role as it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events translate into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that transforms all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano events in the events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards GM are compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US maps , FM devices and so on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a MIDI map is a text file , which stores all the required translations for playing a piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each section must appear only once , except the Key@@ map section which may appear as many times as desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ ONS ... EN@@ D
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you see that default is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ ONS ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please send me your map as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this section , you specify how the patches from General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ ator is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also no row for one of the 128 instruments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard for example does not support a ri@@ fle ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , you can use the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( fire@@ wall ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that here with the term &quot; drum patch &quot; the patch is meant to represent another percussion instrument ( drums , pel@@ vis , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound is the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are displayed on a particular channel or instrument , and the use is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel , each instrument . you just have to use different names in the first line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; key@@ maps are mainly used to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel , for example , look at the provided key@@ maps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and the second channel , make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 rows , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , the keyboard must be re@@ defined with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is calculated in which ratio P@@ itch Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch nam@@ ing event with the value n , this will be used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is needed because GM is pres@@ iding to play a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , try some key@@ boards to find the right value on your keyboard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use a MIDI map , just open the MIDI Settings dialog . this can be found in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards , you see which sounds are being played . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel view has two different views to display the played notes . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the Channel View menu : settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pace LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow down it . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that &apos;s because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support you need to download and install a source distribution ( e.g. from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can press the arrow key to the left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI @-@ Fol@@ der and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or go ( when I play a kar@@ aoke file ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn off the automatic addition to the collection , and the new file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then decide to play B@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you so much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , I encourage you to go further to &amp; k@@ mid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I &apos;m doing programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you really make me a huge joy when sending me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all that send me a postcard or a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid , completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anyone . I would like to emphasize that I am only getting feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high at AW@@ E cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Mr. Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul WIT@@ TA , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ st , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error alert or even a supporting email . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and of course , my thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us this wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to this can be found on his website which is found in ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs and / etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you could have a sound card except that you can of course not hear music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet , and was installed on this machine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE site to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . and finally , there is a window with the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the Book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Last@@ ly Play@@ list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical level . when you register an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the reproduction starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p / p file can be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after changing XML files , you have to select the same with playlist and select either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all changes are lost when you leave the processing mode , or select another group without using the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 % option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can be inserted simply .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animation during boot does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening a different source . this would be annoying at the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ;
there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the memory size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer visible .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manually editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c file . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even embed the custom field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
thus the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages ; module as service provider for the Mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE must be stated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is to be checked inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , this must be done by manually changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c file . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , using either M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before watching TV , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to configure the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; VD@@ R@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be detected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the V@@ DR support can only be used by K@@ M@@ Player , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one ) . this is why the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internally , various names are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there any clu@@ e how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter , if I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to be run as a user root after the device is connected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU need to be tested for its performance every time ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional scrip@@ ting application . among Unix @-@ like systems , probably the package &amp; ly@@ live ; or / tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of these components may be included in the &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD / DVD should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; ki@@ le ; Project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable simple installation without further comp@@ iling , and are included on the ki@@ le ; website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation are considered . if the support for this project or its documentation is requested , the contact via the ki@@ le must be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have any questions or if you wish to compile &amp; ki@@ le , please contact us on the mailing list ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; ki@@ le ; provides the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to find out more about &amp; brands ; and to know its ways , the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter Working with the Editor of Po@@ sters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for &amp; latex ; is the correct pron@@ ou@@ che : La@@ y @-@ Tech . while the prim@@ eval &amp; tex ; difficult to use it can also use a La@@ ie ( English lay ) &amp; latex ; a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while here only a good overview of &amp; latex is given , it is not the ultimate book there@@ for . to be able to rule properly , good books e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ &apos; class , the body starts with the command \ \ &apos; { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ &apos; { document } . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Quick Con@@ figuration Wiz@@ ard of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for quick preparation of a document in &amp; box ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some options for the creation of the document .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document Cl@@ asses : this refers to the kind of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , film &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom defined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coding : this is used to set the character encoding . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; latex ; -@@ documents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; latex ; for the integration , they only have to be selected in the check box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Let@@ ter ( DIN ) : the Docum@@ ents of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new users no longer need to worry , just a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; it offers - just like other source code editors - the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as inappropriate ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when setting up a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; ki@@ le , automatically create an empty line ( e.g. \ \ } { command } ) . this function can be til@@ ted in the menu Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands can be disabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all documents are usually divided into some elements , and latex ; gives the document sub@@ division into the following elements ( it is the highest and sub @-@ structured element ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of a mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful , as soon as a DVI @-@ file is created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a DVI @-@ file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as font and is in addition to PDF the commercial output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing of DVI ; files for various systems and devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when searching for a button , the elements of the DVI @-@ file are cli@@ cked with the Editor and as soon as an element in the DVI file has been cli@@ cked , the previous search is the exact opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
master @-@ Docum@@ ent : this function is used when working with several files . a master document simpli@@ fies work with other .@@ tex files . a project @-@ wide Master document can be set to project settings when using a project .
fast construction : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI @-@ file becomes a n@@ der@@ less â &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when viewing the tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be drawn up . the selection fields have been developed for quick integration of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for quick integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the further selection box is for inser@@ ting articles such as tags , feet notes or links . the possibilities available are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; name : with this command a name for a section , an image or other element is created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection above a selection field possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ E is used for defining the font size . the font sizes can be specified for the main text , the joint notes , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when calling &amp; ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document may be written from scratch by hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brackets after the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font size . if the font size is not set at the beginning , it can also be done in the text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the source code example has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the men@@ Ã ¼ s construction or the quick @-@ build button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le , for automatic storage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the compilation of the document should be searched for errors . when using quick @-@ build , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be automatically started . if this is not the case , the logging should also be noted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 will be created and only a few characters should have a different font size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the changes are only secured within the environment ( by \ \ &apos; { environment } to \ \ &apos; { environment } ) , there is no restrictions ( number ) for the changes within an environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many options to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold print , ital@@ ics , etc . , can be added either with the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the itali@@ an print and is available until it is closed with an \ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in one sentence can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ &apos; { word } .
\ \ quota : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ start { quota } and ends with \ \ &apos; { quota } .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; latex , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; box is followed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the wizard has been entered a bit of text , a few adap@@ tations for the better read@@ ability of the document should be executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the document has been viewed , editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( with the internal viewer ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the DVI file was created , the document can be printed out or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ance ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as Prin@@ ter &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , you can print the document ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bar allows the transformation of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI @-@ file is created from the &amp; latex ; source text , the conversion can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the related position inside the DVI , file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; provides an appropriate setting for all &amp; latex ; file files . to do this , only modern under Settings box has to be set up ... tools building can be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to perform the pre @-@ search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then click on pre @-@ search stream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; latex ; file and jump to the corresponding line . for this you have to set up &amp; ki@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set up as text editor ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should a mistake exist , this is reported in the documentation file or in the message window in summary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the log file er@@ ects the source code source code . in the editor you can select the Pre@@ diction La@@ Te@@ X errors and the latest La@@ Te@@ X errors for jumps between the errors . the log file will always be cli@@ cked on the error in the log and &amp; ki@@ le ; ski@@ ps to er@@ ron@@ eous line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you click on the button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template you are using for the document . the default options are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when selecting a document , a document can either be re@@ written or used for the quick creation of a new document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be created , stored and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file may be opened or a new file can be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating a new document from a new document , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings ... Settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings will be replaced by which variables : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { items } .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps must be taken : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating a new document , your own template can be selected instead of the standard size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files created in a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described under described steps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; box ; used and makes ; as internal editor . &amp; Plac@@ ards ; is a text editor for programmers with the ability to read and extract from many different kinds of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to find out more about it , and to find its ways , the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter Working with the Editor of Po@@ sters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides a very practical and latex ; command reference which can be called to the Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be used in &amp; latex ; usage can be found as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that when clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ par . only \ \ par is selected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when dra@@ gging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the Editor window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and to emphasize this . for example , the &amp; latex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ ae are distinguished by a different color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many assistants can capture additional jumps . this is a separate type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu entries , boun@@ ce marks or the corresponding ke@@ yst@@ ers are highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted during the first input of a sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; although &amp; posters ; already excellent facilities have been added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; particular commands for their selection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; add a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this selection has also an extended meaning , since this command also has an extended meaning , as this command also contains &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with an additional spann@@ er ( * ) and an additional star ( * ) is selected at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while removing part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; K with its own commands for faster possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le , is included in the description to edit boxes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore &amp; ki@@ le ; for that reason &amp; ki@@ le ; for more commands under the editing environment for one possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this command will jump to the start of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed right in front of the command to open the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or inside the command \ \ begin { environment } , it is spra@@ yed at the end of the area ( or vice versa ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , you can quickly get lost . this command closes the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted ambient structure is not destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups which are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the editing environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this command will jump to the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cur@@ sor will be placed right in front of the open bracket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded clamp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or behind the cur@@ ly clamp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering many ne@@ sted groups of brackets you can quickly get lost . this command closes the most recently opened group , so the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the practical implementation it is used in &amp; box ; the sign is &quot; used . &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; knows this case and supports two connecting characters for &amp; latex , one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this automatic entry of the double entry token can be set up under Settings , ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be used in specific settings ( e.g. , for example , or French ) , and there@@ with German or French suits . there are also many other languages available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when choosing Shift , En@@ ter &amp; tilt ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , it is not only a line break but also the command \ \ item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
close the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be adjusted under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X can be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some users want to classi@@ fy the columns in tables -@@ environments and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) . if this tab is not the same , add &amp; tilt ; add some space for the columns to the current tab . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is a good source code completion , it has been added to &amp; ki@@ le ; three of them work on demand and the other two are configured for automatic execution . all of these modes can be configured for different working modes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ &apos; { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while pushing the touch button , the last letter of the input is removed and the list gets corrupted . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command . alternatively , jump tok@@ ens can be inserted , so that a jump to these positions is possible and the selected parameters can then be inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Settings box , set up ... ki@@ le ; all possible settings can be made to these lists . there can be different opinion lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ orders as well as to general language use can be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command mode is not necessary for the execution of environments . you will always have to enter a few letters with \ \ begin , and the default setting will be used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for the integrity of environments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command to open the environment automatically opens and it appears \ \ begin . after that , the environment can be continued by pressing the input button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; recognizes that this is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
settings can be set ; set up ... ki@@ le ; you can modify settings to these lists . this mode uses the list of drop@@ outs for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; - commands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; box ; supports user @-@ defined lists of changes that are immediately replaced by default strings . for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the file L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the character L is entered and the word L \ \ La@@ Te@@ X replaces the word processing mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large e walls are not helpful for automatic trans@@ mitting . however , it has been noted that many buyers are written more than once in a document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this mode can be set up in the menu box ... Ke@@ ep down boxes completely . here , the threshold for displaying the case can also be specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most complete files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Graphi@@ cs dialog displays graphics as simple as possible . to review the basics for graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and re @-@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be able to review the results of the work , you must compile the source code . all construction tools are grouped together in the contents of Cre@@ ating , Cre@@ ating and Cre@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by Alt ; 3 , by old ; 4 the DVI ; file converted to a PS file and be viewed by old ; 5 the PS file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using the Quick Building command , a viewer is normally called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will be opened each time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new project will be on the Men@@ Ã ¼ Projekt Promoti@@ ons project .... At the same time , the following information will be asked for the project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when selecting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ob@@ r project file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Script function of &amp; ki@@ le , allows the exec@@ uting of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed via scripts in the vertical bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the API scripts are not yet developed , and can be found in other versions of &amp; ki@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you have to say that the scrip@@ ting environment of the scripts in &amp; box ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) has the following methods : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; latex ; is a quite sophisticated system , where the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ live ; they are supplied with many documents , including a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; latex ; reference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; latex ; as this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all documents are divided into categories , and the advantage is the search for package names or keywords . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double @-@ click with the mouse or the space button , opens the viewer for the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using the command line interface , you can create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for random signatures , any signature from the signature file will be read from the Sig@@ nature File . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for daily signatures , the same signature is made from the signature file from &amp; C@@ sig . for each day , use different signatures , such as the random signatures you create unique emails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to create a new signature choose C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you an lt ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . and add your new signature in the signing section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can create as many signatures as you like . then , you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it in the File &gt; Rem@@ ove or click the symbol with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case you can select Quick commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use &amp; k@@ ew ; 3.5 is required . to app@@ end signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature from the output of a command . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all call stack elements are listed here . the older the stack entry is , the lower its frame number . see the example below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking on a call stack entry in the shown list , the cur@@ sor will be placed in the main window to the corresponding line number of the corresponding file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has worked out for me and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! simply click the icon for the XML processor and finished ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this application is expected to be a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the binary working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time I think pro@@ c is started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now there is a great graphical interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the newly opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply leave the current job folder . if not , then select the current job folder and enter the folder where the inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it comes to output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the errors and try again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the file to be checked is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if not , delete the file with the current file and select the file to be reviewed with other file - file selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed Veri@@ fication selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML file ; ( External ) and DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG check is the specification of definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the file to be processing in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us is already selected , then you can simply select the current file . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed using the other file file selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should have named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plug @-@ ins , the plug @-@ ins , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this allows the plug @-@ in system to benefit immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start editing plug @-@ ins . this opens the following dialog : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dialog allows you to manage all contained plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each and GUI , element in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , this path to search plug @-@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people often work on a project in a hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the names and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves as a clear identification .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one member may have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the user can select himself from the list of team members who he is . this is done by searching the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their own ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and setting of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for further information on notes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see for more information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something happens in the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing of a project , or sending a message when a file is backed up to the CVS repository , or a script that will add a file to the CVS repository . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the site Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog can be created , edited and deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
ann@@ ot@@ ations are simple . either the comment entry from the editor @-@ contex@@ tual menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text can be entered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) plays a role in the project of the following possibilities : team leader sub @-@ project leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around brackets and : make the note invalid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , the DT@@ D agnos@@ tic is supported and web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings can be accessed via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over several pages , which are treated consec@@ u@@ tively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion , can be changed . the entries are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big / in@@ sensitive tags : large / in@@ sensitive of automatically added tags . normal sized / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are past@@ ed as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case @-@ sensitive attributes . normal sized / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; optional tags automatically include : when checked , for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after the &amp; quot ; inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not optional tags automatically rule : as above for all other tags , with the exception of simple tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatically update start and finish tag : when switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic setting of accent marks : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters , in the appropriate coding during insertion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect various types of files . using button default , the standard specifications can be restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or in any other way than with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . but this setting is checked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not detected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regular backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash when the program is started , the document will be restored periodically according to the set time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor section or in your own view ( or documentation in a cart@@ on ) , making it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source text at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
set the default window settings back to the standard at the next start is useful if the user interface has per@@ ched through changing the M@@ DI modes and / or depen@@ ded on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the warning message area is used to control the display of warning messages , by enabling no more requests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the place to change behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set to change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in split mode . see the different modes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the representation of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of mouse click on the structure tree , it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structural tree with the mouse buttons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empty knots are the empty spaces in the text , whereas empty groups are the empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abbrevi@@ ations are grouped into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plug @-@ ins are part applications of third party that can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; address : the path to the plugin , if it is not on a standard as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; input : this information will pass the plugin from the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; load component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Read Only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct , even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gger has been completely re@@ developed . the support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been implemented , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . the button options next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plug @-@ in drop @-@ down sel@@ ector can be modified to change the specific settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view , in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . normally appears in the left dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view , in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . normally appears in the lower dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view , in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . normally appears in the lower dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this action will trigger the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or it shares the plugin to listen to de@@ bu@@ gger . this action is usually executed when a project is opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the equivalent to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
send an HTTP request to the server to launch a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ u@@ gger output .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assign the de@@ bu@@ gger to start the execution of the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables , as well as the current executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution starts with the request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assign the de@@ bu@@ gger to start the execution of the script , without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution starts when a request is made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , without entering into the functions or include . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include , will be corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assign the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement , and go to the next as if there is no current one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialog , where a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the vari@@ abl@@ en@@ view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this dialog , you can enter a variable or set a new value to a variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale and this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find in ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many more works of Keith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs , and how you can help you get better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
document type edit packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers . easy to use and productive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tag Fol@@ der contains two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag file contains two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag file contains two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag file contains two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this document describes how tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tag@@ XML Files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information on the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a write error .
tag Fol@@ ders are nothing but folders . they contain only the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag file names the name of the description language and version . ( for example : html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares if they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better view and more information at work with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations will be explained in a simple way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only happen once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but the element type about itself otherwise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only for Type Vali@@ d . speci@@ fies the name of the class , where this method belongs . ( only family 2 ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag . ( only family 1 ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
set a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a merely element type element .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; describe an attribute of a tag . this element can only happen once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags describing how this attribute is to be shown &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speci@@ fies the source code used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog , and in the attribute tree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P . the D@@ CO@@ P interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P and the name of an interface . the D@@ CO@@ P method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; requires source = D@@ CO@@ P , a cut and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , meaning the name of the current tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tag that summari@@ zes the elements of a list , it can only happen for an attribute description . it is a single element type element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
specify the position of the attribute of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
indicates the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be available for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined , and this element is a type element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; declaration start : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ atly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spaces should be replaced by &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; can be sub@@ stituted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , whose simple instructions follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this function is currently not available . currently , the check only takes place when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the following example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this tag XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following example , for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this tag XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = = &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor to be able to edit DT@@ D settings . for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; a simple &amp; descrip@@ tional r@@ c should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = sol@@ sti@@ ce 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as nick@@ name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an action can be set with Settings ... to create actions , click New action to create the same dialog : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the User defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer the current key short@@ cut can be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when performing the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not restricted ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : sh / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Home / my@@ Home / my@@ Home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; % f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if done by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs the text will be unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the external script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us can be used to accept the standard input . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the output of the executed application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New action button at the bottom of the window , starts editing mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fill out all necessary fields , and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; Day Edit &quot; when available so that input when using the action is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ig@@ ou@@ em ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it , before we have trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ strain . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ cs Other Program@@ s ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ strain ; uses 32 x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size to others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that the created symbol will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least one message to the user indicate that clicking this icon will be inserted ; tag in the current document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after creating the symbol it must still be associated with the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the folder in which the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; press the Application button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions for tool@@ bar , or you should set them to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting the element , which should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , I want a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note how the Tren@@ to support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by absorbing all the symbols , ensuring that everything works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in the right folder . after New@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the proper folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if someone has done it for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for format@@ ting / scripts / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ph@@ p@@ 42 / Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the &amp; PHP documentation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents ; # User Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = basic syntax
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently , at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
spaces do not affect anything but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files will be replaced .
the contents section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file that is used to figure the context @-@ sensitive help . for example when writing a &amp; PHP ; script can display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text List ) and the file connection lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a simple list of shared context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can save your do@@ cr@@ c file just after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / do@@ c or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / do@@ c for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specify it in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information such as which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the missing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . in different places , you can send an email to the tool@@ bar DT@@ D ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us users can download them . to make a hard contribution we recommend to sign the resources , for which there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when up@@ loading you are asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can fill out the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and then click OK to start loading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) tool@@ bar and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , check &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears indicating the resource of the resource . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in tag XML format might be needed . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definition line : the string that is in ! Doc@@ type tag like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ editor with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you must first famili@@ arise yourself with these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; everything that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this enables administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in a global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only be used in person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be all from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most restric@@ tive size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some major areas : the editor window , the tree views , the tabs with information and the tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can click on the right mouse button to get a contex@@ tual menu with the current document , re@@ charge , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or run CVS commands to the current document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right @-@ click in the editor section leads to another context menu regarding the edited document contents as basic editing steps ( cutting / copying / past@@ ing ) to edit the file under the mouse cur@@ sor or opening the file if the string under the mouse poin@@ ter den@@ otes a file .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . at present &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; P@@ GT , then click the tag that represents the tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us makes it possible to navigate , open and ro@@ am . in the presentation with tabs , files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project Management is a powerful tool that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us provides . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be performed with the contex@@ tual menu displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are only usable for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be found in the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of breakdown in Global , Local and Project functions here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information about a script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking of an element a list of commands will be displayed regarding navigation and refres@@ her the tree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tree appears among the other buildings . it can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it , allowing the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site you can create your own documentation and by adding a folder do@@ c to a project can be edited and edited project @-@ specific documentation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tabs at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information window and the problem window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tab shows all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts which are executed , enter all error messages ( as there are ) in this window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensive expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the option to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar Archive by &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email they can save and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us files on your system . therefore , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have problems while starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of your bin folder . the same is true for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should be the appropriate &amp; IDE . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can dramatically increase productivity . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can increase dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development , and has been expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more in the detailed documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; input , or help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as M@@ anti@@ a am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . each time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry will be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when inser@@ ting from cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters for &amp; HTML ; -@@ en@@ roll@@ ment , so they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
convert the text from cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; writing which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn out the block selection , which allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very useful , if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages out ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; display the message window or not . this is the window , in which you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
training and switching on the problem @-@ porters at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you change to the structure tree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; displays the symbol column on the left of the main window , which allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries of Pre@@ cious or Next , depending on the cur@@ sor position in the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . then , the selected files will be copied to the project directory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; search the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , for example , to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub @-@ folders and then add them to the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available methods of transport depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded other input / output modules ( Ki@@ o slaves ) .
settings how &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects you will find the details explained .
load a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar , local or project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only generates the name . actions need to be added by setting actions ... or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps at the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows the upload of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access them . see in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; which you or anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; charging / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder fails , the load fails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tag menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insertion of tags . currently this works only with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by tool bar is denied if this tag in this place contradic@@ ts the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu items listed above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ edi@@ fying schem@@ ata depends on the makes ; -@@ version .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the type of line indicator . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes take time or cause un@@ nice graphics . the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; switches the status bar on the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , main window on or off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the changes in this dialog influence any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judge the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Po@@ sters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will find details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or add them and modify the sequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should generate a help according to the mouse cur@@ sor &apos;s environment , but is not implemented yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled with the whole directory structure for the rest of the project , e.g. after completing the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you will find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you leave this field blank , the default settings of the selected log are used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment might be necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default , if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default , tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project , and multiple files or entire folders can be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ha@@ unted , if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is starting from scratch , do not touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an accurate selection according to coup@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want by clicking on or , by removing the tick , check out the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded from the menu with project @-@ properties in the menu @-@ tree in the sub@@ window profiles or modified with the key Shift ; F@@ 7 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some settings correspond to those in the project wizard , and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders ) , which will be re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; supplementary options to the above , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read in more about project views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows you to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ u@@ gger plug @-@ in can be configured with the options button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sub @-@ window profiles high load profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by pointing an own tree view for each profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event configuration may include event actions and add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to open another project , select Project Open Project ... from the Project or the Symbol Project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog Project will open and allow the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files will happen . the same happens when you load a new project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project , where the files can be managed in the current project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the context menu on the right mouse button : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows you to remove the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will be f@@ aded to prevent removing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the password will be kept in the main memory and forgotten by programmers . this option is useful if frequent upload of files is necessary , and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk will not be asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will stop the transfer , or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high loading profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed Ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on your wave of fear , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted in the Project tool@@ bar menu or the project tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own working method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best over the tool@@ bar menu . use and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars is discussed below in the Add tool bar section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bar and the symbols on it can be set either through context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the tool@@ bar ) , where new action , a new tool@@ bar can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog where actions on these or other tool@@ bars should be visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action processed which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu , and set their settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets , and files to link . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations you set up for the file system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the terms outlined at the beginning of each template , before use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
binary is everything that is not pur@@ er text . it can be any file except text ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually added in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; documents can be created from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is always included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . see the template tree for more information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; create a document structure after exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As a template Save As Local Tem@@ plate ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once this has been done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select text in your document and click File as Tem@@ plate to save as a local / project template . alternatively , you can simply drag and drop templates to the tree view templates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can be used to use all file management functions , such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or project files , enter a name for the template and backup . by default , it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented procedure . you can forward he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or link dynamically with &amp; PHP ; you can design , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to specify the behaviour of a folder , click the folder table with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is enabled by default and does everything except the root folders in the template . if a root folder is set up , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
allows previous or updated text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and enables a whole presentation to be equipped with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers for a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you have the context menu ( pointing the right mouse button ) via a complete command line for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be accessed from the View menu . the first mode replaces the editor window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; code editor . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second mode works exactly like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via Settings Qu@@ anta . you can automatically select between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatic . in principle the recommendation is : a small span for quick calcul@@ ator and a large pot for slow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; the documentation properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL is created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows the change of the contents ( e.g. keywords on the column names and keyword keyword 2 on the content column ) .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . editing CSS rules is currently not supported yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to include an external CSS style template , pressing the file @-@ open button and select the appropriate file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cur@@ sor is like in a text processing , by moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual . text can be inserted by typing and dropping using button or distance paste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way through the tool@@ bars , as in the source editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags in previous identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed by any other anchor tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some tool@@ bars like the table wizard or the Listen @-@ Wiz@@ ard are disabled . later , they will work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists need to be used tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be followed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to compile and successfully comp@@ iling the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a default name named QNAP or a given model name is checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a question@@ able holding point must be dis@@ b@@ anded for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when the first template is loaded using x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each run .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activ@@ ates the X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input document , if the support for this is enabled in lib@@ x@@ ml . this is turned on as default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on systems with an installed re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll down the arrow keys to the previously executed commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass compound expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : using the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument is set a stop in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template containing only ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a completely qualified name like x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name .
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local file name on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ win systems the name can have the Pre@@ fix ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . on R@@ IS@@ C @-@ OS systems other environment variables are also allowed .
P@@ AT@@ H : a path to change the work@@ folder . on some operating systems the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; will be replaced by the path to your personal folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data : the XML data or the XML _ document , which is processed by the style template . see also &amp; lt ; FI@@ LE@@ NA@@ ME@@ TER ; &amp; lt ; U@@ RI@@ M2 ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; run time commands : pass _ BA@@ R _ exit _ BA@@ R _ quit , step , step up , step down , next , continue , run , trace , set@@ back , options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many graphical tools for comparing , so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ? let me briefly explain why I wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time changed the ind@@ entation in many places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program that I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no hint at the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , lots of other useful features were added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a function that made a lot of work was the same and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also 3 @-@ way merging is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of each other on one piece of co@@ de and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result . the screen shot shows three source files when merging :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you comparing and merging complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , in the folder merging : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and refers to the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible . if rows differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a file is equal and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all files have the same name but in different folders , you can ease the typing work by writing only the file name of the first file . example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folder 1 , folder 1 folder 2 , folder 1 folder 2 , folder 1 folder 2 , folder 1 folder 2 , folder 1 folder 2 folders 3 -@@ o target folders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open dialog allows you to manually type fil@@ en@@ ame , select from the file browser ( file ... ) or select a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the folder folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merging of folders will be initiated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if merging is enabled , the input field becomes active for target and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily necessary to immediately set an output file . you can do this step later when saving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Set@@ ting button opens a dialog with settings . here , you can set options before starting with the same / merging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only to compare parts of a text . the comparison starts immediately . you don &apos;t have to select files from the cli@@ p@@ board . you can simply close the dialog with the break button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use drag and drop down , simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , it would have been a relatively big effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : at present , you cannot pull out anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data might be lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the upper part of each text window , the Info line contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( if the path is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these default settings can be changed via the settings menu . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a difference is recognized , you can see the color of the file . if both files differ , the default colour is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in rare cases . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vertical line , which separates the merge column from the text , is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line breaks are enabled , the line is dotted with broken lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result window ( below the comparison window ) also has an Info line with the inscription output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; change &#93; when you edit the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! ! ! until all the conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to find the remaining dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference must also be resolved manually at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you change your mind and maybe select another source . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a mark that you may copy and insert somewhere else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the text &amp; lt ; implementation conflicts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : when selecting the sources , ignore the numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; navigate mainly to scroll bars and mouse , but you can also use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on the left , end , C@@ tr@@ l end and C@@ tr@@ l end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Au@@ ction window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using the button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insertion mode . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a click with the left mouse button in one of the column columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the section , and the edi@@ table output window ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ image up@@ side / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to copy the selection to the cli@@ p@@ board , you will need to copy the option sel@@ ector automatically . if enabled , whatever you select is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; line end@@ ings are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use the drag line + line feed \ \ r \ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved when loading , and restored at the next start . ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you activate this option , differences are presented in ital@@ ics . if the chosen script does not support this representation , nothing happens at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be sc@@ ast@@ ert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this option is enabled , pressing the tab key will insert the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you press entry or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select which line type you prefer to save , the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second step compar@@ es each line . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a chari@@ ot drive &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then files with different sizes in page @-@ to @-@ side comparison look identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ sely search for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in automatic ski@@ pping mode , this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
solve automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white marks in many files are less important . note that the automatic selection includes conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or ignore C / C + + comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these options are discussed in the chapter for scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . for details , see Docum@@ entation for Directory Com@@ par@@ ison and merge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to exit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set there globally via the control centre . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the selection fields for encoding , a short notice of what the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are handled and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually configur@@ able even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used to save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
turn off this to supp@@ ress changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments enabled . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , you may see only the differences between two of three files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply send out the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide ab@@ rup@@ tly to merge the files . a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as pre @-@ set names for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge operation then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when reading a file , it will first be given to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only with the line balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results , but most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines to convert into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically create strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you might like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for row keys . sed / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you might want to perform multiple replac@@ ements at one time . then , you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of sed you can also use something different e.g. per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ aller@@ dings in per@@ l some details are different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data after the normal pre@@ processor is maintained for viewing and merging , and the other operations only change the data that the line ab@@ duction algorithm sees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may accidentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders in recur@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; can simulate the merge , and shows the simulated changes without actually performing them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very similar to the comparison and merging of individual files , so you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no target folder has been specified , it uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merging . to start merging , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while reading the folder , you will inform a small message window about current progress . if you cancel scanning the folders , only the files that have been compared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when scanning the folder , it shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each file and folder that has been found during the scan , is displayed in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or double the arrow keys to the left / right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when double click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) , these types are possible : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as shown in the picture above , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of identical entries , the color is also identical , although the age of the entries varies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . at folders the age is irrelevant for its color .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. , if a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the synchron@@ ization mode is active , if only two folders and no explicit destination folder were specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees the visible file name for the output file only B ; copy &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if two folders are merged and select the option New File instead of merging , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while merging , one file will be processed after the other . the Status column shows how successful the merge operation was successful and other messages when something unexpected occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for deleted conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or O@@ dner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the associated actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : if you do not have a destination folder , then C is used as a target in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge mode , and for synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as a target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to merge all entries , select directory merge and continue in the list menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select action from the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message indicating the defective elements appears . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you merge all the entries , a dialog box will appear with the options Con@@ duct , Sim@@ ulate and C@@ anc@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose Sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen , without really making changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is required ( merge a single file ) , a merge window will open ( see the screen@@ shot ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are finished with a file , select another directory guide / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , a corresponding dialog appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you encounter an error , a message and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list see some error messages to help you choose the cause of the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if some entries have been merged individually , these entries will not be merged . even if the merging has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory merging with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not correspond to that pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be typ@@ ed more than one pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be typ@@ ed more than one pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ olog@@ ous generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see under info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a previous poin@@ ter marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be checked and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that the link contains a link to itself would lead to a loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crash@@ es . ) This option is turned off in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you compare large folders to a slow network , it might be faster to compare the chan@@ gel@@ ation date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to confi@@ ding the chan@@ gel@@ ation date . the files are considered to be identical if they are equal , e.g. when copying the chan@@ ges@@ et date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activate Synchron@@ ize mode when compared to two folders and no target folder has been specified . in this mode , the proposals to merge files are stored in both folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are differences instead of merging , copying the later file is proposed as action . ( this is considered in@@ secure because it is provided that the other file was not modified . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension is already existing , it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal merging of individual files , not just the merging of entire folders . this option is turned on in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the Fol@@ der @-@ merge view remains visible to merging single files ; you can disable the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can disable the main window in the window menu and switch between directory and text window between the two views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you probably prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , you can also merge a single file directly without having to merge the folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this status will , however , be lost if you re @-@ read the directory : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of Ki@@ o slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open files located on local or remote hosts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive , with a local folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a URL has another syntax , as local files and folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a path can be relative and / or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , they are always absolute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is always accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no way to process per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the date of change depart from the original . ( note the option of respecting the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main purpose of use is currently the differences viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start the K@@ Diff@@ 3 press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if it is used as a K@@ Part , the file name will be a patch file in the unified format . then the patch file will be deleted from the patch file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and preview the file from the context menu . note that this does not work if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 is executed as part , it supports only comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now there are comp@@ are ) already exists . furthermore the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool Collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by taking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or going to get it like that .
you have compiled the program from the sources and probably do not share the configure script to K@@ DE . in the default configure configure in / usr / local but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only the number of white characters is different , the lines are treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effort for this has been too big so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text another editor should be used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after removing text , suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be confusing and mis@@ directed the purpose . for this , please use a different editor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , please visit the homepage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can find a list of the latest changes in ht@@ t@@ p : / / diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file in the source package .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir sets the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any problems while comp@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only display differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also means that identical files will not be copied to the target folder . if the target folder does not already contain these files , it will be missing after merging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if the rows are already present ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in default , this option is disabled . distingu@@ ishing differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ spaces , change their size , finish it or move them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; motion is possible both inside a work area and on other working surfaces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context menu only depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background by &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears , if cli@@ cked on an application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; show the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is displayed together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , eg . 1 . desktop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty spaces are displayed to allow selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally leaves &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid it is possible to display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical row in a vertical row that is very good for displaying on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move the windows as icons or with their contents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , and then select switch sel@@ ector ... lets the dialog appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , this cannot be changed in dialog settings . but you can do this manually : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit , or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must register as user root and assign it to your system administrator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this application is interesting for different users : artists , web designers and people with visual impairment are interesting . this documentation is intended to include a complete manual for use of &amp; K@@ mag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly extended to include new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you &amp; K@@ mag ; launch a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following is the magni@@ fying pane . the image that appears in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an alternative , you can set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to avoid the mouse cur@@ sor displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in selection mode , you can adjust the selection box to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter into the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you also press the &amp; Shift key , or use the &amp; M@@ b ; you can move the selection box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection box . keep in mind that the upper left corner of the selection window stays firmly and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
start or stop the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose the update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this mode , a selection box is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and smaller , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use a magni@@ fier to zoom in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people of use : from research or artist to web designer or visual impairment .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor wa@@ its for a while on the same place . it is meant to help people who are involved in the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not done yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain arising when clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic auxiliary agents : the result can be different for each . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you stop the motion briefly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move the mouse , wait till the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . this way you can pull the pull at pressed mouse button . this way you can pull the pull at pressed mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this residence time must be stored at the end of the mouse movement , before the m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool displays a mouse click . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Intel@@ lig@@ ently moving is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting before it releases the mouse button again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads to a double click . these movements are being started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and enter the Ri@@ der . there is a slider sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is selected , it is started &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at the moment you start with &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; quot ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set back all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the button , the settings will reset after the last press release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in the event of sounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you should be aware of what spots a mouse click is without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not cause unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . but it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have removed the ball , you need to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent shift , it means that you can stop the operation by releasing the mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happens when you are using a m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , using another window manager and moving a window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solution for this problem is that you can even execute a mouse click . hereby , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset and you can continue working as usual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor in place where you want it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to use a keyboard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to work with the smart shift , but I do not manage to edit text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intelligent mind is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible in this way to copy and paste any other action where you want to move the mouse if you want pressed mouse button . here are some advice :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not use the intelligent move if you just start using the m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click at the end of the text area and press the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse click , so you know exactly when when moving the move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window , must be installed . this should already be the case in most cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and loudspeaker , and these are correctly set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button once the mouse cur@@ sor remains short . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and causing the an@@ thro@@ po@@ genic pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that a pulling process starts , before the mouse button is released . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with which silent users can let their computer speak for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth &quot; program , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the second page , select the standard text pass@@ book . from the text passages , you can often choose text passages without typing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the vocabulary for vocabulary . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition you can balance the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the vocabulary .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains a input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a running memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have mou@@ th@@ watering , enter the phrases that you want to hear in the input field . each spoken phrase is attached to the running memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the page word completion and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field of voice output input field , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field you specify the character encoding with which the text is passed to the language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders here : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ u language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for speech output . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a passage of text , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text passages text menu or in the box for text passages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the selection of instant message , the selected text passage is inserted directly and additionally inserted into the input memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the second selection box closing the editing window for text passages , you can determine if the text pass@@ book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save the book . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text pass@@ book will not be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vocabulary page contains a list of vocabulary books . in the main window , next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth shows a selection field if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with buttons on the right side of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by counting the assignment . additionally you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary in order to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they are to be wei@@ ghted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the bottom part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; add actions like new passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the order of text passages or passages of text can be changed by drag with the mouse to the new location , or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this will be used , otherwise the selected sections of the memory cache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , it will be used , otherwise the selected sections of the disk cache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the currently active set is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected phrases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is ordered by default via the editing pane directly below the menu bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow bar at the bottom of the main window with hints about the status of &amp; k@@ mouth is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably you did not enter the command for the voice output properly or not fully . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the card language output . ( see settings dialog for voice synthes@@ izer for more details . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to show an example of command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , to display the command line for the voice output command , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ eware . the voice output is then possible with one of the three command examples : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA under the assumption that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax often swal@@ lows up the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
keywords / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / local / usr / local / local / usr / local / local / usr / local / local / usr / local / local / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all parts of the command must be written in one line , and the option of sending data as default must be switched on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the voice output dem@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interface for speech output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since setting the language generator is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully using a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who can &apos;t speak text by the computer . it is stored a list of already spoken sentences , which the user can always recover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth doesn &apos;t contain a voice synthes@@ izer . a voice synthes@@ izer must be installed on the machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more detailed user documentation , help : / k@@ mouth ( either type this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; either or run the help center help : / k@@ mouth ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is a modules of existing service , which allows any application to read text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ programmers with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech output is made using the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hard Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
allows generation of voice output on command line ( or shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a module for the text editor and makes , with which a text file can be read completely or partly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the bu@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ lib@@ . the developers can also be found on the I@@ RC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org channel # k@@ de ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you can use it , you will need to install program support pat@@ cher and set correctly . see also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first launch of kt@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the card card will be displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card card will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different types of voice , synthes@@ izer , voice , gender , volume and speed are described as spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printers , for the same printer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click on the card leading speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card will be displayed automatically , if you start pun@@ ctu@@ m@@ gr and not yet set up a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all pre @-@ set speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when there is no speaker in the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list to the bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on one of these buttons , to make your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ u ; system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose a voice type , three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and Girl agree to choose from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click here , the new speaker appears on the card index speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use it . go back to the card General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) so that the T@@ TS service is enabled by &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the card &apos;s orders to create and manage text orders . see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can set the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card icon General to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) and you can create text orders and read the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is finished , it runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field voice output is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected and t@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the system pane of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the reading is finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with buttons in this row , you can start , pause , pause , pause and resume text orders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board , or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for an order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the debit card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the index icon General and tick the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text of the displayed web page . then check the text that is to be read before . then select the text that should be read before . after a short time the speech output should begin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML , pre @-@ he@@ aders and other invisible brands will be read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &amp; Po@@ ds ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text that is to be read before . then check the text that is to be read before . then select the text you want to read in the main menu . then the speech output should begin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also works when &amp; Bs ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; k@@ de ; which informs you about events you set , and you can read the text of these messages also from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different kinds of messages . for example , set up a message in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program is supported by a menu entry in the Settings menu of this program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml file is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by email , and also the expression / local / in@@ box since it can be assumed in most cases as assumed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts , filters are not required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is processed before it is sent to the program of speech dispat@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to select wrong spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , or to deal with certain defici@@ encies of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be preferred to all other orders and will keep these orders . if the issue of the screen reader is read , the retained earnings will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses news . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can be read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages . read it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order you send from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which have no special ur@@ gency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all four orders are processed in queu@@ es except for the output of screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a Screen Reader while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such file , this output is stopped and ended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you need to know that filters are never used to issue Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filter edit the text and pass it to the next filter . at present , there are three types of filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can still be more types of filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sub@@ stitu@@ tions replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can either be supplied as words or as regular expressions . it is supplied with pre@@ defined string insertion filters that enable replacing of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the re@@ format of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; transform@@ ers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from a format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have sent a female voice for example on the card card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for a speech output . if the filter detects that its rules are not applied , the text will continue to change the text to the next filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a text assignment , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the below setup di@@ alogs will be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for setting up character set filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged for the associated replacement text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it must differ only from the name of the other filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Cre@@ ating . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to post@@ p@@ one the word or regular expression in the list , click here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with these buttons , you can load or delete a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a language is entered here , the filter will only apply if the speaker for the text order speaks one of the languages registered here . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button at the click of the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the application ID running programs receive you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers you have to om@@ it . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID cou@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 can only be entered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison of words , the string @-@ chain replace filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited on both sides by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this manual you will find no manual for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls package .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former will translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such changes . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the path for the program x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using the speaker selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker that is set up on the card card speaker , or to a speaker with certain features . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before writing a text to the filter , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program introduces to the text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will apply if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be obtained by clicking on the button to get help during the input . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use these buttons to save or load your voice settings , or delete all settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen , if applicable . you must register at least one condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voice output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; see the full documentation for both AP@@ Is on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ u to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; text of text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more commands you can use , for a list of all commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open two &amp; console windows . start it in a window , then t@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of the mentioned synthes@@ izer supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my speech ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; re @-@ shaped filter , but when using the module for festival pages , web pages will not be read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to make S@@ able even work . you &apos;ll have to do this yourself if you do not use this voice for reading websites . also make sure the program x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors during the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or just chew@@ ing dump@@ s . what can I do about it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , make sure that the encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be solved by a string release filter . see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you will find in the associated documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that own one &apos;s own license . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can also download the source code from k@@ de@@ mmel under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ / pub / k@@ de / . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ il@@ i , Zul@@ u and Ibiza . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ T@@ TS works with every voice synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer for the supported languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hard Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not necessarily required . Debian users can install x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you extract the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ not , or downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , check if your speech synthes@@ izer works properly with your voice synthes@@ izer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program ct@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is designed to be so advanced that the program t@@ ms@@ gr is not needed and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user can go back , repeat , pause or cancel the issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you specify an application text to &amp; kt@@ ts , you can request a female English speaker . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , this will be automatically the most appropriate speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on Add or Add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the Box card will be displayed . for example , the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the Festival in P@@ AT@@ H is included , just enter the festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 will apply , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these sliding controls allow you to adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controls and display this gray , the chosen voice does not allow these settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voices like multi@@ sy@@ n voices need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set is quickly synthes@@ ized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click on Application to click ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected , the program window will be displayed at the start of the program window , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected and t@@ m@@ gr does not run , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , together with the application that sets the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the just edited set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with buttons in this row , you can set up or return sub@@ sets in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order is made up of several sets ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a click on OK all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and t@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the icon in the system section . then click this icon to display the program window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card card audio . see also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only text orders are listed and administr@@ ated . editions of screen re@@ actors , warnings and messages are not displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or kt@@ ts ; cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if no output modules are used in the list , you must install at least one module . have you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjust the speech speed here . 50 free . % equal to half and 200@@ 00 ; % approximately the double normal speech speed . to make these settings be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts , click App@@ lic@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll have to figure out which device works with you . in doubt choose Standard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this card card , you can set up special actions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be pre @-@ recorded for all other orders and will resume these orders . after the edition of the Screen Reader has been read , the retained earnings are resum@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ nings have the next highest priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you want to read a long text on a website , you can still welcome someone who just enters the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a Screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both sound and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the editions of Screen Re@@ aders there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; make note messages , start pun@@ ctu@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select this check box to switch to &amp; k@@ de . if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read noti@@ fications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played is played by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use these buttons to add or delete events on the list . when you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignor@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; ctu@@ ts ; to do when an event occurs , you have the following options : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders here : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can enter the properties of the desired subscri@@ ber here . standard select the speaker , which will be shown in the list on the card index speaker as the top entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise the action will be carried out for all other events of the particular application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the Save button to save settings for the messages in a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to select text for voice output , voice speed , volume , gender , voice and pitch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the settings for speed or tone in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ free , the SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! Doc@@ type speak PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN / /
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limit@@ er filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds do not sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . this allows you to jump or pause , even if the synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can see the set limit@@ er filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit detection filter is automatically set up . you can modify its settings or add other set limits , but beginners will be advised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way to learn how to set up the subscri@@ ber sel@@ ector is to select the speaker &apos;s selection , select some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s selection has changed . of course , you need to have more than one speaker installed , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; kt@@ u ; then proceed faster with reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then you can pause or cancel assignments on the card &apos;s card , even if the language synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these reasons , the normal set limit@@ er filter is automatically set up when you start t@@ m@@ gr for the first time . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
set limit recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and insert a tab sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text prior to the filter ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ BD filters are never used on &amp; k@@ de ; messages , warnings , messages , or the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have removed the normal set limit@@ er filter , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the card selection list , you can over@@ ride the voice settings for the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using the standard speaker ( the top on the card card speaker ) . in other words , no speech properties are specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the most appropriate speaker , which has all features of a set @-@ up speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the method to input the desired speech properties , by clicking on one of the sel@@ ector buttons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the properties of the desired subscri@@ ber . if this property does not play a role , do not give anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mark this check box , if the property is to take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also place several markings here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it will always be treated as prime property . you will rarely use this feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use all the features in the speaker sector , which is most likely to delete the following , click the default speaker &apos;s button and then use the speaker which is best suited to the following . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kt@@ u m@@ gr immediately crash@@ es when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get back tracking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is probably the most expensive version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , you may need to upgrade or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audio output over AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work if I play music simultaneously with another application . when I start a text order , it free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . please refer to the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t.@@ org . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; add the new voice to the new voice in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / Utilities / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / Utilities file . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for this to work , the program has to be installed so@@ x and discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; before reading it . ( this is because the HTML is transm@@ uted in SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are very brave change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML res@@ hu@@ ffle filter and set up the speech speed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not create web pages with a female voice . I have set up a female festival spokesman , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER seems not to work . so , the x@@ s@@ l file acc@@ uses S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . likewise , the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have added a self @-@ string repair filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts , no longer set up or return . on the competition orders it is displayed , the order consists only of one set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question marks , ex@@ clamation marks , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) must not filter out . use a filter for by@@ te recognition instead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t.@@ org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . please note : make sure the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts . ( HTTP : / / g@@ asp@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some users are experiencing conflicts when listening to AL@@ SA . if your system also counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and launch a text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ u , the current set will be read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general adjustment of speaking speed , but otherwise it is not necessarily necessary . Debian users can install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; CDs are already included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not have &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( packed archive ) , login as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following modules for synthes@@ izer are created by default . some of them have a running time dependency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Debian distribution guidelines ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 is installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you need to specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Debian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs to be translated from sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD k@@ inn@@ acle echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you use it , check first whether your synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions given by the synthes@@ izer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to install at least one language . you can find help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the Vo@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone number . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions , so search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates voice from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . you can also create di@@ ph@@ s. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o from German texts . more information can be found here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , additional Wra@@ pper code will be added to the Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files will not be installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders will be installed , but in the folder / li@@ b / . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA festival ; it is required either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) , then download the MS German Festival &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , inser@@ ting the error corrections is not required , you just have to re@@ compile the festival ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
auto @-@ location &quot; auto _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 1 &quot; ) ( voice location &quot; auto _ de@@ 2 _ os &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale &quot; I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; )
on some systems you have to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / .
this method uses special code to give the language of festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; get and install at first Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure that both work . then download Festival @-@ Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar into a matching folder and create the dictionary . the exec@@ utable file festival must be in your P@@ AT@@ H .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ene voice synthes@@ izer that currently supports a limited number of voices and languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions , so search Fl@@ ite first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ha@@ di@@ fix is a two @-@ stage synthes@@ izer that works with di@@ ph@@ oning . the t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o program converts the sound . the language quality is good but the support is currently limited to a few languages .
download at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it to the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder .

select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; epo@@ s is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ene voice synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple voice synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
start t@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the map Spo@@ kes@@ person click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and epic T@@ TS language synthes@@ izer . in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter a &amp; Con@@ sole ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ene voice synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; command line can be controlled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending output directly to the audio device . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; which enables management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings across a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; C@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; can be called by selecting K menu @-@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf file is designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; the network setup module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the network control center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ --@@ network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be configured and configured in order to make &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ e.@@ The device at all shows and allows setting of network properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up when installing &amp; configured . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to kernel version : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded , when the Network Settings option is selected at &amp; vs contro@@ l@@ Center ; when starting the module network settings , this will attempt to automatically detect the platform used on the system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the list is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best meets the distribution and Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . in the system management mode , all options can only be viewed , changing is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tabs : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the network interface section is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the rider networking interfaces :
setting up network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface ... set up in dialogue device .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the automatic mode the TCP / IP settings for the system are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the IP address input field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . ping the already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already used . in case of doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . switching on an out@@ dated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or turned off . de@@ activating an activated network device can be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; establishes the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ network , which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if more than one network interface is available on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org then DNS triggers this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the Rei@@ ter name resolution provides a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be reversed by selecting an entry and drop @-@ down or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking on the Add ... from the group host to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server , then click on the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click on the Edit ... It will display dialog editing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of know@@ ingly known hosts describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when using a DNS server . in small , remote networks , DNS server can replace the DNS server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the list of well @-@ known hosts contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the IP address of the known computer , and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the known machine and click on the Add button . if the known machine has multiple alias names , click Add multiple times and enter the other alias name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select an entry of a particular calcul@@ ator from the list , and select Edit ... Edit this dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts is updated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) , it suff@@ ices when &amp; knots ; and Q@@ t is installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , a graphical interface can be used as a package or the installation tool for its distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf . the following commands should do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first section of this chapter important information is given about basic network technology , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , changing configuration files are discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is communicated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IP networks are currently run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread use . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore focused on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point that uses a valid IP address or if available , the IP address cannot be arbitr@@ arily selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially reserved area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some addresses are reserved for special things ; 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route ; the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the web address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this section , the configuration files located by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf are affected and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is a different content than specified in the case of active DSL connections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is re@@ grouped by the scripts in Su@@ SE . another stand as expected can therefore occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; cr@@ on ; is an application , with which you can run other programs running according to a timetable in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX system program cr@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , see a list of already set tasks and associated environment variables . when using &amp; cr@@ on ; as root , this appears to all users of the system as well as for system internal tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a de@@ activated task , program name and parameter are not displayed and the description appears down@@ lighted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the environment variables appearing here specify the otherwise existing environment variables for all specified tasks , except force . a de@@ activated variable will be de@@ activated as a description . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new task , first select the Tas@@ ks folder . then go to Edit New ... Altern@@ atively , you can also click on the Tas@@ ks folder and click New ... Select or C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the program to be inserted . you can either specify a relative or an absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , press ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the minute ( s ) to which the task is to be executed . with &amp; cr@@ on , you can specify the minutes in five steps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you specify both monthly and week@@ day ( e ) , the task will be performed at a suitable date and on a suitable weekly day . if you choose between 1 and 15 and Sunday , the program will be performed on the 1st and 15th of the chosen months regardless of the date of the week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only be active when the c@@ ron@@ tab was saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cut out a task , first select the task to remove . then go to Edit Cut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can click on the task and select C@@ tr@@ l ; X with the right mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to copy a task , first select the task to copy . then proceed to Cop@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the task and select Cop@@ y , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to insert a task , first you have to cut or copy a copy to the cli@@ p@@ board . only then paste is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the tasks -@@ folder and select In@@ sert , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; V . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make changes to a task , select first . then go to the Edit menu item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the task and modify ... select , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; O. It will then work on the dialog task in which you can edit the selected task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete a task , select the task to delete . then go to Del@@ ete menu item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to enable or disable a task , select them and determine the state with the Edit menu item . in@@ active tasks are marked with In@@ active in its description . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can use the right mouse button on the task and select Activ@@ ated . make sure that the program name , parameters and description will be displayed correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to perform a task immediately , select it and then go to Edit Now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new environment variable , first select the variable folder . then go to the menu item , New .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the variable folder and New ... select , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
specify the name of the variables . you can also select one from the list of the most commonly used environment variables ; click the arrow next to the array for the variable name . these are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to send emails from the out@@ going program to another , than the normal address &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the creation of new variables , changes are only made when the c@@ ron@@ tab was saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cut a variable , first select the variable to be removed . then go to Edit Cut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to copy an environment variable , first select the variable variable . then go to Cop@@ y Cop@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the variable and select Cop@@ y , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to insert an environment variable , first insert a cli@@ p@@ board or copy it . only then the option insert is available at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change a variable , first select the variable . then go to edit Modi@@ fy .... Altern@@ atively , you can use the right mouse button on the variable and modify ... then the dialog box appears in which you can edit the variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete an environment variable , first select the variable . then go to Del@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to enable or de@@ activate an environment variable , select it and set the state with the Edit button activated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can use the right mouse button on the variable and select Activ@@ ated . make sure that the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or altered , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables are only then activated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it appears the standard k@@ de ; if you choose to fold out , you will see that there are two additional &amp; cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced per@@ missions .
cr@@ on - for example Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the schedules of the users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX , for example , with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar that furthermore provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast selective packing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a band can be used , it must be done by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; trains the band back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; do not recognize the band on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; detect &amp; k@@ dat , the preview player , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was incorporated . the contents of the tape can now be brow@@ sed by un@@ folding the entry for the tape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before throwing off the tape , the integration must first be resolved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; by changing the symbol for the band , indicates that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it needs to be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tape card must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy tape drives do not normally require format@@ ting of tape , but DA@@ T drives do not require format@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after entering the tape name and capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat , the tape format@@ ting continues . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a file or folder in the local file tree , only this file or folder will be backed up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a backup profile in the tree , only the files specified in the profile will be backed up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select files in the local file tree with a tick , only the files and / or sub@@ folders are saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ click on the local file tree , and select Pre@@ ferences ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the backup has been started , the dialog box opens for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files once and change the settings for backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dialogue shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive , only the selected file or folder will be checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ click in one of the archives , and select the menu item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the test process has been started , the dialog box appears for checking . in this dialog you can review your selection and change the working folder for review . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the review settings , the dialog appears over@@ check . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you can re @-@ establish the restore , the files to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives , and select File Rest@@ ore .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog box will appear for recovery . in this dialog you can review your selection and change the work folder for restoration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the recovery , the dialog will re@@ establish . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the tape files on the basis of the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing inde@@ x@@ files for this tape . you can add the index to two types of tape :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings is created . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current working folder , where the backup is to take place , will automatically update the list of files to be secured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files listed in the file system are stored , such as the folder . folders located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be stored separately under backup files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then will be backed up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functionality of buttons files &amp; quot ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu , and the following settings can be done : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the complete path to the device file for tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) , this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command is loading to the drive . on some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; stop the disk drive . possibly this option does not work for all tape drives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the option is switched on , the release of &amp; k@@ dat is automatically e@@ jected . do not use this option for Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to communicate the block size for your tape drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the volume has been format@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is integrated .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system supports the different protocol files .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system is stored in different protocol files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to provide instant access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log has a number of useful functions . these include : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see in the screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides ; functions are available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open you , and it will not appear with system administrator privileges . the protocol files usually do not have permission to read under Linux . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter out a string of characters selected , so that only log rows will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select another entry at this point . for example , in the Protocol file system protocol , select the column process , and enter the name of a process in the filter bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color as protocol lines of level indication . the colored display of protocol lines can be turned off the setup dialog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to display a certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can activate the option to add to new lines in the main window &apos;s context menu to display all new protocol lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log : allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log : has its own website in ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. click here for more information on the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for controlling the program starts when running the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. , because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the In@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps someone could attempt to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without installing a new installation and re@@ format .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ s@@ it and the following other folders :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; system services do not include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most of the systems have this file , even if you don &apos;t want to run r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kernel searches in various places after the program in@@ it , and starts the first one to find . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the initial area , you should see a line like the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and then you can fix it by re@@ boot the system and execute the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how does it start all the proper scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will notice that in this folder there are no proper files . instead , each entry here is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts a argument such as start and stop . you can actually run these scripts manually from the command line on the command line :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K contains , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the start argument . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server running level that can run ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v , which should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; using a mouse or another pointing device is simple to fail to say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ ways to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also move scripts from Run@@ level to move the position within a level by moving somewhere else . this will not happen only if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : entries are moved when you move them into a new area . to just copy them to a new Run@@ level , you will need to explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or paste it in the target area -- even if the same entry existed previously in the target area of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sor@@ ter number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you will need to edit the sor@@ ter numbers of the entries before attempting again to insert the system service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : at present , there is no way to recover items thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator key to activate the different working areas ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move an entry into another run@@ way , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the sor@@ ter number or the name of an entry manually , press the button to change the Properties dialog . connect the dialog by pressing the key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I experim@@ ented with standard all @-@ round levels , and now the machine is constantly re @-@ launching . what can I do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under running @-@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v are planning an extension of the program for this approach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using another distribution : please check , if all configuration files are available ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) are simply terminated without a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the importance of &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program , you can manage the users and groups of your system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to start reading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you made changes , you must save it . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the Save in the File menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and user group list . for editing , select the desired user or group with a double @-@ click on the entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have limited space constraints ( quota ) for users , a card card will appear on which you can custom@@ ise individual settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card card password management appears , if shadow passwords or for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this card card only appears , if for at least one burned fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable from the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these parameters can be set individually for each file system , and the current file system is selected using the field fil@@ esystem with space limitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card group informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the tool bar to be added . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works an@@ alog@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO System Manager , remove and modify the boot password , add the time to boot from the standard operating system , remove , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
