<seg id="479">& digicam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"" "" "" "sharpening is a traditional sharpening tool. it is very quick and easy, but it creates, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurr mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper look. actually it sharpens no bit; it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric dunnage and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"" "" "" "refocusing is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjusting." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitisation process is combined with only minimal differences to a color point. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras typically require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"" "" "" "in JPEG pictures, a camera is often used internal sharpness. in contrast, images in raw format must always be sharpened during processing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="485">"" "" "" "some scanner uses a field of sharpness during reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="487">"" "" "" "you should deal with caution since the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a bit is much easier than sharpen it. use the tool to soften the image with the menu entry Correcess sofas and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">"" "" "" "the original image and preview help to edit the image, and the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="491">"" "" "" "there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should first be tested." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"" "" "" "the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image, which is added to the original." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="494">"" "" "" "the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempt from sharper and therefore avoid flaws in faces, sky and water surfaces." "" "" ""</seg>
