&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American writers and practiced sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who wanted to fill the murder@@ ous plot of an oil magn@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only strengthened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting , that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had even written a very shy , warm letter about his greatness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as he walks with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never thinks behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says exactly what he thinks of a former colleague , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and tuned in dro@@ ves for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 13 million votes he won with the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who are the Americans , who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters to the people , which I had met during my time in Phoenix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , receives people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , Tr@@ ump View World View did not coinci@@ de with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ umps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr who struggles to live the environment for her life , and to her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she still works with Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es &apos;s commitment , which always helped me to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there were Andrew Tast@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel has helped me a lot in my career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people , and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love for America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Tr@@ ump opened his way to the nom@@ inees for republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the Pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contemp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps , it is unfair to design@@ ate the tr@@ ump @-@ voters as the ra@@ cists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are most white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks like contemp@@ t for those who look different from him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( N.@@ D. D. B. : as much as the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash wording of the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash as it was the big Van Jones has killed exactly what America has done so great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America is welcome everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , whose story , as he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the choice Donald Tr@@ ump , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , religious freedom and the entire term of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America , after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , say it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices cried lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is this not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the land for which his son was pleased , sent him a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is now Tr@@ ump Land , said the message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , together with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of C@@ ate@@ ura ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the music played in both places not only changed the lives of children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; music , which lives with the waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump ; only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town that is very popular with tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some years now , the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) is playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipality , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the gangs &apos; violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project , the youth offered such a rare hope of hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are always smiling and playing with shining eyes and playing trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , obo@@ e , Pau@@ line , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children of C@@ ate@@ ura play more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero - a village practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; music with re@@ processed instruments composed of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an article by the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents were working in tr@@ ash . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact their parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that changed as Fa@@ vio , something he had never seen before : a violin made from garbage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , there is a whole orchestra playing instruments from recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a documentation called &quot; land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every year , the world produces about one billion tonnes of waste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land @-@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music , around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the re@@ publication occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship already had illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it searched the other coast of Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly raised and inclined to welcome a law criminal of this kind to their coasts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Mozambique and Seych@@ elles rapidly mobil@@ ised themselves against the ship . they refused to sign one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing license . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply denied everything , &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region : it was not successful for him to catch fish there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of this initiative to cross criminal practices and protects resources was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries in 2012 founded by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that then expelled the premi@@ er from their waters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they exchange information and stand at each other where illegal fishing is concerned , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to track down . this means that illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the deliberate failure of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fisheries can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , while campaig@@ ning against illegal fishing was prevented by bureaucratic hur@@ dles and also by the s@@ nail stamp , with the information between individual countries , the actions now happen in real time , trace@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange list@@ ings of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move around the open sea , using satellite data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas , such as those who suggest that a ship loads his captured fish on the way to other ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideally , such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly if they have a pen@@ al code . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can refuse to accept such ships in their ports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not profitable any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue , which will lose eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their practices include sailing under false flag , fake license papers , speci@@ fying fantasy names , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you specifically exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ sket@@ chy control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; earlier , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; You may not run my harbor . &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and just this legal lo@@ op@@ hole , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i tries to close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the closed front works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigation of suspi@@ cious ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and it has pursued and found escap@@ ing ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crimes , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Head of Head analysis at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at tracking , an NGO dealing with F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , for example , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cop@@ eland , therefore , helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a model program
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence African nations on the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth opened the Global Fishing Watch platform with Google and the Marine Protection organisation Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by the position of every single trac@@ table vessel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; join together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that makes sense , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only sense criminals , they also deter them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ships that used to confis@@ cate without licence , and have hardly expected consequences , now know that they are being watched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have now witnessed a 33 % increase in fishing sales since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tra@@ w@@ ling nets where they were forbidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we are now copying other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there six countries joined together in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia did its first great triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 found a ship that was under false flag . and not only the ship was on the move and used tow@@ ing nets which are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded into prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time evidence that such a special collaborative mode of working to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is freelance journalist and lives in London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , the New York Times and Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim to rec@@ laim the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inaugur@@ ation of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Venezuela &apos;s government rejected the opposition &apos;s request for a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in their eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the reg@@ ression of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a in the central @-@ north @-@ situated federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the removal of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but in the end the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a grave and wide @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum was considered to be the only way to regain its institutional structures and to close a new governance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a 12 @-@ hour strike on the following day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , was planned to continue on November 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Venezuela : tomorrow &apos;s National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; The Return of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches , which are published in real time , testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Twitter , images that talk about arguments , as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially big waves hit the news of police repression , located in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators moved to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own testimony before the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later , they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because one could see anything else what many national gar@@ di@@ sts did not have ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round about the magnitude of suppression per day : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the dictatorship has suppressed the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a ten@@ dering process - this has now been proven in the eyes of many , by the presence of countless people on the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your removal of office !
on the road !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has done little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis , and rather engaged in keeping critical voices silent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they took us so much , but also the fear ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mar@@ ches increasingly take on increasing frequency and intensity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than working or going shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the interview was translated into English , and is published here with kind permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Cordoba . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba against his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he started wearing the same name as his father until the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 34 years , he kept the secret of family secrets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the situation at that time , I believed that was fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child with 15 years old , you don &apos;t realize that you are manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not see then that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in the La Per@@ la prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his story shows what great power a parent has about his child , and how this child chose a path of salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told my father about him and a few days later , he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re an as@@ sh@@ ole , you are friends with one of the ERP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just beware , that they will not escape you one day and I will have to save you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told me , I would become a secret agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine , because my father had pulled me up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the military base , I had to destroy documents which had heard the prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; the prisoners are tortured &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first and last time , he let me wait at the entrance in the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible - stood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of this was stolen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave me a small pack wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a guard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , he pointed to an open space and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked in , and saw a lying lying on men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looked like a field bed , and metal springs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they seldom tie a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , pouring it with water and hun@@ ted him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sten@@ ch in there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty wind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I recognized the smell immediately , and I realized that the smell of a body is in need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew these people were killed &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing eye @-@ pads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian which was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked men face the face down - all were tied at hands and feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the entrance , people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you gu@@ cking as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were thrown into a pit , and were killed and buried by soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know this , because my father told me at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the survivors , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , was charged by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the Memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the path you came in here is also the way , where the kidn@@ apping came here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this route and then folded for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here their names were changed , and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above was to be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the lie - the euph@@ em@@ ism , for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &apos; war of war &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then at that age , I had no idea what the &quot; spo@@ ils of war &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when I was later at the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et , or perhaps military in@@ signia identical to that one has fought against . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war @-@ yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always wondered how my father , the chief of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie , and I &apos;d never like to enter a house and steal everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who steal your cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explo@@ ded against anger , struck me and cried : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you go so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , we need no other ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so my father was .
I have not a single good memory of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll collar jum@@ per made of wool . both my father made from La Per@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the defence accused me of being a pity on this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay down on what they wanted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , I was there to cancel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last vile act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , when I &apos;m older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have children , you realize the value of a life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one develops and real@@ ises that it is wrong , to kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even went so far to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , so you executed people during the dictatorship . but why did the bodies disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why kid@@ ding children ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always asked myself again : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they could have put them into prison , but they could easily put them into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why did their bodies disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did these people not even have families , to whom one could give their mortal remains ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ inable act , which one can do to a man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they picked up machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something remains , of course , always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to make it clear , I have nothing against the military . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was even at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of showing my father arose during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I made him alle@@ gations of all the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience because of that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t kill anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt internally rejected and asked myself what all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; supposedly defending them , were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I shou@@ ted :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you tell me , what to say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw how you killed people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have committed terrible crimes , and you have forced me as a child to take part in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well then forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , I asked the first indication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , I realized that he was a criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can blame me that I am pre@@ occupied . finally , I have said against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended with crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August , 1975 and December 1978 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 43 cases were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court convic@@ ted life imprisonment and sentenced to nine cases of imprisonment between 2 and 14 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
eleven of the 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court case is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations , who have worked for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trial lasted for more than three years , but the research for it took 39 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ inian government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was able to establish a memorial , which is now being run by human rights organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving license , witnessed a very mis@@ informed translation in the last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fal@@ sely translated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 1 to 20 September , the wrong translation was to be found on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mistake was made by Julian Hol@@ mes , a native of Ky@@ ot@@ os , who made it aware of the local newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , published in Kyoto , wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city such as Kyoto easily unacceptable , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the invalid English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not@@ e@@ worthy motor@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture noted for the translation error . furthermore she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before it was published .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as follows , a blo@@ gger reported about the ap@@ ology : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that older people felt offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News argued about the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan , and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; terrible &quot; has been den@@ ounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of elderly drivers who are nationwide in accidents are quite a concern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of total 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this equ@@ ates to a percentage of 10 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the number of accidents has declined overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previously un@@ named Reporter brought comments to the light in the article published on Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ w against older drivers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article on Yahoo on the translation error has , among other things , received the following comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; Is this ( &quot; fear@@ some mot@@ orists &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how wrong is the translation really not ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .

there are many reasons for the wide spread of translation errors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for translation , one needs two important skills : passive language profi@@ ci@@ ency in order to understand the source text and to translate it into the target language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally speaking , the belief that translators are in the target language - should not be native speakers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate the French into French - not from French into English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Flickr user Karl Baron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language , which could translate translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees , leave translations in the company house . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is the best , is made as a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mechanical translations are also widely used , often with funny results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pro@@ ver@@ bial and mysterious phrases , which arise through mechanical translations , show that this technology can be replaced by no human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious im@@ prints that often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards one can expect more thorough translations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by opposition groups that oppose the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems , that Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet sites are locked again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media has been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without cable TV and informative national television channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing , that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ in@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previous research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds poorly or refuses the request when making such a website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we confirm a DNA lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , 6 April , V@@ PI@@ TV was closed on Thursday , 6 April when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fl@@ ores was beaten , while he was in police custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multimedia reporting on current events in the country more and more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , many girls are slaves to receive training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , as a child , was a cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , T@@ ina struggles for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ adi@@ s that were just as victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the shortened version of a report by Kur@@ haus , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as@@ que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household , where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before her graduation , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she was ten years old she began to work as cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more rich family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to pay a number of days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the framework of a treaty that cannot be raised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this practice called cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society , and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ s - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tried to name things by name , for the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the cri@@ adi@@ c guarantees generally silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , the family who puts her daughter in the belief that she will complete her training , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of itself &quot; can be transferred to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the family who receives the girl and whose exploitation by faith justi@@ fies that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will be experienced many years later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , they never learn of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2016 the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , has a face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent blows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was in the household of the former military member Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who worked as an official at the Ein@@ wohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mar@@ ín lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra hit Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered deadly injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few days later , the media reported the incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they con@@ cre@@ ted that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice responsible for the death of the girl in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came together to protest r@@ allies , demanding that there will be no further Carolina in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; said T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without papers , it is much easier to violate the rights of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a prompt investigation of the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl , who was her cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be pointing out - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ s are exploited not only as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ k , where her father worked , en@@ rol bankruptcy and her father lost his job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their brothers now had to work all , and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , she had to share the time that she still had time to learn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every morning , she rose up at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday , for example , they cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more she was done with learning , the more free time she had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also this time was limited , because she had to make dinner for her employer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the house &apos;s library as food from the refrigerator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some evenings , the house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read editorial articles from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , he tried to convince her to not believe the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he kept them intellig@@ ently , but not with her . &quot; the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they think that I would like to learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , explained them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that has never been talked about is mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to cri@@ adi@@ s when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I particularly felt that I belonged to no group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share vac@@ ancies for cleaning staff and children in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Administr@@ ator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hi ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for learning .
please report to you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third commentary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the author of the ad switched itself once again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friends , I found one . I see if it works with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the business was finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ s , how long ago ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tes , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( an economic system during the Spanish conquest , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors were ens@@ la@@ ved and forced into their &quot; wives &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the social inequality in Paraguay , and the vision of power , are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bill submitted to Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay is changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian members of Parliament recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulating the use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is accepted by Parliament , users must register with a government agency in Egypt to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be established that is assigned to give citizens a permit to grant social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to use social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it fails to do so , this could lead to a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fine of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and is cur@@ ated in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video sharing and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as there is no indication that Egyptian authorities are not able to register their registration in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not in a position to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocked Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . on account of them , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not known until now that such plans exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist , The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things , which have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to impose a permit or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is technically not realistic , but everything is possible in Egypt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the legislative legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether his acceptance and en@@ forcing is successful or not , the draft is in accordance with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , whose senses the control is maxim@@ ized and ensuring that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life imprisonment for those intended to threaten public order and to protest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high up in the Kur@@ dist@@ an Mountains in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal conserv@@ ation@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , between 800 and 1,000 animals , the International Union for Conservation of Nature are located between 800 and 1,000 animals , thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video ensures that they have a recording of a large cat in the c@@ amer@@ af@@ all Raz@@ a breaks out in sheer joy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately likes to show another side of her country which is not only of war and conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years , she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group , and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and film@@ maker , produced this video for En@@ sia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his works have appeared in numerous international publications , including TI@@ ME , Sunday Times Magazine , FT Magazine , Washington Post and The New York Times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meyer filmed films for National Ge@@ ographic , P@@ BS , CN@@ N and HB@@ O . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 2009 to 2014 , Meyer lived in Nor@@ di@@ ra@@ k where he founded the first Iraqi photo agency with met@@ ro@@ graphy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the daily paper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the life of those who had been hit by the &quot; three @-@ fold disaster &quot; of March 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspap@@ er has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the Pre@@ f@@ ecture Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbour@@ hoods of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused whole coastal cities to disappear from the map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was still experiencing a nuclear accident , so 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a local perspective , the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authority , as well as survey results of those concerned themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma - Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspap@@ er reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare @-@ homes ( the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; auto@@ cla@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma trains the final light by 70 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , one still stri@@ ves to reloc@@ ate to final replacement houses six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated of temporary shel@@ ters ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated people left after the disaster in temporary shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led in final homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors until December 2016 , which constitutes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while nearly 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are back in operation , only 30 per cent of the ports of fisheries have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land , have affected extensively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 per cent of arable land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 % destroyed arable land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear black@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of tourists in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate is up to 90 percent on the same level as before mis@@ fortune . however , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma can show only 75 percent here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal residents , it is harder to earn their livel@@ ihood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the ev@@ acu@@ ees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung explains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken steps to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those questioned believe that still not enough was done in cat@@ astroph@@ es prevention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how it is about those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her issue to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also focused her attention on the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also a witness of the worst disaster @-@ induced , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 2017 , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma living outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ acu@@ ees , who still live in temporary shel@@ ters , are older than 50 years old . they are involved in building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people meet people from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be greater than common@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we deal with subjects that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we talk to five Global Vo@@ ices members , who have felt very strongly connected to someone about language and country borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia had struck him against the head . millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors operated on him this Saturday , and now moved him into an artificial coma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a punch . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás declared that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service until the conclusion of the incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures show the police officers how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would see television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another video with the same scenes , filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the clip shown below , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus living in another federal state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while it is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he was forced to crimin@@ alize the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools .
police attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where brutal police intervention against demonstr@@ ators happened last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police officers were in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators built a stage for speakers , rubber floors and tear gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via speaker announcements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once again Brazilian media have shifted traffic protests by directing the focus to another , unexpected protag@@ onist : a window pane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo ad@@ ored a broken glass window , to illustr@@ atively design their titles with a photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a set in fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more on a broken window pane as about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must also be recognised , if one is strictly against any kind of property damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cuba , the most forgotten villages in Cuba &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba made the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ otte , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill , irrespective of the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar crop on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is two years ago , when the activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar cane factories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the installation , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost its plants until only the frame of steel and concrete remained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to invent themselves .
some changed the work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories , which are still grinding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after long in@@ active time are still in operation , because they were preserved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene reminds me that Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sugar cane industry has already with@@ stood the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message would have been a motive for the rest of the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why is the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the church already saw better times .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar@@ cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive for the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production goal was 4 million tonnes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they only allowed the factories to produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , the Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; that was the first words of the Cuban president F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ender . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same thing happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost all respon@@ dents said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to obtain the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the first year of scho@@ oling , the first letters began to come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could approve any withdrawal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from then on , the responsibility was handed over and the letters were getting more and more frequent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , where he helped build the factory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with each part he removed , he dis@@ moun@@ ts one of his 31 years of work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most developed industrial area , from Cuba and the most important work@@ station producer , has been extingu@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives to jobs and services that were generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut speech of October 21 , 2002 when he was guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were not in operation for five years , everything would go well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
price of the Population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two years the community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to dis@@ rupt it , they also ceased to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road ; this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they became spare parts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the prospects of the future , many young people left the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the care of the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forty @-@ one harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month , to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a follow@@ er person , but he gives the lies he told him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have been struggling for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene is aged 65 years in retirement , not because he is not lacking in strength , but because he is bitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Nations @-@ Te@@ ens use hip @-@ hop to express themselves , and get their own culture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recording of a song by &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do this through hip hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , the workshop leaders bring mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original workshops were led by David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked together with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop makes it possible for young participants to explore topics like &quot; cultural identity , speech , discourse , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes into mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which young people are the main actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the strain of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ cal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; where nearly two dozen usually indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation , uses the motif of a video game to medi@@ ate how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is , despite the influences of globalisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not always master the languages of the First Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the youngsters involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop Group , who gave them a stake in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as well as a translation into English translated into German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I try to continue my days on earth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is the day , where you will take our cry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because as youth , we lost our way in life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I believe that we will raise ourselves one day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this way , they can grow and as well as our youth advance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , they can do what it meant by the Creator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the comment section the reader and advocate of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributed a contribution and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ name ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic dishes ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) outside a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Japan , you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , they will be displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of every dish served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers can see these plastic dishes , and then decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a number of these small companies producing those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is now turned into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger La@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now in special sale : new with plastic dishes decorated cell tapes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of these artificial foods were converted to kit@@ sch@@ y colle@@ cti@@ bles , as in this case , refrigerator magn@@ ets : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are a few sho@@ ot@@ ings fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new boom of food supplies is increasingly complex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile phone stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) , we found a good use as a mobile support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this part , too , was made for the Tokyo train station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing approach to the comedy , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some mobile phone stands and mobile designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , ik@@ ura or Lach@@ s@@ rogen is used , a popular T@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with laughing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing shape , for example to surprise colleagues or family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of mel@@ tdown ice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there are also pad@@ dings ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 of the h@@ ash@@ tag #
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi neighborhood , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following video shows , how Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of victims of the conflict in the background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day after a violent incident , no one looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the commun@@ es that have learned to live with the pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind each body , behind every bone @-@ find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learning to live with drug stores &quot; ) and tells stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project so :
organised crime lets us fear not only about our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for instance , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; like fear life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who visits secret graves after his son every weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , to the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I &apos;m alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , she has no income . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get the one ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must show not only the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never look at violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I know illness and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pass a newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day , and I see the pages with pictures that can only come from a text@@ book for criminals or from specialists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot be in@@ different , or consider this as normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she continues to write :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it is not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone , and those who fear that something happened to them too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see our weakness , when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ activity of people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village might be justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they are trying to argue that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they do not stir and remain silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months &quot; black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family re@@ pressed for month &apos;s money from their business until they had destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you think of everything you have lost , and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pain of it never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we only contact , if it is absolutely necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farther we are removed , the better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will dec@@ eive or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked myself in these terrible days whether wines would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez V@@ ega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation that was drawn by violence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes , un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his childhood was over two years earlier than he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born as Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence caused by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Om@@ bud@@ s@@ man for Public Security and Government of the United States Government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 alone , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that out@@ run the organised crime in Mexico , which inv@@ ade the soul of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few stories are still alive in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co 2015 has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a picture is worth a thousand words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by the Flickr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this article and the pages that he links contains contain images on which violence is represented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or , or un@@ mask a fake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how is the year after something appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether it &apos;s true or un@@ true , tends to pass on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to illustrate trage@@ dies that have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this false pairing of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in the DRC and Myanmar and Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it raises questions about our longing for pictures , to messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 a tan@@ ker tra@@ cked the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been neglected and devast@@ ated for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tra@@ gically , the tank truck came to the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses envel@@ oped , including a cinem@@ as nearby , which was full of people watching the football World Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
houses burned and stolen cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were inc@@ iner@@ ated to un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ably .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; Das is Nigeria &quot; . my@@ stic Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gru@@ es@@ ome scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows rows of carbon@@ ated bodies , which are lined up on the floor while individuals are looking at them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but here , the story does not end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years the same photo has been written several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed it to real trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happened and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters from B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eye witnesses drastically reported atro@@ cities , in which they had to flee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses and shops were burned down , dead bodies were in streets and bushes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were reports according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; no one was left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said a human rights watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time was illustrated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict of conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and here , the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a receipt for mass kill@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one step further , personal comments , such as this example , fal@@ sely relate the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media to provide arguments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya , the picture from S@@ ange appeared in Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a lightning detection , published by the United Nations described those who could escape pun@@ ches , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while others reported from violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , the following appeared as the following , which brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page that fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Burma was said to have participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 may be accessed here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other news organizations , called AF@@ P as their source , mistakenly attributed Th@@ ein bein@@ gn@@ ess to this statement , but were not associated with the image from the DR Congo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world &apos;s reach of false information
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traces of these false links reach back to 2011 and 2012 , and are actually coming from all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; reverse search , &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the picture from the DR Congo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they come from a mixed mask private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have passed false reports , and some have tried to expose for@@ geri@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have put examples of impro@@ per use and associated with the respective countries , on the basis of which side they have been published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also have been inter@@ connected ) , several examples may be used for ab@@ u@@ sive use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are some cases , which can now be completely flus@@ hed out ( on the map in orange ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; case studies of false copies of the picture from the DR Congo , Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the orange countries point to pages or servers , which are still available through the examples of counter@@ fei@@ ting or fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the countries in grey are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to indicate counter@@ fei@@ ting examples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein in 2012 admitted that monks and politicians participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the image of che@@ ek . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article was updated in 2014 , and currently the image is contained in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article from 2014 on students who have been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news of An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the picture was put into circulation following the 2015 B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ til@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns the world is asleep ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture of the DR Congo emerged , provided with this T@@ witter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and provoked a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wanted to achieve a greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; United States , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence for the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the target was to focus attention on the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting in comparison with Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a message that supposedly had been written by a &quot; Pater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; over the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums like this presented here on Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Embassy in which the picture was taken from the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos were dis@@ soci@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are other confirmed examples of a faulty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tin@@ Eye also points to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) but are no longer completely trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Japan and possibly China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have picture file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all these cases , which appeared first clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may eventually have a proper description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two strong themes or frames , that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence related to the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand religion and to understand the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are tens of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggests this mood of mis@@ information and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ish the real horror of what is actually happening in the Republic of Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spread of violent pictures has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example , here ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equal to the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even asked by the victims themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent pictures will des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and spectators and take their ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media works to help others ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news &quot; . they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can be used in context or in a completely impro@@ per way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , any investigation of false prescri@@ p@@ tions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons using the CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. unbe@@ atable ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not at all to translate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such words exist in each language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly , every attempt of a simple translation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a word or phrase does not suff@@ ice , why a full explanation and sometimes a bit of context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these unique words have been collected all the time in an online list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the blog , for example , you can find words from the sales language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Pay attention to your parents in recognition of how to have tried in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the comfort or sl@@ oth , which you feel after getting war@@ med in the sun during cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words , from his blog about : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts , and ar@@ ouse our curiosity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favourite songs here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a photographer talking about everyday life in Tokyo

used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lee Chap@@ man is a street photographer , who is very productive to document life in Tokyo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during Chap@@ man , who works as a professional photographer for the Guardian , the Econom@@ ist , Daily Mail and other publications , his blog Tokyo Times is updated three times a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new photos : the silence of an abandoned Japanese village
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , I managed to add the area to Japan to my portfolio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just published a video interview with the street photographer Lee Chap@@ man from Tokyo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alongside Chap@@ mans &apos;s blog and portfolio , his photographs can be seen on his Tokyo Times Inst@@ agra@@ m and Twitter accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like Sri Lanka , with the worst fl@@ utes disaster of the decade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , the island state of Sri Lanka is facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country passed over the shore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a response from the disaster response from Sri Lanka to 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people were missed because of the floods and mud pools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and around 100,000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 secure residence locations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rain@@ falls left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas decreased slowly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health and hygiene of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following images and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood in Ta@@ w@@ ama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods are wor@@ rying the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fever crisis , Save the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ all are already on their way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the N@@ elu@@ wa bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ ago@@ da village near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the air force provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations , and another five are made to transport emergency supplies to the inhabitants included in their flooded villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have travelled to help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fac@@ ebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and food for flood victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we are in the area around Chal@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 , if you need help in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; key that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also launched an &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations caused by floods and land@@ slides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unified efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully util@@ ised , bring people in need of security and help remedi@@ al measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Muslims that one cannot see
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Women &apos;s March , January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approved in January , I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and dear friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I confi@@ de in her four years old daughter , she confi@@ des to me her children ; she is my rock in fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last minute , we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next , we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some keep the i@@ kon@@ ian picture of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , tied out of an American flag , others squ@@ ir@@ t slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , aren &apos;t you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were Muslim .
there are 7 billion Muslims worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see all , the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but somehow , we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit there , be Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be Muslim
I don &apos;t stand alone with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is even to happen to the poet , whose poetry in America is mostly sold : Rum@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which images come to mind , when you think of it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love ?
peace ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Jal@@ al@@ u@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was now , he was a orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the Western idea , the religion of Rum@@ i was er@@ ased , just like the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ istic images of Muslims , which have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear , and the exotic woman you should save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid broke the story behind these images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these images even stand out today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood keep them steady . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed fo@@ ols dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed reality , which in the last three decades had led nine Muslim women to their countries , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body to cover both sides of the same coin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this powerful narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead the movements for change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , who had been brought into slave ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this narrative has filled our collective imagination so deep and er@@ ron@@ eous , that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and barriers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim and American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , when Khan had re@@ invented the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ affected Muslims and Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but am I now a Muslim , and an American ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of taking my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims wear - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I j@@ est , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information , which is our already faulty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was born as a Muslim , but I was born to my imagination only when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : belief , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps my friend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meter concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would see the all @-@ evening ritual with my daughter , when I held her back in my arms and whis@@ per her Arab verses to the protection of the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pray that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging to my grandmother &apos;s mother , she is part of her sisters ; how they win a competition of the art of flower arrangements in Kar@@ achi for decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the image of her that I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings of Su@@ fi @-@ saints ; and one Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslims means to speak to the prayers , which she told me to speak , if I have a bad day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a people who have been colon@@ ised by a &quot; Empire &quot; over centuries , which a company established with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

approved for use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my dar@@ ing grandfather is crying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , while he writes books about the modern Islam and the In@@ dependence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an was forced to wept for his family in India . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last two centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped from a century ago , over a Muslim country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by newspapers of his time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion , one goes back deep into our unforgettable family trees , our un@@ founded history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered over every continent apart from Antar@@ cti@@ ca , went into Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the w@@ reck@@ age of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy is ha@@ unted by the US and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago , Az@@ aan , called Bil@@ al , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means that Mal@@ col@@ m X will call an American hero .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the warmth I feel when people crowded the airports , to fight against the Muslim ban . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams , and when we say black life counts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be an American , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Musli@@ mah , a Muslim and a journalist , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion poses more possibilities than a cube of magic , but is represented in the reducing two @-@ ness &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this branch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim regimes , which began with President Bush and extended to President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in the immigration official , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just the countries , which it bom@@ bed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ F@@ ly List &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs , which we throw off to Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in relation to evolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations that We Ne@@ ed to Lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to expose the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears , and the fla@@ wed and dangerous expres@@ si@@ veness that we are dealing with in our news editorial offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims throughout the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history in many cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I am concerned about this difficult global time , in which we are in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this moment has consequences , which go beyond the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ orists , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was as old as I was now my daughter , but who made me a vital Muslim today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things , which I left in my speech here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb track . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things that may evo@@ ke memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity may lie a story where someone is being made to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than a hundred graduates speak about our problems with the &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these are not terms , with which we usually throw in our schools around us or read in our newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people through creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public imagination were presented , four decades ago scientist of Stan@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of being consciously and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; ; as it is my friend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , when he feeds the broken lands and &quot; to other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

nar@@ ration initiative aims to preserve urban language diversity

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can there be a possibility , here and now , in spite of a language barrier with someone to join ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the list of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices reported about a different initiative by Steven Bird , the unbe@@ atable blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already performed events , the risk that small and not quite small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the makers of the project , the following applies : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities , embrace diversity - secure spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while listening to it is often associated with it , &quot; these events instead &quot; listen to &quot; listening , to appreciate , to make sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this format , story@@ t@@ ellers must first introduce and translate their story in their own language and then interpret them in English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the participants are not professional story@@ t@@ ellers , their dedication and their representation lead to the audience &apos;s audience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions , as the language is no longer a barrier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for their country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ amus@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bit and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his parable , John Ny@@ am@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience who doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide smile , he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities and the organisers are hoping to extend it . anyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling tours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Puerto Rico claims from the US re @-@ fixing of state debt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 3 April 2017 , several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration with the aim of a new review of the public debt of Puerto Rico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was declared by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tizen &apos;s Front for the Ne@@ ural Audi@@ ting of Deb@@ t ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ical Assembly of Puerto Rico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the official homepage of the White House of the United States , the interc@@ essors of the restructuring of the debt have also filed a petition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for the debts are to be held accoun@@ table for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial scrut@@ iny and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding to the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and suppressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt , which is not theirs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves declining with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the island , an integrated sovereign territory of the United States , is suffering from a serious financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an Non @-@ Profit Non @-@ Profit Organization , with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , is a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos , however , requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed from the outside will run without the participation and conviction of citizens , to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration wore the name of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Guard for Light and Truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sy@@ rian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missed for over a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual digital culture conference held in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director at Book S@@ prints , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ qu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Research ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the book , published last year , contains a number of papers dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book aims to discuss how moves are built for free knowledge , and what are the real costs associated with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have side on side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to make some sense from our different experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his name was painted in the directory of the A@@ dra prison , where he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , we have no information about his current status or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and family a voice who wants to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this process , what have we given up from times extreme beliefs ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since March 2012 , the web developer for open source and digital assets is in the custody of Syrian government agencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the military police bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that it was contacted by people on November 12 , 2015 who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels was more for@@ esi@@ ghted than the work he started with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras virtually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the crossing of numerous civi@@ lizations and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spent my entire life with it , dre@@ aming of freedom and taught me to embrace her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned to read , write and speak English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology , he taught me to use both computers and smartphones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he brought me the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ s@@ thetic that she wrote to her husband in 2012 until 2015 when he was in custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated them into English from Arabic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It Happ@@ ens &quot; :
it happens during each visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that each of the dangers does not matter to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guar@@ dians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I forget the prison , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I will ring in every detail of your voice and words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which I carry with passion with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if your eyes say goodbye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to bring back all the moments
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and about your absence , crying and smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I bear witness for myself , that I will return soon ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one year passes , my soul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while at the same time
I am in your cage
and you are still in the cage of monsters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bas@@ alt history is not unique in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the 2011 protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who were arrested or forced into force by the regime , were tortured or even executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in detention since 2011 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we must do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique : due to corruption of convic@@ ted director , after release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption case , where a government member returned to the state machine after half of his sentence in which corruption was committed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it concerns Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other def@@ endants ( approximately 800 000 Euros ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the money came from public funds of Mozambique airports , whose advice to Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with a position of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , who submitted the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post as the firm did not pursue any disciplinary action after his arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , many inhabitants do not approve the action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centr@@ o de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and under@@ lines the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we take note is that the company should also have a disciplinary procedure against the re@@ fut@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company seems to be silent , however , and do not take appropriate legal steps for applying the corresponding functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; res@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which he had eaten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but being in@@ competent , he con@@ s@@ ented to be integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly be paid for his silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ vo@@ cable !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil , says the director does not mor@@ alise any moral : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone has been so massi@@ vely insul@@ ted by the state that has so massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lack moral return and to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served himself by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state to become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was pre @-@ charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , not only to be remembered forever as the first independent president but also as a sharp , conc@@ ise and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he for@@ c@@ efully confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , even the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions to sell his own individual interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , and he was 10 years old and was free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or b@@ umps .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of Eastern India or generally referred to as an ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself calls not automatically hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word , have been cens@@ ored for use of the word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamentally different mean@@ ings that have the same sequence of letters as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , it is written in Bur@@ mes@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( fis@@ he@@ et ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ hair &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ b@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; like this :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a post from one of my friends was er@@ ased today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty manner if they knew how to ease his back pain by making a p@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the phrase La - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to Facebook &apos;s initiative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ unter believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before it spark@@ s all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it filters the word automatically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write to Fac@@ be@@ ook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what it should do instead , is to analyze the post carefully and control it by checking the words adjacent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( switch b@@ lower ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the good thing is that these dre@@ ad@@ ful nation@@ alists , who dissemin@@ ate hate speech , have received quite a good lesson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who is spreading hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game where users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of cens@@ ored word to express their views .
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; when I came to this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to upload , post and sharing content for 24 hours because the post &quot; Facebook Community Standards did not meet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intention or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Khan believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet community for advice : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support and thus forbi@@ d words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which gave them a great turnover , that would be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of sc@@ ott among users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun on Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech in order to see if their posts are removed from the network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of fac@@ ebook posts that don &apos;t contain hate speech , but they were removed anyway : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook has removed the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is to boost violence in communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where cl@@ ashes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to bring out the balancing hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages , critic@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better in terms of context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice , so that the age of 18 is now at 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before this change of marriage , some members held Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere as that , age does not determine maturity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contract partner of UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined every human under 18 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were already married to 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , the State &apos;s statistical office of Central America confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed at creating laws for child@@ birth , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of religious opposition created tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and eventually doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the draft bill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained it - where a simple majority would make him the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , only the president of the country must agree and announce the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook that re@@ posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child marriage was voted with 35 votes in the House of Represent@@ atives , and no one decided against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws for child@@ care were finally changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who is a minister of the Ministry of Education , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk that has concealed the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the chil@@ ds are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and it is worth every price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Abel Jackson was of the opinion , it lasted long enough to finish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally arrived : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al@@ - Thomas , which states : , Excell@@ ent news ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the marriage law has been decided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that openly talked about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the draft of the marriage law was approved today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are 41 MPs in the House of Represent@@ atives , 35 of whom were present at the voting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all members who voted against have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , the children &apos;s marriage is no longer permitted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ like ag@@ ei@@ shiel@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many thanks to all the activists , who have challenged him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , secretary general of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before months Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal action , the law should be adopted , and he seems to release his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris , Al Ra@@ wi , advoc@@ ating the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished to do the debate on the subject differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ r@@ ell suggested :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather than talking about the problem , rather than talking about the problem we invite the state to our bedroom , &quot; simply specifically to talk about the fact that they are being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men that are opposed to them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , whether it comes to legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child marriage is legal or continues to conform to the norm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
h@@ ack@@ ers trol@@ ley the office of the prosec@@ utor in the country @-@ wide protests on the Russian national holiday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; screen print of the message , which was posted on Sunday early on the website of the Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l District . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the eve of national demonstrations against corruption , which coinci@@ ded with Russia &apos;s Day - the Russian National Day , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website was h@@ acked by Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or we bring you into the jail instead of Dim@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers posted the YouTube video &quot; He is not Dim@@ on for you &quot; on the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website with the following comment : &quot; the Office of the prosec@@ utor does not invite the citizens to follow the provo@@ cation and keep away from all non @-@ sanc@@ tioned events ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the site - however , it remained intact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has van@@ ished
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday morning , the Office of the Office announced the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were h@@ acked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can see Wikipedia content again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , in contrast to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for over a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series resist the lock@@ out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although many techni@@ cs experienced Internet users are used to use b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Turkey has published articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been adopted since 2007 , after the internet law ( no . 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the platform remains closed , several M@@ irr@@ ors pages ( pages reflecting the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) are now appearing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform removed all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator machines ) , which is not based on the domain name system and makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of legal prohibition , the content is retri@@ ev@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IP@@ FS reports about its efforts in a blog post :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once we have heard the news ( via the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we decided to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ or@@ g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IP@@ FS has also announced that this step was done independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedia .org and an open source project that anyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ ors pages when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as collabor@@ ators at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can access another URL , which is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essentially , the server further direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is executed by a server , which is not in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation

photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned motifs and washed colours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this motivated him to carry a camera with him , trying to straigh@@ ten the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , he was still a child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring N@@ ept@@ une to the international stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and his home town right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he described on Facebook , how this excellent location in his work helps him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just rested at home when I suddenly called Navar@@ ro ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately I ran away with my camera , and was there in a few minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father had watched him , and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sag@@ ar aims to co @-@ operate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he ought to know it , for he stood before face to face , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tiger can not distur@@ b itself from the opinion of the sheep , while sleeping ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I too was on the way home because of the darkness , when the king of the book suddenly appeared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to shoot at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took until he could take a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many parts of India , it avoids women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that because of their social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as fear of consequences they should neglect the norm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was expelled from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a criminal court and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after having contacted a married relative with name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tradition also does not mention their wives by name , is also common among men . however , they have far fewer justi@@ fications to fear if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel , and house@@ wives , entered a unique club and became the main theme of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ min@@ al campaign , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er and is committed to the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was worked for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as child marriage to HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected , and guides those clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women , and at the same time made them am@@ bass@@ adors of change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion , acted by women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she chose this issue because she wanted to open a conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem , with which women could easily identify . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to speak lou@@ dly the names of their hus@@ bands is a custom , which they all adhere to and never questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband , and wishes him a long life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman who does not consider this , is regarded as being dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tradition is so deeply entr@@ en@@ ched , that we never thought about this round of discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try at home as it runs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini launched her first discussion forum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they gave the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women could never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini told :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise she only secured himself ; another decided to release the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , I will never forget it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands in the name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the next few days , Roh@@ ini received numerous reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas they put the women into his head : his wife could not stop saying his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a husband of a participant was less understanding , and the situation was in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini reported how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that shows the couple : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why do women show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the petrol station , if he did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he laugh@@ ed only , and I stopped wearing it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other women have not completely ceased , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it in some days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , we pack lunch and water and go out into the field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear something , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things about which they had never thought before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things , for example , how our identi@@ ties are linked to our hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with the clothes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since their marriage , some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most people it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ami cur@@ ta , a wide shirt above a pants , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a lot of controversy and discussion about the advantages of own clothes @-@ choice , morality is associated with Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled its own pair of Cur@@ tas ( Ober@@ shirts ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed somewhat , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly into the rolling : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , we have only made small steps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped saying the name of their husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some , including me , are still making it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only one or two continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands , only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the women in the Discussion Club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling around more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this club , each of us , gives us the confidence that something will change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the correspon@@ dents of the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community come from margin@@ alized groups in India , making videos about stories that are not reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these stories are &quot; News of those who experience it themselves , &quot; and provide a hyper@@ local context to report on global human rights and development challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les during their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the Beat@@ les &apos;s official YouTube channel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on June 29 this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend with many fans sharing memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war era .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 , noted for the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to make the Japanese crazy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people here have become quite quickly aware that they had no choice at all , when the Beat@@ les were welcomed with open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many famous Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith , when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; told Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retailer Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good morning ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today the Beat@@ les Memorial Day is in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survi@@ ves everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Beat@@ les Memorial Day is celebrated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is to represent John L@@ enn@@ on , or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places that relate to the band . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , that &apos;s your 5 places you absolutely need to visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and of course , some companies also exploit the fans in the market , such as this Rh@@ amen shop ( Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the victims was be@@ headed , and some of the organs were taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two men were arrested and in consequence , they stood for the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man of gold could contain gold or could bring wealth , the police spokesperson of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia the BBC stated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first time , that successive attacks on men &apos;s men were registered in Mozambique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group , the goal of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this led to the fact that the UN 2016 had a mission in the South African country , to investigate this practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the persecution and murder of member individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in Mor@@ ro@@ bal@@ a district , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are deeply concerned , about the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , friends and all those who knew him and loved him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) plays a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community , and participated in our meeting in the Arab blo@@ gger in 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ sels wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who were themselves inside the Assad administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they reported that her husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stay and the Constitution were unknown until today ( August 1 , 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s oeu@@ vre is the pioneer of open web movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations , who have spent the last five years for his release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , thus the organization of Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; countless of those detained by the regime , or forci@@ bly disappeared , are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 2011 and 2016 , less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody , thus the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fate of many people remains unknown .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a partnership agreement , the following version will be published via Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the international community , the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized because of liver canc@@ er@@ cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years &quot; imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state hazard ) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which demanded democratic reforms in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and told a spokesman , he considered it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , China still receives calls from the international community , Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or permit him to be treated abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure in order to enable Li@@ u abroad a treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Affairs B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell in shock after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the exports to China , as exports were largely blocked since 2010 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
European Union
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and permit him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the top diplom@@ acy of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as she announced in an explanation on June 30 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ dis told him that he would have the possibility of treatment abroad , so as to help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy was asking the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy was calling for a fur@@ ious response from China , with the declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and to make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told the couple that China should offer the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom , such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I urge China to release Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can enter a proper medical treatment .
Germany from Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokesperson Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u will receive all the medical assistance he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese president X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 , at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing to the news agency Reu@@ ters , that China had great concerns , whether the host around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada and Canada
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called for Li@@ u to provide adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not permitted to speak and contact anyone outside , including his lawyers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , freedom of expression , and the freedom to exercise these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
France and France
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an explanation on June 29 , France &apos;s Foreign Office urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there would be no further information whether France would finally receive it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Taiwan and Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of State Affairs in Taiwan called on China on June 27 , to release Li@@ u and to show greater tolerance towards those seeking peaceful means for political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese law@@ gi@@ ver Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called for China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spiritual leader of Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself in an explanation on June 28 around Li@@ u and announced that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u well being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished , led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally felt very moving and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question may seem stupid , since Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be considered a city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this remark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because it compared Singapore to other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports Singapore as a city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is , most people commit a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic , &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ing to create this precious land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not compete with other &apos; normal countries &apos; in Singapore , in view of this , it inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco , or New York , equally cities which are permanently managed by a party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , since they are better suited to their power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , the answers to his American guests in the last week were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to these questions , he disgu@@ ised with non @-@ answers rational . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rachel Z@@ eng claims Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personally , I find it a bit difficult to swallow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be very thank@@ ful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point , if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as An@@ on published his comment on the blog , he points to the critics that one should start reading the entire manuscript of the conference in order to better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he compared Singapore with cities in the U.S. , and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore is not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it is right and aware of what he is defending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ sty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commit a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian suff@@ erer ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if not , what country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of grave importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do the people of Singapore make their military service , but defend only their city but not their country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who must our Prime Minister pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are we the citizens of a country , or the inhabitants of a city ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade tends to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and was always a city : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t tell what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proposition seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defense of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak more about the defence of the city .
the myth of &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et should be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest part of this series is written by Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question asked me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; I live in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by asking personal questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the standard answer is usually followed by the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook internally if they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t bother me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Canadi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack , when they travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it was already , when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - against Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le sheets attached to their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with us , there are no weapons ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada , too , is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have many American friends I admire very much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing would happen to me , for example , if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are , however , some problems with the punch &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all : being &quot; nice , &quot; is basically to be sp@@ end@@ ous - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , soft but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a Canadian double @-@ decker ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be harmless , to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting , and to earn no attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , a major property of Canadi@@ ans is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; nice , &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lack the warm hearted , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau looks on the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pop band in Thailand published a music video , which the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ zes , who took power in 2014 and in spite of her promise to restore the civilian government , continues the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells him what regulations he makes his girlfriend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although not explicitly political , the music video relates indirectly to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , particularly as it beha@@ ves in the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a look at these videos , which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued in the past three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision making over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people viewed by Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , a new unity in the army was established that monitors the online content and individuals accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy , prosec@@ uted and prosec@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thailand is a stri@@ k@@ ingly opposed to &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ esty &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Viol@@ ence ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was declared in Thailand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two days later , it came to a coup of the army . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to follow is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video will even show how people will be thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an intern@@ ment warehouse , another problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists sit in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song members of the band presented the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The tribute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost@@ ly cities , in the eastern part of the East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ war society only slowly re@@ covers East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still very visible in this part of the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ n@@ ava are located in the Pacific basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Uz@@ bekistan , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , most Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such settlements are also called ghost cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here . today there are only a few hundred people living in these ghost cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after nearly a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this area in 1989 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the empty five @-@ storey housing blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ zh@@ ow@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buildings decay and rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a conversation , and it is difficult for him to finish this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens which served all of the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , there is only a paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planned economy of the Soviet Union , have left the district by now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ch@@ ry@@ osh@@ ka , which still accommodate one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they withdraw immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother forbidden us to take photos , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl whis@@ pers to her friend , and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal needs ) , such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable growing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

about ten years ago an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left before Ab@@ bot@@ any to live with her . &quot; my heart is forever in ab@@ ch@@ sia , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial support from her daughter , and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gal@@ ina monthly pension is just nine dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when holidays are , we visit ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time , everyone is busy with their own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner , Nat@@ ascha , together with her husband and the five shared children lived in her house for some time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day , she re@@ members the village life before the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administration of administration in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for each child , Nat@@ asha receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , ste@@ els and chi@@ ckens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but over time , it lost its anxiety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , it has more to do with lo@@ oting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the war , there was little work and everyone lived as it was right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when our conversation turns to the end , a little boy runs over us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they walk , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which provide for in@@ convenience in their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on April 19 , 2017 and appears here with kind permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the path of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is led by a 5@@ 9@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral pink bra@@ id frame and gold coloured ear@@ rings in ted@@ dy bear form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians , who are on transit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel has no charm whatsoever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ rot in a cage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no sign for the hotel , but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come to full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests simultaneously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have slept on cardboard outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ sam the feet exhausted from the long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived a short time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ chin ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family came from Angola to Brazil , hoping to go to Boston . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; he rep@@ lies with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her as African women are very cute women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel very comfortable here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sebasti@@ ao leaves with his sister , who is hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans travel together , and that Afri@@ cans speak at W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been a guest at M@@ om Africa for months , selling SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he rep@@ lies smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests are often sending text messages when they went on to greet them , or to report them about the course of their trip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family welcomed migrants in their small house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a polic@@ eman , and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he began to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains , that he knows what the guests are doing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I crossed the border across the desert , and we suffered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to make money from him without having a plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and a stranger , a single person , offered him their roof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several months later , the family lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the corri@@ dors , travellers consult their teleph@@ ones calm@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that their house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a proud Grand@@ mother , she leaves her album with numerous photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair spots you made a lady , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she laughs sadly , while she briefly presents her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya , fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they are gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 10 July , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , the authorities also used the app for more than fighting terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had installed messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication of the police , the app was able to identify and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , Troj@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and remotely control their home network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this app , with the filtering for min@@ ors , aims to help children develop a healthy lifestyle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an app with these features can , of course , be used in many ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the remote control could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal home network of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while noti@@ fying digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focuses on the experience of users in larger cities in the East and the South , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme measures and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely internet shut@@ downs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Twitter @-@ based media outlet , &quot; Images from All China , &quot; published the cens@@ ored news in China , displayed photos from a check@@ point where police checked the residents at random whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in X@@ inj@@ ian , authorities make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they forced the people to use appliances , which are intended for older people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the rest .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which indicates that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly a response to the statements of the City Council , to minimize the spread of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all government departments , authorities and institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a current Freedom House report , a U.S. human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and awards them to a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realise that you are all alone in one place where everything is important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has gradually resolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable , both inside and outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one , which makes all glory to their name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one that has kno@@ cked down into a list of feelings and expressions , that don &apos;t allow metaph@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when the reality takes you back and look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into creatures of flesh and blood , and everything cries out after death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all doubt dissolve in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even when the Earth is on the axis of the un@@ holy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five teenagers were torn away from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest , such as we@@ eds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to disman@@ tle the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all quarters of the city cov@@ eted , just my own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I had no high demands on a city that was stu@@ ffed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence , crying several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I listened to my voice , through the silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a splendid picture that filled my expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in such a moment you realize that you release the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you could swallow - nothing can give you your voice , after you scre@@ amed them all the way up to the office of security service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , and my father was already there as I now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to talk : &quot; let me also hear how you write &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his eyes filled with hat@@ eful eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really believe what to look into your eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I did then , has nothing to do with courage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps it was my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the shortest possible conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I have no mention of what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary and his father like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like his father with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sten@@ ch of this cursed proposition is , to this day , in the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I scre@@ amed the farm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first office , I leave everything I wear with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conc@@ eive all the details , before I enter the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , they have allocated a larger cell to me this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and may immediately set me up without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the cler@@ k left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old proven communication method : beating the fist against the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell body was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ patient &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , none of the surrounding cells was a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks like me and called the Doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in perfect darkness , no distinctive faces can be seen at me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like my voice ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all rep@@ lies deny its existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps , he was moved to one of the large cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would let him free when I remain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
li@@ ars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to disp@@ el all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ elled on the fruit in the garden of my head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always at this time the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was always convinced that Schwarz was the color of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; recording on 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this revealed the secret : to protect and prevent state security from us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close eye view of their world view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a house , here is no country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he is coming in front of me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the expressions that come from him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got used to it , not to answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts , pun@@ ches and strokes have become an ordinary means of communication for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when and how this happened , it was un@@ important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I had done nothing to make this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to pull me away as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the lovingly &quot; confession . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it starts with a plastic tube , which probably comes from the clo@@ aks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my scre@@ ams were not enough for him yet , so they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator used to work as a waste collector , or whether it belonged to normal work equipment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us , from their point of view , a great invention of a huge cable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still in the row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t favour it , so he took it next to an electrically loaded rod . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electricity f@@ lowed through my whole body , enough to supply my whole area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my semi @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared , and the pain was back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this must have been around midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say , that was my only option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hours passed , which came to me like minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of a exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father has to worry terri@@ bly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and hurry , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , they had always released me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he stro@@ ms to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers , or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which had been listening to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their old @-@ proven views on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his music which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his mind by borders , and he can feel with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if he fails to open it openly , he has a special reluct@@ ance to American foreign policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who are trying to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugee of the second generation , &quot; he himself , even though he was born in Jordan , has never been in Palestine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b stresses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; while in water sol@@ dered N@@ es@@ cafe into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the Jord@@ anian law states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , the gap between warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ ron of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you look at the neighbouring countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the general public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - not to land in jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the MPs and former press spokes@@ men of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said that the concert was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many also claim that the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the old @-@ proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this statement might not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflecting an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan reflected in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned traditional gender standards by removing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have married sex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honorary mur@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ our@@ able mor@@ nings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , the institutional infrastructure is missing to support women who were victims of murder or domestic violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a ban on crime against crime in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence must be imprisoned for in@@ definite time in prison , and for their release it is often necessary for the wife to do nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music is also very popular , and is known to not shy away from themes that have long been considered t@@ abo@@ o in his country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music from politics full of explicit hints on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come out of the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been tri@@ mmed to me , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of the songs , which are political in the core , can be continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this song , one verse frequently repeated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which you can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals still have been cens@@ ored until 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to later note that his comments were torn out of context , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but only a revised version , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and advoc@@ ates that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not ent@@ ail Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ da , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ da , who was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , was able to write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why cannot Jordan be able to do that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic realm , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are put to silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former members of government officials and members of the faculty association with the reason that they had critical concerns on comments in social media that are related to corruption @-@ rooted corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s concert thinks only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ anian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now prevented M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in succession , but the path of progress - it is certain that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , from an Arab world without any intervention from abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; see them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the region will be approached with music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , spreading uni@@ tions and an artificial way of causing demo@@ cra@@ cies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to shake and consequently resist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which was heard as a student Fel@@ low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neb@@ uta , A@@ om@@ ori , is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festivals .
one susp@@ ects that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival which is usually celebrated in August in many areas T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the solid cars , drums and dancing have come over more than a thousand years in order to force the indigenous population of the region to force E@@ mis@@ hi to his knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were able to catch some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( Sum@@ mer@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nonetheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sight of a solid 18 meter high , was incredible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans trade guns against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rarely , outside appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate profession like that of the bar@@ ber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ bery and illegal drugs trafficking are common@@ place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region , however , did not feel safe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , is experiencing rising demand for men &apos;s aesthetic services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trend , appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles by famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to more and more regular citizens to go into the experienced hands of hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers that can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there experts compete against each other to show who of them can see the most ec@@ centric looks , as one can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational institutions such as the August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy school , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to exchange their weapons against hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers and to obtain a training in hair@@ dresser arts that enables them to find work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the school year starting in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of its successes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1995 , we were the only specialist school in the community and the district where we are very proud because we have built up this educational community because of love for the children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the revised version of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declaration of love messages to gu@@ erri@@ ll@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , the contribution will be published in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why do we just write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it not even more important , people who feel ou@@ tri@@ ght to meet affection ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is precisely the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ ic and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os Foundation from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ aci@@ ón ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to this : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : Revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gu@@ erri@@ ll@@ as who have lived in illegal detention for many years , who had been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carrying arms around the clock , must now re@@ integrate into life as civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , committed to life in constant fear and in some cases of profound hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla warfare , must now commen@@ ce its ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans had to join together , and had to help the integration process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and exactly that they did : up to now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter , which is to be handed over personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea for reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more unnecessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tar@@ ried , he continued talking to share his love with people this year , who needed most urgently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 19 March , the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo , moved to the camp to personally transfer the letters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the F@@ ARC have set themselves up , as they had previously done to counter the orders of their leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this time they did not get orders , but letters full of sub@@ missions of people from all over the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from anxiety to happiness and anything that lies in between , &quot; says the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ book &quot; ( a kind of cabin in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter , who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid to go , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone told me something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I reply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hu@@ gged him completely , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps he was tired of the war , I felt sorry for all the years of faithful companions to be this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else of life as a war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the star@@ vation . &quot; I would never have thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now I know there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , I only learned how to handle weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC gathered to a discussion lap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the students were all grown up as already war , and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to hear these people who have never seen hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I &apos;ve often seen as monsters and even hate those who have been turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reality in which the country lives , hurt me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it comforts me that all people , including those who have killed and have done so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many former milit@@ ants responded to the letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca camp , wrote the following letter for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bi@@ ans have been prophes@@ ied that peace would rule after dis@@ ar@@ ming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take up arms and protest for their rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice sacrifices , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ en@@ ova , and its first publication on the website OC Media took place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with terror activists have witnessed the coverage of recent months , over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the threat , which hangs over the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community , is not only caused by night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published which dealt with the delay , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who captured suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her why she moved to Moscow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , she drew from fear of her life in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day , I told me that someone needed my help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the rounds of W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on October 10 , 2015 I was attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you Sch@@ and@@ fle@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I lost consciousness , and at the end I woke up in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , some women had everything to get along and started to scre@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : in which tran@@ smit@@ ters were you placed , in which the men or women ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , I am very grateful to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respect@@ fully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , foreigners , some completely unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all was a lie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they ordered absurd demands : some said I must prove it by walking up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that all was just bad news and Phot@@ oshop .
I have grain size C - what should I have to say on television ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure , too ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some older people once said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My mother suddenly said on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only humili@@ ated your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mother became too much , and she put a rope around her neck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the neighbours came and saved them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after it had happened for the third time , I realized that there was something rotten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with her help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before leaving Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I bought her without registering with me , without identity , without anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not believe in safety only because you leave the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our people know already , in which hotel you are in . you even know your room number . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you , it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine ? !
that was actually my room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : are you still in touch with your family , too ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a tab@@ oos theme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements , still in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we chat with camera , I really try to look at how the person looks out of her past - so to my male form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : last week , I submitted a report in Washington . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to someone who was in ar@@ gun for one and a half months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan , no man was arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely , they will now concentrate on family and relatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood grati@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : are men still gay men in these secret pris@@ ons , too ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend told me , there would be not too many . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to become Kad@@ y@@ rov &apos;s court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be present later as terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were purpos@@ ely sub@@ merged to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : is this just a guess , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone , who was detained in ar@@ gun for one and a half months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , after their beard has grown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , there was nothing new about them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they simply took them away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports so far . we suspect that such actions are possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why otherwise , would you not have allowed these people to shave ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people , who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , took place in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was held , I had never had any problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , it was much safer then now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to introduce us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ lization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but in the end we threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : how is it possible , under the Sh@@ aria law ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were dressed ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , bore the jeans and short loops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Safety of the Sh@@ aria has never cur@@ tail@@ ed me , even a hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ch@@ echn@@ ya language , there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they often say to children , when they make fun of the sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : so they just shut their eyes off you , because they believed you were ill ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never hit me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : how long did this grace period last ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : so long , until Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not speak about us , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , you could feel how the people in the city started to change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who had smil@@ ed before , laugh@@ ed at once with suspicion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deterior@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : what activity do you do now , right now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind psych@@ ologist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ els , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a long time , I had no p@@ enny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I discovered these people myself , when I picked up influ@@ x . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am a Muslim and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to prophes@@ y to you with foam in front of your mouth , that there are no ga@@ ys in them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ani have which , the cab@@ ard@@ ines , who have the Russians , but on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of them - practicing Muslims , going into the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live with men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you know , many think of mer@@ cen@@ ousness to men who love men , and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be exact , different life settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not , whether I have a partner or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m not sad at all , I just know that I am myself now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arabian population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the last few months , there has been a sharp increase in suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 brought the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ community in Iran that is shaped by poverty and unemployment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ avia was married , and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a video made on YouTube kept the moments , after he had lit himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Manifest@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hang@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and follow a safe work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the region where a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ community living in Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis , making it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy in Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the rich@@ est and most valuable areas of land for Iranian agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Iranian regime refuses to systematically refuse jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s to diver@@ t water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these dam@@ s have only led to mi@@ tig@@ ating devast@@ ation caused by drought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi has risen to 81 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who were looking for a job , finished the primary school and 45 % had a university degree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination &quot; resulted in a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ phi@@ i said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment has become worse recently . reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as function@@ aries and institutions do not preferably hire Arab workers , local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their hom@@ etown of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are people who had to change their first name and sur@@ name to disgu@@ ise their affili@@ ation with Ah@@ wa@@ zi , because even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , because speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi had to endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

the following article is a revised version of the opinion auth@@ ored by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who describe themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are wondering why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they even lay out well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments against me , why I should be a feminist and why we should be feminine in general . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same education than men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are still under strict observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women face a glass ceiling in various fields of life , and that discrimination is still across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of this is well @-@ known and known to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am convinced , and I suffer double and thre@@ ef@@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yet : when I come to speak of skin color , on black women women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift their voices and &apos; Kum@@ ba@@ ya to sing my Lord &apos; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or , that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that black girl and girl with a migrant background are more often referred to in school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black spheres and women with a migration background , to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color equal rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to take care of gender as well as the skin color of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ istic sphere , who always and again rejected me and countless other black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alized entity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs by ex@@ propri@@ ating our customs and customs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the overl@@ apping of skin color and gender . for some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and stran@@ gle themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still lies in its name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and use the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism that is called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman who is so persistent that Inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a possibly says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces in which they can be worshipped and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists call immediately separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement by which the black woman is affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift up black women and women from other cultures , as in this paradigm I exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman , I am recognized as part of this paradigm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life has neither ski@@ pped nor ignored nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern by the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution to its community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization of Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers and streams and water@@ ways in Iraq and to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work : &quot; if we don &apos;t have water , how would we survive ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus of her work focuses on the use of co@@ oper@@ ative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of suppressed congregations that can tell their stories in their own way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their tough fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mor@@ row in the country and region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ sk . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # christ@@ mas ) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ spouse , who had been violent against her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of her relationship , some time has passed and the police said that her statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when another woman reported Bal@@ bu@@ ena for abuse , there was nothing to do with A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s meti@@ culous advertisement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few days later , the second woman moved back her ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women make ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of women who admit victims of violence must be victims of prosecution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contents 1 blows and statistics 2 invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that is not interfer@@ ing with Paraguay Law : good approach , fla@@ wed realization pun@@ ches and statistics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to find how many women are really ill @-@ treated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at Centr@@ o de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office attracted 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
86 % of the ads came from women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the peace courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the ads , 40 % of women reported that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she announced at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since genocide is not a criminal offen@@ se in Paraguay , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of murder in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases , in which women were murdered by their current or former partners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violent acts by men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning she did not want that , but then she did . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she inherited psychological violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most vulnerable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought that once , I would be a victim of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are fool@@ ed by violent men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was convinced , that this would never happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without name , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked them rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he had ever lifted the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had enjoyed the so long of Carlos and did not leave him earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse , at least , had a certain complic@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who was not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you ) , &quot; which consists of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Victori@@ as case , everything began with psychological abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria &apos;s advertisements in the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it led a process against its former partner who developed into an imper@@ me@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it mainly went about money , power and the influence of their former partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paragu@@ ays law : good approach to poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Carmen Liz@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees major issues in applying the laws in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # prince ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ on@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft of the law fores@@ ees being able to explain and punish Fem@@ izi@@ d as a criminal offen@@ se , and to punish harder as it is already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the legal text has been modified in some ways to promote the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are generally banned in Paraguay , and to be punished up to five years in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original bill envis@@ aged the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs that the victims of violence need to bear for themselves , if they just want to report ads and want to receive secure accommodation to the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ech@@ eg@@ ri argued that the law is not effective , if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ation is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever keeps silent in the face of these facts , makes himself guilty and helps the perpetrators to get away pun@@ ishable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to report as long as the abuse is no longer than normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate on 10 November 2016 . however , parts of the law had been modified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the opinions on the changes go apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack his victim again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ sk . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # christ@@ mas ) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed because of a decision by the Minister of Information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than a year ago , the Japanese authorities have closed the independent Arabic @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting on corruption in the Sul@@ tan@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he served a one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and placed before court , but returned later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had left his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has been wearing the chief ministers , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sul@@ t@@ ans &quot; rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , including freedom of press , public fre@@ edoms , including press freedom , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists , in@@ timi@@ dated and imprisoned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a tough blow to press freedom in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) since its inc@@ eption in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary on 26 July 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report , government officials were accused of pressur@@ ing judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a judgment in a dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties retain hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 3 August 2016 , Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Board of Directors , was charged by the ISS before the special department and arrested by the security forces on his arrival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS set the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed at in@@ definite time after the Minister of Information made the statement that &quot; the publication and dissem@@ ination of the newspaper on any road , including online , is prohibited from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 26 September 2016 , the trial in Mas@@ kat took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms , and ordered the final closure of the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of public prohibition of publication and slan@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 7@@ 800 US dollars each .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ als ( 2@@ 600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network to spread materials that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ als ( 13 000 US dollars ) was set and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Mah@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central jail in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Appe@@ als Court highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the decision of the court to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Ukrainian government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information received a further instruction in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman , in recent times , the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ s@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Ukrainian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Cuban authorities : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 . in all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists have been able to exercise their ri@@ ghtful human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial cl@@ ini@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture taken with his consent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area , which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two reasons for medical research to be carried out on site : for one , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the global healthcare portfolio that cover the specific medical need on the African continent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious effects in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment to investigate these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secondly , research conducted by African scientists is helping to establish own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is the Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Post@@ do@@ c at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched on the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the health system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment my work focuses on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , I am just starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GV : what do you think is the key current scientific topics in your country , and in general in Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : there is no basic research here , we only employ solutions that have been developed elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of being a maker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our surroundings , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the projects are funded , in different ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not have before ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GV : how large in your opinion is the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate on , and how can we support development ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is need for special academic education , starting at any age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa towards Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines can only make available articles against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the USA to India : like &quot; open source &quot; seed producers , change global food production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding let@@ tu@@ ce since the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dening , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the early 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he couldn &apos;t use them for breeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patents are not only suitable for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , special red or green tone or herbs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants such as cereals or cart@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton always bred let@@ tu@@ ce , but it takes longer since his work becomes more and more difficult due to ever increasing restrictions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like a b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I must add@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we must do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if they stand trial , no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features are already patented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is very careful not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also joined a movement , which is growing in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source Bre@@ eding ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman let@@ tu@@ ce in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse of the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds like that , as if the movement originated from the IT area and not from the sphere of plant breeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open source seeds ) is inspired by the free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , thus permanently usable for plant breeders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can use the seeds that they have bred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others to breed their seeds so as to avoid them - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the retired professor of the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seed and the opportunity to grow new plants is important for food security and environmental protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds therefore play a role in larger contexts , such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not occupied with genetically modified plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , should also know that the way this vegetables is cultivated is threatened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit to others to keep their seed free , as opposed to patent seed and plant traits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant materials that are therefore always available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , worked on a genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all of the cart@@ on features are protected as intellectual property , making it difficult to use for plant breeders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a question of view
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have targeted traits , such as their taste or colour to such , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . currently , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predic@@ tive due to climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ woman C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property relies on other breeders since &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often , these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ton looks different : 20 years of waiting until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed plants which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the battle already . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources had always been a general good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is what drives us , and it will be impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plants form them themselves and as breeders , we have no idea how the plants do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for C@@ aro@@ l dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds a variety , breeds his own values into it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation is needed mass @-@ wise her@@ bi@@ cides , bred in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is in a hurry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) , most smaller seed companies can also survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the independent plant breeders , Frank Mor@@ ton , is looking for salads at his breeding garden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ton believes that breeders through the avoid@@ ance of plant pat@@ rons would be more innovative : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties for a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is almost 20 years before competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( regulations for breeding vary from country to country , which is why the O@@ ss@@ i obligation can not be easily incorporated into one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early November 2016 , the European Commission &apos;s executive committee , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now up to governments of Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for open source seed systems , states that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open source seed systems for the planned next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an association of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - has published a report published by the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a relationship that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon realize it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ukrainian Wikipedia has voted the eleven best photographers in the national part of the international photo competition &quot; Wik@@ i Lo@@ ves Earth , &quot; where nature monuments and nature reserves are in focus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the award ceremony took place on October 7 , 2017 at the Museum of Natural Sciences in Kiev , as part of which the winning photos were presented in an exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May of 3@@ 56 participants , the Ukrainian part of the international competition received over 15,000 photos with more than 1,@@ 8@@ 60 motifs on the theme of natural heritage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about one thousand of these pictures are already used in Wikipedia articles , which are published in different languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all winners received certificates as a reminder and other prizes , such as souvenirs with the competition logo or coup@@ ons for online shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authors of the 11 photos with the highest jury evaluations , as well as cont@@ est@@ ants , who took most of the objects and scored the most points in the overall score , were honoured with the awards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other awards were awarded by other organizations , who joined the competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the members of the nature park Holo@@ si@@ iv@@ sky@@ i , who is located in the metrop@@ olitan region of Kiev , selected the three best photos taken in the park and submitted for competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition there were also some special categories in national competition : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ ity Discovery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; documented by NGOs from the environmental sector , an overview of the topics , in photos on Wikipedia , best wildlife photographs and best Kiev photo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Wiki@@ pedi@@ ans from all over the world took part in the &quot; Wik@@ i Lo@@ ves Earth &quot; photo competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best photos of nature monuments ( such as nature reserves , protected areas , national parks and picturesque landscape ) can be admired in a joint gallery on Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a Com@@ mons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organisers and other contribut@@ ors have used the h@@ ash@@ tag # Wiki@@ Lov@@ es@@ Earth to release photos , and to promote the willingness of joint participation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , they have divided over 13@@ 7@@ ,000 photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about one fifth of the participating countries comes from Central and Eastern Europe , including Bulgaria , whose national competition was reported in an earlier Global Vo@@ ices article . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human rights organisation and blog are recent goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , the Egyptian authorities still lock contents on the internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , the network published a position on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information continues despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of Egyptian rights and the constitution by the authorities who are actually defending the law to overcome the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago and Al Jaz@@ e@@ era &apos;s independent News@@ page and Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and Human Rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer has access to Egypt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the distribution of columns and articles , which he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the blog , which he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , was even the target of an attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blo@@ gger , the provider with whom also Zi@@ adas blog is given a home , is more accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 and recorded a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself to the ban by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blocking the blogs is very old , but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningful for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 ) It has succeeded in providing me with the feeling of a state of siege ; a arrest , a attempted murder , an invitation to the National Security Council , blocking blogs and any other web page for which I worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 ) They proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even though only on a small audience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , after having locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brave go the way to the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egypt authorities closed 13@@ 3 websites from 24 May to 06 August 13@@ 3 . this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , among others Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , AF@@ TE documented the closure of providers by switching inter @-@ networks and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the closure of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such practice suggests the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking , blocking , and filtering of content to which Egyptian users could have access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is further ag@@ grav@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ oring decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis to proceed against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship , and who will attack it next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are argu@@ ing .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspapers throughout Brazil have reported dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 year old in school shot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; thi@@ eves rob@@ bed military weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called for the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become common@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published in Rio for detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all reports on violence in the city are now published there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the newspaper , the motives for their decision were : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sexual crimes etc . ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country , which does not recognize the war at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the editorial article , the newspaper writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it is used ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argued that violence as a &quot; war &quot; is argu@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro den@@ ies false : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north east of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the rate of murder per state , Rio lies in fourth place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which , like C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , has been empha@@ sizing the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the federal state of Rio in 2003 , was also part of this security policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . but after several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly bombar@@ ded by the villa@@ gers and repres@@ sions against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited from one of his articles in 2010 when he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria for &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio is also causing serious consequences for the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a week ago , the police came up with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to revenge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident made head@@ lines : a sales@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X peace organization and the research institute The Syria Institute , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b are currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a , where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 , demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpet@@ rated by the United Nations and other human rights organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2013 , these areas controlled by rebel fighters have been besi@@ eg@@ ed outside of Damascus , which resulted in local people being educated or instructed by tunnels and control points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as a food @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da , and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mushrooms are not part of the traditional food in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed its relief that it is now gaining more and more &quot; awareness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is planned to convey 125 families of knowledge to the planting of mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around € 12,@@ 700 but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative depends on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity in 80 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally made plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began producing the &quot; production of mushrooms from the regions before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they have created a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i all over East Gh@@ out@@ a for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new source of food on the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using lef@@ to@@ vers ( like paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) for the production of new foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will be visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires , which started in the week before in the north of Portugal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cian region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks , which spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande resor@@ ted to a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images alone in 2017 alone , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation , there is no fire in 4 districts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a _ ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some images shared by Twitter users :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; numerous videos spread on the net , showing images that allow better insights into what happened : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy , as far as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al , by the Bund der Far@@ mers of Portugal , declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Sunday , they did this nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June , as roads were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , construction permits in locations with a high risk of fire are surve@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the Wal@@ dre@@ form , which the government had introduced to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was challenged by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government carried out a loos@@ ening of the law , which permitted the construction activity to fall if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door so that everything could be built &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made from light @-@ burning wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , spread to the fires of this species . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as a resident , searched for information or tried to contact relatives , offline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the people with information : they took advantage of their own civil protection data using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real @-@ time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial that the servers followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fall of 1994 , the Taliban &apos;s conquest started by the Taliban . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati joined the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family during dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though his mother didn &apos;t tell it that way , she knew she would no longer see her son anymore - maybe even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , the boy should break up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Haz@@ ara dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been killed by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt safe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred for Haz@@ ara , came ever closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few days after his escape , he found himself in Pakistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a few years , he worked in a coal pit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar , who were heavier than himself to make a living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; remembered A@@ shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and landed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , he came to Italy in 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some time ago A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid in need twice a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers because of relatively high number rates , but it is also true that the conditions governing asylum seekers in the country are disa@@ strous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3,000 special reception centres . these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Italian law asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre , if they officially submit an application for asylum - which can take months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how it came to A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but his un@@ constra@@ ined way of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions , soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k put his entire savings into the foundation of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this went so well , that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2017 , the film won the Venice City Award , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the &quot; Casa Fi@@ ori , &quot; one of his host@@ els in Venice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy , especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years some of Afghanistan operated companies , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his Restaurant Oriental Experience where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ qi &apos;s goals , however , extend far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retailers and aim back to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , also possibilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never forgotten my country , and I cannot live happily if I know my people are suffering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development to a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report : bills from Egypt enable shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for over 900 days in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported on the clearance of the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya camp in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the release of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ed Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill , which fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government agency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; users would have to register to use social networks within six months of submitting the bill on the website of the authority , stating their complete name and identity number . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who failed this step , could be sentenced to up to six months in prison or the expul@@ sion of a criminal payment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament , is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another Member of Parliament submitted a legislative proposal that would introduce harder pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the President or a high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the law of an Egyptian law , the annex@@ ation of the President as well as state institutions is already pun@@ ishable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the law be adopted , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 protest delegates who had been arrested in the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison administration failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree on the apparent exposure of including weapons , illegal gathering , murder and an attempt to murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iz@@ a spoke of the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested for 25 years on 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
interro@@ gated Tunisi@@ an activists to interro@@ gate documents
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated to a si@@ ghted plan of action . according to the plan , dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali could warrant an am@@ nesty by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the document published on April 21 , on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , sheds light on how the Pres@@ idential Plans are to support the bill of law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia denied the attri@@ bution of his sources , stating Articles 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which journalists have the right to protect their sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , he entered the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will China force the users of social media to present their identification ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to new rules of the information office of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in the regulations , registration with full real name will be required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; analysts suspect that the elimination of anonymous comments can be achieved in conversations within social networks , and it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only enforce these regulations in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
do you see us in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ com@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as the &quot; organizer of information distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this designation is part of a law from the year 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government manages a list of online services that organize the publication of information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on these websites , websites like V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ van@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Turkish Court has locking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Turkish court decre@@ ed the locking of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia ad@@ ministers refused to er@@ ase two English @-@ language articles , the information , Turkey support the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication filed , the site was closed because it was a source of information which collabor@@ ates with groups to create a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website . besides China , it is one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Britain can &apos;t stop sho@@ ot@@ ting
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this week , the United States government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers , which would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time , and install Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civil population out@@ wards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until the end of May . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Interior Ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
