<seg id="102">"" "" "" "Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and Seychelles rapidly mobilised themselves against the ship. they refused to sign one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing license." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "suddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply denied everything," recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "" "" "in 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not successful for him to catch fish there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "" "" "ultimately, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to looting the country's fish stocks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative to cross criminal practices and protects resources was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries in 2012 founded by NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">"" "" "" "in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that then expelled the premier from their waters." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to track down. this means that illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"" "" "" "by the deliberate failure of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fisheries can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "" "" "however, while campaigning against illegal fishing was prevented by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail stamp, with the information between individual countries, the actions now happen in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="114">"" "" "" "this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas, such as those who suggest that a ship loads his captured fish on the way to other ships." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "" "" "ideally, such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly if they have a penal code." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">"" "" "" "on the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing can refuse to accept such ships in their ports." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not profitable any more." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="122">"" "" "" "their practices include sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying fantasy names, fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "" you specifically exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-sketchy control system, "says Long." earlier, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say 'You may not run my harbor.'</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "but another country could say 'Come to me'." and just this legal loophole, FISH-i tries to close. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="125">"" "" "" "until now, the closed front works." "" "" "</seg>
