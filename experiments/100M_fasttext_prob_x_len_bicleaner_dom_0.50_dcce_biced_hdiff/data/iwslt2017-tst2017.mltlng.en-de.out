this is James Ris@@ en .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long before ever heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA had heard illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence service in which the CIA had literally handed out designs for a nuclear bomb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this sounds crazy , read it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is an incredible story .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but do you know , who didn &apos;t like the chapter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for almost 10 years , the government has been investigating the risks and urged him to call its alleged sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this turn , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and to spy on journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the First Constitution , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones they are revealing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so when the government arrived at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous journalists did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although they had given years indications that it would be essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of failing to utter and crack down , they could do their digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly placed his telephone directories secretly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit history , and even travel information with the list of its flights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , justice has condemned more than all US governments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ stle @-@ b@@ lower to a journalist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment , because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and indeed , they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today there is communication software , which has not yet been written as Ris@@ en had written its book , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Any@@ where , an open source trans@@ mitting system for whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , which was developed by us today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just like using any usual contact form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the government can no longer provide information in secret , and many of the information they would like would not be available from the beginning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se all of us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have the opportunity to bring mis@@ deeds , and it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the next environment worker , the alarm for contaminated water from Flin@@ t , or a wall @-@ insi@@ der that warns us before the next financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes , but to protect all of our constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to find an explanation . &#93; &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#93; This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the French law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages like the whole system works as it works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion in Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads , through a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous on the next release , and the next revealed documents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , this sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why should this be done ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that concerns all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians , like secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think many people this whole world seems very confusing , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens will work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always imagine , like a mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ oot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these containers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what is happening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it interesting , too , that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably because there were no prominent Americans , who were present in these revelations , this scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no wealthy Americans , who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , by the principle of which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens operate , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we had a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , you need less information in some U.S. states , need less information to found a company than to get a library card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip school children off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has allowed fraud , particularly vulnerable investors to rip off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here with Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really shocked us that all , except for a lawyer , made suggestions about how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody received money . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also important , not to consider this as individual cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer who submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to master this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that may sound very clou@@ dy as if we could do nothing against it , as if nothing could ever have changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as a secure optim@@ ist , I realize that some things have begun to change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , we have seen incidents to more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland , 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU has entered into central registers at national level who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the unpleasant facts , however , is that the United States is behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have submitted a draft bill in both parliamentary committees , but this does not make the progress that we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us with Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who are angry , when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use the laws to end this kind of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally stop the in@@ transparency , which now enables this sort of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the story , how I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a post@@ age sale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a guy in the red Maz@@ da left standing , looking at my clothes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I invited him to a beer , and he told me how he wanted to change the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a small luggage compartment !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling , and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I sm@@ ashed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a stranger sleeping in my living room .
what if he is mad ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , on to@@ e tips to the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of art which he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom , he is a teacher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was my first experience as a host , it completely changed my perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the people who were sold as strangers to me in childhood were actually friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s make a time jump , two years later ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate withdraw@@ s and the rent is increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that at that time , there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe , creativity can create it to transform fear into fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they found it super , and we too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure , our cheese ham om@@ ops tasted completely different because we made it for our guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tou@@ red with them all over the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time , and could pay our rent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
things came rolling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ ch@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to find out , if one could make a business concept from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms whose doors you will be when visiting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we waited for the missi@@ le to fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , they are not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody , who is still with comfort , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because as children , we all learned that strangers are dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a problem , remember the things you can do well . we could design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to give you a sample , what degree of trust we asp@@ ire to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
give your un@@ locked phone to your left seat neighbour .
this silent approach of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone , is your home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it feel to keep the locked cell phone in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , most guests feel that they stay somewhere else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , our company cannot exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like that , who now has Al G@@ ores Phone ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could you please proclaim on Twitter , that he is chann@@ eling for the President &apos;s office ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they can now return the mobile phones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build , and I would like to tell you about some discoveries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if your neighbor &apos;s name would have been imagined only once , if he tells us where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imagine you could have 150 ratings saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He can hold on very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning , we did some things wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was hard for people to leave negative assessments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had left their ratings before we asked them online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how probable it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are with regard to age and residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprisingly , we trust the most people who are most similar to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a natural social bias . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be exciting , if you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by app@@ rais@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a good reputation stands out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; Hi ! &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , for example , &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request will not be accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m making a holiday with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can we create it with design , to establish this degree of openness ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we did not expect , was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dis@@ regard these prejudi@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can recognize three things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; third , a need not covered beforehand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , business is just running very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were guests who were not allowed to celebrate parties , or have devast@@ ated apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the project , I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I stood at the front , when trust broke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts , if I just think about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , only a fraction of 123 million over@@ nights had one problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for men trusted in each other , rightly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when trust works , wonderful things can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay , where he suffered a heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his app@@ rais@@ al :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know it properly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they don &apos;t want to feel lonely , they bring books by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they let you stay longer , without calculating the extra nights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , not every stay is going on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , it is an economic trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is simply called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lease industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the cause will not be fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people lay a part of themselves openly , and that changes everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what would be , however , if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if at any place you visit , a group there would wait for Ans@@ wer to fill a thoroughly and show a neighborhood where you &apos;ve never heard before ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if we were to shape flats from the ground up to each other ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what would this look like ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if cities would accept the thought of sharing a common part ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I imagine cities that enable society and relationships , rather than lon@@ el@@ iness and de@@ valuation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , residents were offered . students looking for a place to stay , were offered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were taught to people whose children were moved out , incub@@ ator programs were started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in Share Economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85@@ 000 people in 19@@ 1 countries will be host to a stranger or self @-@ host . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hospitality was , too , already . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before us , similar websites were available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , why did we just work ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing .
almost overwhelming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to think about it every time , when a red Maz@@ da is passing by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or suppressed , a bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or , just a delay in the security check at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , this is true . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will not blame you for your negative impressions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the media are people who look like me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies show that Americans think , most people don &apos;t know Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably , people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to meet you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a mo@@ m , a coffee lover -- double espresso , with cream extra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern fitness fan@@ atic
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I decided to do that , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , not as hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , and I felt like I was 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not only passed passi@@ vely to the faith of my parents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Quran .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was faith and slow dedication , which deep@@ ened itself with every reading of the Qur &apos;an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , the beauty of the rhythm makes me cry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did you ever feel that anyone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet loves ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s how it feels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later I married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Bre@@ aking News . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into revolt .
why should one do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the television channel and heard that ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only my country was attacked , but in the N@@ u the acts of others turned me into a suspect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the United States to move into a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember how I was silent -- when we were silent -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was the first time to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stayed at this night in our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well lighted areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it was Friday that week -- the day , where Muslims gather to pray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people , who were considered Muslims to be free , and hit him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the people who attacked this land , our land attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not easy , to constantly explain itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays , we can actually hear people say , &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mus@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they speak of my church , like a tumor in the US body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant , or ben@@ ign ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you know , you remove a malign@@ ant tumor as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alternatives are point@@ less , because the question is wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the US &apos;s body but a vital organ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make America safer ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may stop a few parking spaces , but do not stop terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regular visit of a mosque is meant to be more tolerant to people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the first person thinks that the terrorists are the true Muslims , everyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or of faith . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mosque . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a Muslim , as a mo@@ m , as a man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we would fit into their imagination , if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IS has so much to do with Islam , such as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both groups maintain their ideology based on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if one raises a glance at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is their brut@@ ality , which lets them read these things into the scriptures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl came to him , because she had imagined to join the IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would bring them into trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by nothing and something that gave sense to their anger , it was a major objective for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Ima@@ m made the connection with God and its church , again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of bl@@ aming her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what she learned in the mosque , she preferred to join the IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an insight , as far as Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family are concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , to our freedom of thought ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one study shows that when people classi@@ fy messages in which adver@@ sely about Muslims were reported , they were more of a military attack on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of American Muslims &apos; rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you see when the mood sw@@ ings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war , and during two electoral periods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public , to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear harm us all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the assignment of collective debt , it is not only about having to explain itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man whom she knew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she visited him there , and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such an accomplished young man out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he spent eight times on De@@ ah .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism may not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we went to the mosque , or were we safe at home ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we opted for the mosque .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we ro@@ de , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because the half of the meeting were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this moment , I collap@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people were there , because they panic and compassion had brought forth panic and prejudi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of anxiety and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or will you join those who think , we are better than those . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have hit a nerve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I wonder what you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , working a mind@@ set with deep @-@ going , in a class@@ y think factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t fool you . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as usual , I am as usual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one looks at the Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever @-@ ever study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , I am in no way an exception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people like an exception may appear as a rule , the rule is often broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , it is about to become a billion dollar business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for industrial dr@@ ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before air @-@ parcel service penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six meter high tower made of 1,@@ 500 bricks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by connecting together , flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can also build up @-@ to @-@ yourself load@@ able structures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have learned to bear burdens , to deal with turbul@@ ence and to react in general to natural laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we want to show you some of our new projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our goal is to cross the limits of possible , in autonomous flight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our lab at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest level . for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a so @-@ called rear star@@ ters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a flying machine , trying to beat two flies with a flap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike most star@@ ters , it can float and has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a restriction of stern star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea behind it is that the flight device does not matter in which position , the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practi@@ sing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al@@ right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during our research , we often pose fundamental abstract questions to the core of the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts , which join together to hurt you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decades ago , trained pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled flying equipment that had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ dder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , we discovered that flying works only one thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically most remote @-@ controlled flying machine . it was invented recently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ ds , no further actu@@ ators or controlling surfaces , only a prop@@ eller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move in the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail lamp . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the probability of throwing it right , if all watch me is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they see , that it is very symmet@@ rical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , it receives the exceptional capacity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even rot@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are available in models , the rest will learn directly when flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let us take a look at that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday lives , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this machine consists of two separate prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when building them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls , the electronics or a battery - can fly the machine further even if restricted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will now demonstrate this by making one half fli@@ ght@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled , so there is no upper limit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hopefully , these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Broadway , the very safe machine there is to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for types like us , wages are in development and the act of creation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in a spectacular fashion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some 1.3 billion years ago two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far away gal@@ axy , so they turned the mass of three suns into pure energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this short moment , they gle@@ amed bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their energy , however , did not put them in the form of light -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , we speak of black holes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself , and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let us arrange the events in time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some 1.3 billion years ago , there was just a lot of life on Earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is standing at us -- even the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a giant laser detector . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of them kept them crazy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ inter@@ fer@@ ometer of gravity waves Observ@@ atory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved recognition performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is called Advanced Lig@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of September 2015 Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the detector was commissioned , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes passed through the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went through you , and me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the saying goodbye to my father , who is sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , that was the fruits of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , a theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a force of forces in the structure of space and time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and st@@ out into the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for illustration , lec@@ turers in courses on rel@@ ativity theory often lead to a correctly al@@ ber@@ ish dance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting - stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and stri@@ pped at the meeting of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured to less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucleus . that is grot@@ esque . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of his classical lyrics over gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties when constructing these detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are more ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 and 42 years before his success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is quite convenient , because so you can customize a picture or map of things by observing the light coming from several points around you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with sounds , this is different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a great deal to you : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead we listen to certain properties such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume , in order to close the story behind it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now just says Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; foolish Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with them , we can make no easy pictures of objects in space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so when we convert wave patterns in sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been working very long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turning the two bodies very fast , one hears the same circulation with an additional key change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a kind of motion detector , shaped into the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- that &apos;s the sound of -- SH : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; Som@@ ebody who knows what to hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AA : let us consider briefly , what this means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ves one hundred times a second before they colli@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we know about it , because we have heard it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this , the remaining importance of Lig@@ o exists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to study the universe , as it has never been possible before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this path , we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much in space , we can &apos;t see -- virtually or basically -- not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are very useful , and we learned a lot about the universe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exciting physical processes take place in the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will never see through , as these are opa@@ que . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first few minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is obs@@ cured by his own glow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using gravity waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and most importantly , I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen and of which we have no idea . things we can only discover by listening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt of things we didn &apos;t expect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o Project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are enormous , ancient body of prehistoric times . the black holes , so to speak , are the sour cher@@ ries for our archaeological work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lig@@ o allows us a completely different point of view of the events in space , the origin of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ c@@ ises of the cosmos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for what could be more beautiful , than listening to the Big B@@ ang ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some time ago , I tried an experiment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , put me in unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , but yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to be live on television ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , but yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my fear , to keep speeches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my little ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , is called &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her , when I was just jumping . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Yes was the beginning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from then on I swa@@ m to play with them whenever you call me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently , I understood that the &quot; yes &quot; sa@@ wing for playing with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a writer . I think of things , bring you to life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I cir@@ cl@@ ed TV . I produce television .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m doing television , in great style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for taking over 70 hours of program into the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every show offers hundreds of jobs that don &apos;t exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new episode every nine days or four shows , all nine days 20 million dollars Television , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three episodes : 1 , 15 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America , my TV series runs succ@@ essively on Thursday night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV stations are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced so far . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that are burning around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know who else is doing this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one , so I &apos;m a titanium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tell you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , take a business or a household , take me seriously , and it is true when I say : I don &apos;t understand that it does not dream about dreams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all a job , everything work , everything reality , everything blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if I set up troops , when I painted on a canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if you have a high sound , run a marathon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and rational . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is such a change in me , when work is going well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on it forever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people assume , when I declare to them the sums , that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the sums -- when I began to work and work and work , build up , create and collaborate , I discovered this matter , this sum , this energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sums are action and activity , the sums are a drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hum@@ ming is music , the hum@@ ming is light and air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you cannot strive differently to size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the feeling of not being able to do otherwise , no matter what price , no matter what price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is called the sum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or perhaps , it also means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is ego .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps , it is the fear of failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only know that I &apos;m not a failure , and I just know that I love the hum@@ ming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a titanium , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more things I write , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more my expectations are there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the land I created , the marathon which I run , the army , the screen , the big sound , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the sw@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like this sum , I love the hum@@ ming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I need the sum , I am the sum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; revised , over@@ loaded , over@@ stated , burnt out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single work institution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mom@@ my will not be there but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the sons of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the hum@@ ming stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine was silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t love my job anymore , the engine was out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sum did not return .
my tot@@ um was broken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , well @-@ worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , a Titan doesn &apos;t sleep , does not give up with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was an indication Titan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing , and the sum I was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so what do you do , if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you today , stupid author titanium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you know you are doing it , you do what you are doing , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a mo@@ m , a painter , Bill Gates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then , my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say Yes to all and secondly , she called me not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pussy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she doesn &apos;t call anyone &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hate it when I am Titan and my hum@@ ming , and everything changes from my own eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we play and run her sisters , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the bu@@ zz , can &apos;t do anything except fit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all that exists is sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax al@@ cils and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everywhere , peace and simplicity are everywhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mental door goes up , and an energy boost comes in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens it happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming is coming back slowly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the sums , but a sum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and now , I feel like I would know a magical mystery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no mystery . no mystery . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sums , the sums of work , the titanium dioxide , that is only the replacement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with programs and TV @-@ hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sums are no force , and it is not labour @-@ specific . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it depends on the pleasure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real sums are , depending on the love . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is the current that comes from the lust of life .
real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , expectation and pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real sum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a rule , I do this so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic of all guilt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice , if I want to hear the sum again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in games , I don &apos;t like it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; playing is not enough , as they work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the truth hur@@ ts
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I prefer working at home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this admission is painful , for what kind of person is working rather than being home ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , I . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I am to be relaxed , is not one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we rush around in the garden , in front and back , back and forth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make small dance parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel mainly stiff , absent and confused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I always travel to my mobile .
but it is ok .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever stop playing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also do it ! always say yes , if your child wants to play with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe you keep me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have time !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna , or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want something different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 15 minutes , a lad@@ y@@ man or bis@@ cuit replaces me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when my teen@@ ie daughter speaks with me throughout 15 minutes , I am mother of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 15 minutes , more need not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can get up for 15 minutes , even in a bad mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on a piece !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no mobile phone , no washing , no distra@@ ction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; playing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and keep it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m kid@@ ding and I &apos;m victorious . friends meeting , reading books , enjoying the day -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I &apos;ve given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to exceed myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 minutes on the piece , why not treat for full 15 minutes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sums come back in my spare time . the sums seem to return then , if I don &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
working does not work without playing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my sum now .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s snow@@ y to me that I am a titanium . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said yes to less work , and to more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yet , I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire is still burning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more clear my head is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more I play the better I work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land I create , the marathon I run , the trou@@ pes , the screens , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the other , the right sum : the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , dying , bare and new way of life in me is wide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m the author . I think things out , I &apos;ll bring you to life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is a job , which means living his dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the dream of this job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or after a car accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , the patients often have a permanent disability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a physician who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical interventions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they certainly have heard of one of the best known ones , the &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; in this process , an electrode is im@@ planted deep in the brain to influence the neur@@ on circuits in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is to restore the brain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often , I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to imagine that cran@@ ial trau@@ mas , the brain is weak and the cran@@ ial pressure increases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to save lives , you have to reduce the internal pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , one sometimes needs to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to let cells grow from a tissue piece , is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity , and environments to thri@@ ve it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after many attempts , it made Jean @-@ François . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked at it under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps you know from biology lessons that stem cells are im@@ mature cells , which can transform into every cell type of the organism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active , they share very quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells were different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they split slowly and after a few weeks , they even died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fo@@ etus , they ensure the folding of the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but why do they stay for us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that they will participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not so sure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing , however , is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area , and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they then mark in colour , in order to be able to follow them in the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last step , we planted them at the outlet of the same individual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplantation - aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we introduce these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we embrace the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we could work with apes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely disappeared as if they were removed again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second scenario , we included an injury to and reim@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that were reim@@ planted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take the pellets from one tablet .
they made them very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we last the motor skills area in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at some degree , just like with the monkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we were sure that the monkey reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , they see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance , before the injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not so precise , and not so fast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now see when we reim@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after im@@ plantation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can tell you , that was very exciting results for us too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , we have found out a lot more about these cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our dream is still to im@@ pe@@ de them in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain releases the means to heal itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : that &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone enters the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will the authorities permit us to start it soon ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it takes a long time to select the patients , perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you have to prove that it is useful before one can offer this treatment to everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we in the West make a big mistake , to consider them as self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to look at them as imm@@ utable ur@@ gency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy is f@@ ading in us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ ambig@@ uous to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- not the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my ugly friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if they change anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group have lost a false belief , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sible democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are painted , our future ble@@ ak and our great , new technologies are wasted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which is currently under threat to our economies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Deb@@ t Mountain , who casts his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all recognize the mountain of debt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but few recognize his twin brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , but they are too afraid to invest it where it would be productive and to produce all those things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three months , 3.3 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , including industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; $ 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar , which at the same time comp@@ eted in the same countries and our financial institutions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not equ@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result are stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe , which , as in an endless loop , promote the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors who would not invest in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances will cause O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is my hate with capitalism -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his exceedingly wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to further develop our lives , to develop human talents and especially to finance the technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as a form of society , in which the open and the poor as a majority control the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy as a result of these exclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive factor in Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they uph@@ eld the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but rather more important and decisive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a candle lit very bright , it is burnt out quickly too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a statute for rulers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations - became a more democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economics began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place by gradually under@@ mining politics and escap@@ ing it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonder why politicians are no longer the same , as before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not at a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is because you can be in the government nowadays , and yet not in power , because the power from politics is elsewhere and the realms are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mentioned my hate with capitalism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of predat@@ ory animals that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ate the animals she feeds on , so that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the power of the corporations is increasing , the economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos , &quot; the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ assemble the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; maintain control , just as in ancient Athens , apart from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago , and it was not very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theory of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; capitalism is doing it , replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste more hab@@ itable and the social conflicts lower , as I think -- in countries like China will come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ unified field , otherwise we will end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy that will make the film &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question , therefore , is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is being replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines are used to serve people and people their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , we must be optimistic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so what would it take , how could it be to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in the near future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the company : imagine a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next , and the firm -- no matter what you are working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then all income deri@@ ves from capital and from revenue , and the concept of wage labour is completely out@@ dated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no distinction between those who belong to companies , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there are no longer a gap between investment and savings , and ultimately no to@@ wering twin peaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continue to imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem was that at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we have them , in particular against the backdrop of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time a liber@@ ator in which it prefers privileged people , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a matrix - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as the liber@@ t@@ arian Marxi@@ sts in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... Do we not do that , technological development will create such a massive drop in aggregate demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also perfect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : actually , and now we are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t like it , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have clearly stated what you think of the West &apos;s view on China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays -- the sector of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some ways , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what one can observe now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China is now acc@@ using to do what the West did itself in the 19th century , and smells tremend@@ ously to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : I am sure , that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Minister of Finance in Greece at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : I guess that is coming .
BG : yes ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you look back six months later , to the first half of the year ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal perspective and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us say goodbye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the continuous denial that a massive fault line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- that was , by the way , the first proposal to reveal this denial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continued to choose the denial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you know , what &apos;s coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you try to survive an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it will perhaps delay a while , but when the change comes , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : what changes are you going to see ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , if we do not change its structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : did you make any mistakes in your time , as a finance minister ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : every day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG , for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister , who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a tense situation , he says he has no mistake , then it is a dangerous person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for renew@@ ing the debt program at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders , to find a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that passed through the euro@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody from the tro@@ ika of the len@@ ders , who imposed this policy , stood : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive press of talks , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we allow ourselves to enter the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 by what it seems to me , it will also be bear@@ able for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG , we hope that you are wrong at this point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yan@@ is , thanks for being at TE@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios .
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an idi@@ ot hair@@ style and describes on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vi@@ es , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and content to produce the Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose any .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to find shows that are very , very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are located on the right side of this curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review will receive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your show is rated at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive to where , after you have looked at a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ line &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has more thoughts about the medium size , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing something like that , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can look for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if Amazon makes things out for nothing , do you feel right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they do not know that they will be observed when watching these shows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are being watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ pping or watching again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they collect millions of data , in order to decide which show they should produce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact they collect the data , process it and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com via four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , manager of program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always searching for a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of staging a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data via Net@@ fli@@ x , so the reviews they show the shows their course , which shows they like etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the spectators : which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they had all the parts together they went into a risk and decided not to make a sit@@ com via four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on that curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because logic says , that this should work in everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have 200 years of statistics , as back @-@ up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what can be expected is good television , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data analysis does not work so , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software . if you come into contact , you are in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone is in prison here in the US and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether there is a discharge or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it &apos;s decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medium @-@ sized television , 22 minutes , which can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , there is evidence of this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not always the best results are generated , which is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , Google announced that due to data analysis , they can predict influ@@ enza , the worst way of predic@@ ting -- through data analysis of Google searches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully , and was a great news agency . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until it suddenly stopped working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it just didn &apos;t work , it was a sensation again , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all these errors , data rapidly stream into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we should make sure that data is helpful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ inable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years , I recognized a few patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , dis@@ assemble this problem into its parts so you can analyze the individual parts ; as a branch you put the items together again to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not suitable to assemble the parts again , and then come to a conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when there is something in which the brain is good , it &apos;s pieces and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use data to better understand their audience , what they would otherwise not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like House of Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Amazon did this in the wrong way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they comp@@ eted for TV ideas than they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired outcome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to steer our decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order not to forget it , this device is quite useful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , I will f@@ use it with a technique demo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a little bit more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the huge amount of data , it still pays to make decisions to be an expert in what you do and take risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
