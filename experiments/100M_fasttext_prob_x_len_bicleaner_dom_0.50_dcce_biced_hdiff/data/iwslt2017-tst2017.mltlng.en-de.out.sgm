<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "you may know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "long before ever heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA had heard illegal telephones of Americans." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence service in which the CIA had literally handed out designs for a nuclear bomb." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "if this sounds crazy, read it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "but do you know, who didn't like the chapter?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "for almost 10 years, the government has been investigating the risks and urged him to call its alleged sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "in this turn, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government to condemn whistleblower and to spy on journalists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "according to the First Constitution, the media have the right to publish secret information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones they are revealing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "so when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many courageous journalists did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, although they had given years indications that it would be essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "the reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, the reporters and sources can hide less and less." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "instead of failing to utter and crack down, they could do their digital footprints for him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "and so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly placed his telephone directories secretly," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "just like its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit history, and even travel information with the list of its flights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "in the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "unfortunately, this is only one of many cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "President Obama promised to protect whistleblower. but instead, justice has condemned more than all US governments." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistle-blower to a journalist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "but just as the government's technology allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "and indeed, they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "today there is communication software, which has not yet been written as Risen had written its book, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or phone calls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "such a technology is SecureAnywhere, an open source transmitting system for whistle-blowers which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, which was developed by us today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "there you can upload documents or send information, just like using any usual contact form." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "so the government can no longer provide information in secret, and many of the information they would like would not be available from the beginning." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that jeopardise all of us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important for us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have the opportunity to bring misdeeds, and it is equally important that we protect the next whistle-blowers." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="42">[what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness hidden in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to find an explanation.]] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]] This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the French law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages like the whole system works as it works." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "also, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad has mailbox companies in tax havens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "it is claimed that a track of $2 billion in Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads, through a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous on the next release, and the next revealed documents." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "now, this sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "it seems weep away from you, me, ordinary people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "why should this be done?" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "in the whole world, media and leading politicians, like secret tax havens, are used by some few to hide and disguise their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "I think many people this whole world seems very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens will work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "I always imagine, like a matryoshoot." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these containers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what is happening." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "I find it interesting, too, that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">"" "" "" "presumably because there were no prominent Americans, who were present in these revelations, this scandal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it is not that there are no wealthy Americans, who hide their fortunes in tax havens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">"" "" "" "however, by the principle of which these tax havens operate, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="66">"" "" "" "if we had a data leck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections in the US." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="67">"" "" "" "in fact, you need less information in some U.S. states, need less information to found a company than to get a library card." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip school children off.</seg>

<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>

<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"" "" "" "so, we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "" "" "our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "it really shocked us that all, except for a lawyer, made suggestions about how he could transfer his money." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="76">"" "" "" "none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody received money. but it shows the problem with this system." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "it is also important, not to consider this as individual cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer who submitted suggestions to our covert investigators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's not about a single top politician involved in a scandal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "it's about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "and to master this, we need to change the rules of the game." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "that may sound very cloudy as if we could do nothing against it, as if nothing could ever have changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="84">"" "" "" "but as a secure optimist, I realize that some things have begun to change." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years, we have seen incidents to more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="86">"" "" "" "the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland, 2013." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "since then, the EU has entered into central registers at national level who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "one of the unpleasant facts, however, is that the United States is behind." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "representatives of both parties have submitted a draft bill in both parliamentary committees, but this does not make the progress that we would like to see." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "we would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">"" "" "" "for us with Global Witness, this is a moment for change." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "we need ordinary people who are angry, when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need leaders in the economy who get up and say:" "" "" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>

<seg id="803">A physician who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"" "" "" "they certainly have heard of one of the best known ones, the" deep-brain stimulation. "in this process, an electrode is implanted deep in the brain to influence the neuron circuits in such a way that the neurological function is improved." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">"" "" "" "with some help, the brain can help itself." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">"" "" "" "at that time, I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="817">"" "" "" "instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"" "" "" "to let cells grow from a tissue piece, is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"" "" "" "it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="830">"" "" "" "the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">"" "" "" "we made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active, they share very quickly." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">"" "" "" "they split slowly and after a few weeks, they even died." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="836">"" "" "" "so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"" "" "" "in the foetus, they ensure the folding of the brain." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>

<seg id="848">"" "" "" "one thing, however, is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"" "" "" "we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area, and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="853">"" "" "" "and they then mark in colour, in order to be able to follow them in the brain." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation - autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we introduce these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we embrace the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"" "" "" "thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we could work with apes." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="859">"" "" "" "in the second scenario, we included an injury to and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew up to mature neurons." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="863">"" "" "" "of course, we could not stop here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take the pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"" "" "" "when they reached a stable skill level, we last the motor skills area in the motor cortex." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="869">"" "" "" "then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="870">"" "" "" "just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="871">"" "" "" "the patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover at some degree, just like with the monkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="872">"" "" "" "when we were sure that the monkey reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="873">"" "" "" "on the left side, they see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="874">"" "" "" "it can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance, before the injury." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="876">"" "" "" "now see when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after implantation." "" "" ""</seg>
