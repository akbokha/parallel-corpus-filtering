&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps , which change your view of the city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people are to meet today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cryp@@ t chapel , where now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is dug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is annoying , if maps are not up to date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that knows everyone who had to get excited , because the car Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very informative . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury , since the 19th century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital Bayern at@@ las is a pat@@ ch@@ work , which one does not recognize as such . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the big picture postcard , more detailed maps for cities and municipalities were incorporated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Bavarian Palace Department , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first surve@@ ying of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the spring of 1800 , the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course , for military purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , when the French troops finally pulled off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of 9 February 18@@ 01 , the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card were en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus Bay@@ erische surve@@ ying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the composition sheet for Munich comes from the year 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comparison early / Today , the example of the state capital is most impressive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city has expanded in all directions , and has grown together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , so in 18@@ 77 when the Munich subur@@ b was founded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling lies in the middle of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the national road that was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ur@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller @-@ part card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written number@@ ing pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original photograph &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small plots have no more farmers there , but farmers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the October Revolution in 18@@ 10 , was actually a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the current district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; on the guest dough , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld road you once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich circle Ir@@ ene Institute was created on the Au@@ er Lü@@ ft@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden was head of the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , finished the anchor of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , he prohibited the personnel to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 280 patients was first place , later extended to 500 places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the cra@@ y@@ wheel in hair 1905 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Hospital Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
young people meet in the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the Children &apos;s House &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built - in architectural resem@@ b@@ lance to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ ell , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as the main square in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Second World War , too , brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lied bombs broke many holes in the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 will be the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn track . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
citizen card published travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association for the Promotion of Color has issued a warning for coloured people , who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls for Af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special attention when travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recently adopted law by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who target dispro@@ portion@@ ately to minorities , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first such warning , issued by the Organization for a State in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the group quoted incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ ander died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more gasoline with the state and taken in custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Office of the At@@ tor@@ ney Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is shown that black mot@@ orists are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to bring Cau@@ tion money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i posted 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FBI that classi@@ fies the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the country &apos;s 16th rank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , making it more difficult to acc@@ use a company because of residential or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states committed immigration laws allowing local prosecution authorities to arrest people because of immigration violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ pra@@ n project is a success project , and will continue next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac formed a picture on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ local association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met at the right @-@ grab@@ bing court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplying 40 dairy cows and as many young k@@ itt@@ ens and housed in five apartments holiday palaces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for him , the &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ asse , only regional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since he is the President of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he called the electric fence project as &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on such steep areas , I cannot achieve profitable economies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grass@@ land area is a lot of work , much needs to be worked on with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental farm and operated it without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if it does not conduct biogas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope , that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the promotion , farmers are often in criticism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disclosure surface amounts to 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of the total cost of 71 500 Euro was promoted by the leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the farmer remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of turn@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage is the durability of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmers and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the best food is produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state @-@ care guid@@ eline ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art support of pasture @-@ gates .
the aim is the openness of the Black Forest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , the presence of a conveyor section called L@@ PR is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the fenced area must not be ski@@ pper@@ y ( incl@@ ination over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the Fis@@ her@@ bach Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ aun@@ ching project 2018 , the motion of eight participants with 24 pitches is currently running , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disclosure surface corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore , the deliberate over@@ throwing Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ m place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals to limit legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a hor@@ de of bo@@ at@@ owners and Liberty icons would have stolen it , if he had done it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he attacked their importance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to , which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the contemporary response to the beg@@ ging words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your afflicted people , who desire to breathe freely , &quot; the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ ump USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this conflict , because of the significance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict around the significance of America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lazarus and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base , knew very well that they took a high political action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ ism , showing the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a used classical depic@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and she gives herself a completely different name , Mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relation of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American na@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to change this from the right wing for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Great Writ@@ er R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atism to bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the torch is not to shine the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh has stum@@ bled upon something here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meaning of the statue is completely , at all , a question of standing of perception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen from the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horrible trips on the decks of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome , which they must hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their torch is not to shine the way , but the hatred which is their only source of power to ign@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black cle@@ ars Scottish Members of the Great Britain team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Cup will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 , starting on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland &quot; something special developed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics has to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and also with the guy , on the street corner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever the combination of circumstances is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who are competing against Sir William Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her Captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in , were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver med@@ alists , competing in their fifth world champi@@ onships among the 400 m hur@@ dles , says it is &quot; incredible &quot; is that 16 sh@@ all@@ ots are in the British team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the middle @-@ distance Mu@@ ir leads along this path , and last year set up five British and two European records . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man who was supposed to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ yle is remembering her first world champi@@ onships , when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man@@ hood captains say they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be included in med@@ als and fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being special about team captains is that they were chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are here as well established athletes , athletes who want to climb Po@@ stages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is my speech as a Captain ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy , as we have a home world championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is really important to put on this home support , and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking Cri@@ tics on Facebook : do not apply to a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of elec@@ tors
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything from Dom@@ estic Policy to his political principles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he cl@@ ung to the criticism , sure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b we are led like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that brings me to Mary@@ land , Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who must work to be more like Washington . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people , and deleted their opinion on their official Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union , therefore , accused him of this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ l , and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is especially important , if it is a guy like Ho@@ gan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has the second highest approval of the fifty govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state , and strict adher@@ ence to principles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as primary means to link up with his elec@@ tors , and to bust his hair @-@ free head to chemotherapy on his side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , blocking of people entering the site of the Gover@@ nor is a public forum which is designated as official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Ambassador Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people , who swing the whi@@ p online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priest quoted the Bible in his post , and appealed to Ho@@ gan Catholic faith . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not sp@@ illed , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the comments section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take up the same issue , then they will be dis@@ regarded as a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s employees designated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to post a message by blocking one critic , or deleted a negative comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much cleaner than in previous times , if one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical key@@ presses and to arrest or arrest demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is exactly what happens digitally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gan is not the first public official , who has been critic@@ ised for cri@@ p@@ pling Facebook and other social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users , who were blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones on this issue was last week in Virginia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County has injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this shouldn &apos;t be so difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable port had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters took place on his leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain , were overwhelmed by the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he did not put them into silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and true guidance means to accept that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last next year in the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round , was connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jer@@ ry did a great job , when he set this place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that really feels special , &quot; said the player home based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I gained it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European senior tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on home floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really enjoyed playing it again , and I played a solid golf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about the way it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ Ã © . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OR@@ R and former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six Scot@@ s@@ man on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a passenger and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pneum@@ ogen@@ ic cancers due to passive smoking
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) are in a study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths can be traced back to passive smoking , &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time , there were 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking annually in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

house connections are proving to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße is in full swing and &quot; lie halfway through time , &quot; says the director Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected as there is much se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not noticed in the plans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traffic , which continues to hin@@ der the construction work , represents a major problem for the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ignor@@ ing the drivers from red lights and shut@@ ters is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road is closed , and only the regular buses are entitled to drive through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z of the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were already quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ ep@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after half an hour , the stolen bulb is extracted and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - it does not have furniture - where they also carry out their daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course it can be dangerous to work late : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many are hard to drink , and there are the soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote against the occupying troops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an existing movement intended for independence from Dutch rule turned swiftly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea wrote the eastern part of the island . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is br@@ ittle . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transportation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fence and from corrugated iron roofs , which were converted by rust into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Phoenix Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port invested $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Papua @-@ wood resources have valued 78 billion US dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 500@@ ,000 Papua were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s were , according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission , to commit genocide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are contained , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims , since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screws have reinforced , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing because Muslim mig@@ r@@ ors come from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants have begun selling chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 year old Pan@@ i@@ ai local , who moved to the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Papua @-@ M@@ om mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; from Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , Indonesian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , promised ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua during his campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children played outside and sang Christmas songs from a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers erup@@ ted on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frigh@@ tened children told them , that they should switch on their head@@ lights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the soldiers took an assault on their tone and later returned to four soldiers , thus the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and struck the group with their ri@@ fle @-@ pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child , who was 16 years old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 1,000 young Papua @-@ men , women and children assembled on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they carried out cerem@@ onial hunting bows and conducted the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously , and im@@ itating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones on police and military posts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the mood was heated the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; when the masses resist@@ ed more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; said it in an official TI@@ ME document that was not released by local media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , looked at the threatening danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kay@@ aks still don &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to be sure that he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who bears only one name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Che@@ es@@ inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said reports that his officers would only &quot; secure &quot; their station because they are being attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; said the spokesman for the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news about the kill@@ ings came first on the following day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; to Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three weeks in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2016 , Minister of Security Wi@@ ran@@ to stated that he set up a court @-@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some were in the 90 &apos;s , and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must be passed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 , and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is legally regulated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , who charged the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody declaration of independence in 1999 , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to such claims with fierce dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times during the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that years later , he still lives in fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his brother , Y@@ ac@@ andra reiter@@ ated his view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear to discuss the incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says he was beaten by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings did not cease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot on villa@@ gers in the neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man , the 24 year old Ra@@ vi@@ anus , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
excited village residents prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that the villa@@ gers cast stones on officers , who responded by firing warning shots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting at the crowd , killing one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured here were quickly delivered to the TI@@ ME . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon to draw the officers involved , and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a troub@@ le@@ maker for the Indonesian government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green High@@ lands of Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many joined the &quot; Free Zone Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a , fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agriculture is the task of women , each of which can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived at Nab@@ il airport since the opening of new flight routes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a rule , the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better trained and weal@@ thier migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Papua , they seldom have capital or the necessary skills to make their own enterprises competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , international media coverage restrictions remain tense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ da and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua related institutions due to lack of coordination and related institutions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua and Western pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March , six paci@@ fied states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sli@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same countries have historically supported O@@ PM .
the spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r dismissed the alle@@ gations of the Group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there is free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura visited their silence and urged him . &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session but remain anonymous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Indonesia had another presidential election in 2019 , but the majority of them say they won &apos;t vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai sh@@ uts , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai cas@@ u@@ alties resulted in a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they don &apos;t let those responsible forget their crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ up with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire recording the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , a fire took place in one of the highest residential buildings in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 metre high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the second fire , which swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which one accidentally calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and at the cry of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units were extingu@@ ished at 4 : 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) , and refriger@@ ated the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I work on providing accommodation for those affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials , which are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 found that the largest part of the damage caused by the facing , the exterior cl@@ adding to the decoration or insulation , came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Great Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , with about 80 people died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) fell through the General Assembly , with his big Davis Cup coup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the Davis Cup single was only supported by two @-@ thirds majority for this sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the often very long , but also therefore very estimated five @-@ set classic remain the traditional competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ er@@ ty was therefore narrow@@ ly missed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; Hag@@ er@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , we will continue to work to improve the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not until the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal had already come before the proposal to finish the fin@@ als at a neutral place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the hosts in the next round in the following year , in the following year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in training workplaces , etc . , and players will need less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings forbidden articles into the aircraft , finding a survey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey among passengers showed that more than 20 per cent deliberately or un@@ intentionally prohibited items were smu@@ g@@ gled to the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent of the aircraft , while they accidentally carried out prohibited knives or other items with blades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less than 1 percent said they were late discovered that they were mistakenly left with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey conducted at more than 1,000 people - operated by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by those surve@@ yed who agreed that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of millenni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent of the members of the Generation X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common items , which were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 3 per cent contributed to know@@ ingly worn items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought banned drugs into the aircraft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it was inter@@ viewed travelers throughout the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently brought smu@@ g@@ gled goods by airport security , and how many had done inten@@ tional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no surprise that people who wear smu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - by security , those who fly most frequently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the company indicated that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people often are unsure which fluids they are allowed to take , or how much of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , it is no surprise that the greatest amount of liquids confis@@ cated by T@@ SA are prohibited liquids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a while , people thought T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 , &quot; Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , he has under@@ lined that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the ever tri@@ ump@@ hal@@ ted figures on sales increases and even more titan@@ ic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ y another less da@@ zzling figure : the number of cancell@@ ations on the new mass market model 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has frequently visited more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery has just begun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ k dreamed : of a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that this is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays € 1000 ( in the US $ 1,000 and in the UK 1,000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reservation confirmation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations prior to , met Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2018 - all models should be assembled - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are 1,@@ 800 reservations per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you order a Model 3 today , you must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new , never @-@ tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if it comes to bigger delays , the non@@ binding obligation of reservations might become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to dela@@ ying the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the environmental protection authority , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules to reduce emissions of flu@@ g @-@ induced air pollutants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes , when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the public environmental authorities than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not notice the complaint , which had been raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a deadline that went off for states on October 1 , to meet the O@@ zone standards for 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced that he would not hesitate to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing in local decisions or to interfere with economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was by President Donald Tr@@ ump County public prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regulations requiring chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ff regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , a Federal Employment Court in Washington decided that EPA administrator had exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration that took oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt pointed out that his turn@@ around in o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the EPA &apos;s readiness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under earlier administr@@ ations the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for performing , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by legal proceedings , and we take deadlines very seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives us , seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ eck will eventually make use of its &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive set of o@@ zone rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bill approved last month , should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Senate , the measure was not yet set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the United States Coalition , accused the EPA in this week , said that the Group intends to maintain legal pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA according to our law@@ suits - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new York included California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ lin@@ ois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soil o@@ zone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resulting smo@@ g may cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year will contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists shou@@ ted about P@@ ru@@ ff &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to preserve this reasonable step by those responsible for protecting the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to encourage environmental pollution and its special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tumours celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 750 years St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche the old cemetery site in Tum@@ lingen am invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 16.@@ 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village , have made friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gen as their concern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it &apos;s a unique village jewel . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel was first mentioned in the state of Württemberg : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the &quot; Vo@@ gt@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard of Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wording of the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger Berg , apart from the former parish church , there was also a wonderful courtyard to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ ate right belonged and not vice versa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , there were also people there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf that are still visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement centre of the village . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old maps from the period around the year 1600 , under@@ pin these historical conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the earliest medieval estate law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this own church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; associated with it was the right to use a priest , or to propose a new pastor to the bishop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two zer@@ o@@ ed at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were cut and the bell pieces were stolen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the roof was leak@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops en@@ camp@@ ed near the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs , and used them as fire@@ wood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from the listener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 23 , the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was abandoned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only the church tower was left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the New Year &apos;s Eve , a storm broke out in 18@@ 34 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was abandoned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only the tower of Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g , which still exists today , remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Horst K@@ iss@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em care for Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn &apos;s successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as organisers , the friends and promot@@ ers invite Tum@@ lin@@ gen on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade at the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler University , Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with speeches by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann spoke to the local leader , Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann talks about the closing word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.@@ m .
admission is from 3 : 30 p.@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the conclusion of the Ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk is located in front of the cemetery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the woods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisers are hoping for many supporters for the receipt of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance to tum@@ ors and hearing @-@ collectors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the friends and pat@@ rons of Tum@@ lin feel particularly committed to their home care , including Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
non @-@ profit association wants to be approved by wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim , &quot; has been challenged by Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the club ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind power concentration camp at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within this concentration camp , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such zones should prevent a &quot; fru@@ stration &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided for a second wind turbine concentration area in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette for a few days before , but the district government of Düsseldorf was not approved because of a defect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of schedul@@ ing law , the granted approval decision is still illegal and therefore res@@ titu@@ tion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the summer break , the city council once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect , the issu@@ ance of a licence for the construction of wind turbines is excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been entered by a group of four since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared a spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the circle takes them to the occasion , to test the matter again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the group on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NE@@ W Re , a subsidiary of the NE@@ W , plans the construction of four 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer denom@@ ination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the company , where the city of Vier@@ sen was involved in the medium term , closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 @-@ hect@@ are site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the construction of four wind turbines , electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - roughly one fifth of the power requirement of all four @-@ person households . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
NE@@ W Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer there was green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Kreis Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
one horrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman was wounded , thereby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two more people were slightly injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to police numbers , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
city and merchants plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ aer and people from the region will re@@ discover the shops in the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commercial association and the municipal administration want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8th and 9th , in order to attract the residents to shopping in the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend will raise the customers awareness of what offers their own city has been allocated away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , local companies should present themselves with their apprenticeship places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are expected to invite midnight shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the campaign aims not only to residents of the city and the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend are Christian King . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the commercial association and the city enter a further stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to the well @-@ feast , with selling Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts to make them active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day , are part of the concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , customer potentials should be re@@ opened again or again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but many locals , too , would have lost the city centre while shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven the city centre - to land@@ lords , the businesses of the whole city and clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was rum@@ oured to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was partly broad@@ cast@@ ed , the king said in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Birgit St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the first third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities , took part in the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote the appreciation of local commerce and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action taking place under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her purchasing behaviour , its direct environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during construction , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new people were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis two people were killed and nine more injured , some of them heavy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , on Wednesday ( local time ) was still a wounded in critical condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed at the explosion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first , a missing person was later recovered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the dead , employees of the school were involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an un@@ fortunate thing , the authorities suspected works on a gas pipeline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the holiday time , only a few people stayed in the building of the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after si@@ ghted tran@@ scripts of telephone call Mexico , Tr@@ ump moved to Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia , were published by Washington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on January 27 , Tr@@ ump asked for a telephone call to the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US president insul@@ ted him because he publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t say the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and to leave Mexico for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also released and disclosed a tense exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia could be &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that had been given by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; dump@@ ing &quot; after he had proposed a ban on res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after having said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ore Ford massac@@ res : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act , as a call for justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury crossed a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the car , which had four black passenger and a white driver , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar , looking at the wind@@ shield . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inside , the occup@@ ants suspended in fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cry ri@@ pped the silence , when a young black man was dragged from the passenger &apos;s seat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , this terrible scene played on July 22 , is only one night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop around the neck is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all of the audience hit a real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists joined the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to mim@@ ic the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were settled by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really un@@ constitutional that in all these years no single person was arrested - even though we see them in our churches even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization of after@@ math . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old , former Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights activists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice has never been corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to eradic@@ ate , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court physician lays down a blanket over the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ x on July 27 , 1946 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to FBI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but no one ever was indic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , Ci@@ tiz@@ ers say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens in Georgia to give their vote for the first time in the summer election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the FBI the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com fell down a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , the FBI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when they approached the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the national and local prosecution that was not only involved in murder , removed evidence and viol@@ ated the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral massacre , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene was the leader of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her presentation is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant and is based in a kind of profound racism , of which many believe that he does not exist in America any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and yet more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors were crowded - a dozen white and the rest black - into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mar@@ bau@@ gh said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive , because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett d@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the high priest sh@@ outs and drives him fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , --- he , get away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then each ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; asked Ras@@ con@@ a .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think white people were &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the tough &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the scene will start again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N @-@ word , he says it sharply and with re@@ print . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this repetition is violent , fast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are cries , shots and then silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman suffering from a trauma , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and carries Bil@@ lie Holidays the sad song &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators catch sweat and tears from their eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they all experienced the humidity of Geor@@ gi@@ as for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the last notes of the song are sounding , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children ho@@ cks in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ bled a little boy as if he wanted to remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it is over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ ope and wipe off their tears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have done it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , the audience with the actors sit together for dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at one table , a white pair of Atlan@@ ta ch@@ ats about the post @-@ creation with a black couple that they have just met . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words , which the performance left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these horrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do this because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ching still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today this is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone thinks Broo@@ ks farm at his table , he eats and recalls the citizen &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the after@@ math is inspiring in a way that describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows an optional street corner together with the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the Rhine @-@ le@@ vers pos@@ ing as rock@@ ers , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acked oil barrels are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which is attracted by its &quot; ring &quot; production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three Rhein@@ murder@@ ers - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as well as in &quot; Das Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) seduc@@ ed a cor@@ pse in the trunk in Hollywood , giving the Kra@@ wall@@ o cli@@ que . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the gorgeous fi@@ st@@ ful Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a heavy @-@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he was terri@@ fied Siegfried .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must also believe it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with a strong applause .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a stor@@ my time , Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who hum@@ bled themselves and distorted the hands of the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is great applause for the Fest@@ spiel@@ haus , which is shown on stage for the first time - in view of the big heat in casual clothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eag@@ erly awaited , the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , he had to leave the organ of the pipe concert , five years later , in which the individual &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ chrom@@ at Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you realize that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it also has grown an understanding of its point of view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I draw a positive conclusion .
Max Gruppe is working as a volunteer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during their voluntary year , they work in several places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where anywhere ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture fair , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture lift . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I worked at school , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : it is a nice , wide range that I see here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are now 26 years old , so a late @-@ called volunteer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does that come about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amount : I have taken a high school graduation , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , I realized that it &apos;s the wrong and I want to do something different , work with people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then I asked myself , what do you do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do a social year since there is an insight , there you can see how it is , in the focal point maybe , really is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will study the dual degree , probably in the Youth Her@@ ne , a social worker training and studying at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different places during the volunteer service ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , it always depends on where you &apos;re going to be FS@@ J . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to make it from the retirement home to youth work , in all facets of social work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could see my own strengths , and see how it really works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is different from the civil engineering studies ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amount : well , here it is not a question of extra@@ pol@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again and again , there are other people in front of the head that have a completely different story behind them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - you always have to pay attention to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : for that , I am not the guy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is an area , which gives a lot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lots of love , lots of kindness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pear@@ son cuts more than 3,000 jobs and cut divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve business &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the job cuts , the general director John Fall@@ on mainly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , are in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , which sold its stake in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged from 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldier killed at suicide attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in Kab@@ ul , a soldier of NATO and injured several others , say officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five soldiers and one interpreter had been injured , and shared an explanation of NATO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians were killed in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Nato stance , the explosion on Thursday evening had happened as a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state , and in the U.S. military hospital on the air@@ field B@@ agra@@ m are treated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July , a suicide Motor@@ home killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite District of Kab@@ ul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban said , they would have executed this attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 pushed the Taliban out of power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump balances the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EPA converts decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay a regulation of Obama &apos;s government , which states that states are obliged to cur@@ b smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push the so @-@ called &quot; O@@ zone Rules 2015 , &quot; and said it showed the agency &apos;s obligation to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to determine where emissions have to be measured in a part of the country to meet stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of 15 most democratic states , along with the Colombia district , filed law@@ suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental conditions imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda driven by tr@@ ump economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have spark@@ ed the impact of Democrats and nature conservation groups who are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , reduces lung function and increases the respiratory symptoms , such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
community Council wants community space
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , the decision was clear : at two counter voices , the municipal council of Flu@@ o @-@ Win@@ ks decides to set up a communal space in the future retirement home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing land part is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the area of the church is still owned by the church community , there is no need for planning a plan for the project to be funded by a private investor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , there is a discussion of a common room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , offered to meet the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters floor space for a special price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council are suspended , such a common area should not be fores@@ een as a meeting point only for residents of the sen@@ i@@ ent living , but openly into the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; made the lap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision taken by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is in the refurb@@ ishment area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common room would be , so T@@ j@@ aden reports , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible for funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposed proposal is to signal the investor that in this respect it is not possible to throw a bil@@ let between the legs and the conclusion that both articul@@ ated - which is similar to the surrounding area - as well as the roof @-@ roof - which makes the construction more economical - it would be possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; need@@ less to say , it is not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , this addition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it helps : unanim@@ ously , it passes the board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings , with which one does not move so well , but now I lean against the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I &apos;m doing so badly with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking to the common room , but absolutely against municipal involvement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , it sees a concealed subsi@@ dy on either assets or even foreign investors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface , there is no subsi@@ dy , but a real value which is market@@ able in case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s motion to meet the proposed resolution is three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ voices in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; if we make the decision so , we make a giant leap to close a gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : Rad@@ ker is thrown on the road
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when crossing the street , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and was seriously injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the police announced , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road of the road Schwar@@ zer towards Hil@@ den on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Senior wanted to cross the road at the Buch@@ hol@@ zer Bus@@ ch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a passenger car driving in the same direction granted him priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Lan@@ gen@@ felder went to the road , he obviously did not notice the traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he joined a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suffered severe injuries , and was brought to a hospital by a ret@@ ou@@ ge wagon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce the Super@@ cup at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without him , the Super@@ cup will take place : David Al@@ aba has to leave the game against Dortmund . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with human resources , FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory play of the new season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8 : 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the German football champi@@ ons Bayern Munich will always be bigger with Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba in Du@@ eling with the B@@ V@@ B .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this confirmed the Italian , Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the mou@@ ths of Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six months , An@@ cel@@ otti has held responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his crew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ li@@ ma and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance within the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in an increase in performance in the first official match of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have great confidence , that my team shows these qualities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; An@@ cel@@ li@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights captiv@@ ates the fans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the game was sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin of star to star , hiking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin , the nation @-@ wide first &quot; star path &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the Association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andreas Berg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a planet trail in Göttingen , since 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accommo@@ dates the needs of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; members want to set up boards along the planned route , and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; well @-@ accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the information on the tables is to be completed by the internet , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , the Star@@ path Ticket should be extended by train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path , the viewer experiences a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more lumin@@ aire than another , although it is considerably farther away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which con@@ stellation it is possible to find a selected star , and when it is best to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2014 , the Association operates the highest situated observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy are clearly visible with naked eye . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2003 , there is something similar to the planned star@@ base - the planet &apos;s planet , since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
starting at the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e which forms the interior of our solar system the planet path leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the Observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; alien &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stel@@ a@@ es with the individual planets - including the degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point , are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a ball of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun &apos;s exactly 75 meters away measures 70 centimet@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the light from sun to plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans will need a good hour to stay with Plu@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the march to the next fixed star , however , would last half a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a potential show@@ down
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were in a collision course , were for the first time to stage under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight champion going down the hall@@ way to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko to the World Bo@@ xing Organization super @-@ fe@@ ather champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision about the former four @-@ Di@@ visi@@ oning World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how are you doing champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening , at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a former spring weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have asc@@ ended to bronze , but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to get down on light weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he has to move to light weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; , and then we fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
climate @-@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view as part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 @-@ 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also took interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans have asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and pressed openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko thought of the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the three combat champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly . I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus was to show impact strength , then boxing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both said they could sense the momentum , which arose for their own struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injuries to tire plat@@ ters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the connection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passenger got right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ turned and then stood on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the four occup@@ ants , two adults and two children , were badly injured in the accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in direction north for about one hour , then traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for 2 : 2 in the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optim@@ ises the defensive formation in Au@@ e points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the first season game Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , not the two opponents were against Braunschweig at 2 : 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to be more careful in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the supply chain should also be optimized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a gate after a kick @-@ off , the For@@ tun@@ en do not want to capture more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the tri@@ ke in preparation with the tri@@ ke , than with the four @-@ chain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is confident about his thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequisite is , however , that we are still more harmon@@ izing and we don &apos;t afford to do so many playback errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , Hoffmann moves to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak of a failed start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good start of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach did not want to know about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I leave the start into the season only after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who did not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be somewhat fres@@ her as they would have no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against one of the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know exactly where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner defence of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , guests from the Rhin@@ eland leave the Rhin@@ eland as a slight favorite on Sunday into the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to propose from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , Funk@@ el wants to see his players in no case on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ based application tests published
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started carrying out tests last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the asylum process , they should make a more precise assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for errors in judging the correct age of some refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person may &quot; possibly be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the exam@@ iner is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det investig@@ ates 5@@ 81 published results , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly stated that she was 18 years old this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method of medical age assessment , where X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they were earlier or later passed through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say , we should not do that as if we could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of evaluating a child as an adult is low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
working on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , a seven tonnes of heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Road and Traffic in the Regi@@ stered Pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April , work began at the same time on all three building @-@ dependent bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end of the building is scheduled for October , and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be kept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday morning , the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on the north side has received a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tonnes of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a marginal fastening , which is also used as a way of operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , a 2,@@ 20 @-@ metre wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the pedestrian walk@@ way will be gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing is that it is finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip feeling has required the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a fibre cable , connected to which many companies are connected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to the work , the local residents were informed about the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , fish and cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans had to be f@@ ished first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting pond towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is strictly regulated by a traffic light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bacher Location , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs for the three bridge installations are 700@@ ,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest with German potato salad
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t happen so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to get under a hat ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parties represented in the District Day ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a wide alliance that is peaceful in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the town @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain site but now takes place on the parking lot underneath the fund - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a colorful picture , that is there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the forum A world and one of the organizers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and plenty of food , among them a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; urine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato salad which could also eat the Af@@ D &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mario Hom@@ pes reports about the Af@@ D volcan@@ ei@@ fel , he took care of such an event and got the supplement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked for a cancellation in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so now the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ond@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also does : at 8 o &apos;clock a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle a lot of speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ elic Af@@ D @-@ Chairman Uwe Young . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are about 200 listeners in the hall , waiting for the candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k hold their speeches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a calm evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police can move - no special incidents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a goodbye with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli in the row Has@@ la@@ cher Mon@@ astic concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 o &apos;clock in the monastery church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ gem &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions , and have held positions in European top orchest@@ ras . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , Pet@@ kov solo@@ ist is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo voice of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the borders of different genres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new robe , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combined with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz singer N@@ ils W@@ ogram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this core of the program was premi@@ ered in Freiburg only this spring , with a huge success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the probably best known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues , Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately fell away bitter@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the female performer ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been in love with everyone I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think , I &apos;ve played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , it never confused me or obstruc@@ ted me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she suffered especially among them , according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in the school age , when she &apos;d rather dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that really hurt me , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think of myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , they don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to show yourself a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some might call me a vulner@@ ability , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump to change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manifestation broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to For@@ bes , Justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states , and his father inherited a coal business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of party by Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only fifteen provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last refusal of a party that is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , engaging message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ orable &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , commen@@ ded on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics chief D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes whom gold and silver med@@ als were cut off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized for itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ establishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress was made , but the congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will start at the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Director of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for res@@ etting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , he said reports in London after a speech at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
funeral p@@ act for soldiers cut off in Mali
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a funeral service in the North Hessen Frit@@ z@@ lar , about 1000 people of the two killed in Mali . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city , under high security measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of Defense , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she called the two opposite drivers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice provided by the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann of Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany , accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at noon , only the members of the Church took leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these include H@@ ess@@ ens &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier , CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stal@@ lions laid down roses , and the relatives were standing arm in arm in the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen , who described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and collap@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief of staff was established in Frit@@ z@@ lar , Germany , and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots in his regi@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment belonging to the soldiers said : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mali , there was no doubt about the UN mission in Mali : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the funeral ceremony , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the occasion of the Royal House , on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Queen was willing to accept her husband &apos;s decision , and she continued her message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be not yet known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret , that he was not happy with his title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become King . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , he retired and entered the title &quot; Prin@@ ces Communi@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Hen@@ rik had not received the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not after death , declared L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish Royal House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where the last resting place of the 83 year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he likes the country , for which he worked in the last 50 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French nobility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a serious stand with the Dan@@ es in his nearly 50 years of reign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik expressed over the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Danish was floating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation in this country to be the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I seemed to be content with this position , and not to be ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister @-@ President Wei@@ l wants swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , but does not want to withdraw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , he spoke for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Parliament in Nieder@@ sachsen over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five months before the official date of the state election , the red @-@ green coalition lost their scar@@ ce one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Green Party , El@@ ke T@@ ern , founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election of 2018 in their election circuit in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she announced on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group President Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its faction to take it up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that means that CD@@ U and F@@ DP have 69 seats in the Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the relationship was reversed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new parliament will be elected on January 14 , 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must decide whether it could continue to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable , however , that the Land@@ tag decides as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the Minister @-@ President , parliament , chooses the trust and chooses a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be legally tested , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; West &apos;s step &quot; but a bit strange . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian herself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she called herself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens urged the stub@@ born parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their country of land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume , of course , that they have received their agricultural trade which they have received via the green state list with immediate effect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; dismissed the president Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we greatly regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she consciously decided not to speak any pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
s &amp; D candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Gre@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , to quickly re @-@ elect the Land@@ tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exit of T@@ we@@ ens , in Lower Saxony , costs the majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her injured vanity and her fru@@ stration , her personal interests against the good of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; critic@@ ised the secretary general Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a scandal that CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dutch CD@@ U leader , Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ ange to the CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , presented v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the result of the State Parliament election 2013 with a personal career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U was then the strongest force in the SPD , the SPD and the Green Party had a very thin majority of a vote in the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany talks about contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal pass ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) talks with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp printing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder provide the latest information about the affected eggs bat@@ ches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if according to everything we currently know , a health hazard is practically impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is Al@@ di now taking over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has set up immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the const@@ ern@@ ation of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , trade has as well to ensure that the products sold are portable and safe to health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the residual hardness of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are non @-@ transpor@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ polluted eggs , however , can be sold and consumed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , not the companies are to blame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the present level of knowledge , the production plants do not meet any immediate fault . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they have to expect economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always , there is too little control in the harvest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it lacking only on the personnel , or in the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were , however , the official controls that have revealed the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out to be 100 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; precisely because of this , consistent enlightenment of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases in which off@@ ences can be present are of decisive importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear that I expect incomplete clarification from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm system really necessary for food sandals ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to get only safe and transpor@@ table food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ accredited insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly indign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by means of the pan@@ eled funds , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ feeding animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at all levels , it must be worked consistently and with high pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from all relevant authorities , I expect the facts to be solved quickly and without gaps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how Fis@@ cal Rules of Football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ving to Paris
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rules , aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded expenses of European football clubs , will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious champi@@ ons league tournament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point , that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from their contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G can make money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar signs and bring him into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the rich royal family of Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but they need to counter@@ act legitimate income sources that allow them the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini , after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners returned their support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from the concentration on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to build a global brand , becoming a harder affair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the current three @-@ year publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even though Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ idency of the presidential elections in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be frigh@@ tened of excessive spending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause by N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract so that the revenues for the next five years will be recorded in the amount of 4@@ 4,@@ 4 million euros in the annual financial statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first wave of EU pen@@ alties in 2014 brought the PS@@ G to Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could attempt to outs@@ m@@ art their financial supervision by blo@@ ating their revenue from businesses , which are associated with the owners of a club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while a cat could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as a legitimate income . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA sponsor was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar WM will be am@@ bass@@ adors and a similar manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could be easy to find out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announced on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of € 5@@ 4@@ 2.4 million , generated a profit of more than 10 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association anticip@@ ates that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last property of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arsen@@ al @-@ manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sports Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country owns an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the finan@@ ci@@ er Fair@@ play because you can have different paths or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss is looking for a new Scho@@ oling supplier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has produced chocolate for Swiss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline sets the order anew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott , on request of the news agency s@@ da , confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the products were reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 17 million small red @-@ white , wrapped chocolate panels spread to 14 grams per year before landing to the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss didn &apos;t want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ der insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs , and Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer , it is a prestigious order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many applicants , Swiss does not want to disclose it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , only Swiss manufacturers come into question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y intends to renew a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2006 , Swiss companies have been distributing chocolate bars on board their flights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied the chocolate tablet in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two and a half years ago , Swiss had the opportunity to place the logo at the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the airline is co@@ operating with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on long @-@ haul flights , the First Class customers are spoiled with treats from the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class wet passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is also distributing on the short track , both in Business and Economy Class . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
athle@@ tics - Olympic champion Robert Hart@@ ing achieves World Cup final
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday , the three @-@ time World Champion fights for a medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his brother Christoph , Olympic Champion of 2016 , had failed in the national championship competition and could only look at the disc@@ us competition from the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also with the first attempt , the Polish title defender Pi@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ach@@ owski , who threw 6@@ 5,@@ 13 metres far , qualified for the final fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this repetition of history is nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of characters of the 80 &apos;s , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our fac@@ ebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as fran@@ chise , it feels as if the time is short . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not just because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained a original story for a speaking can of vegetables spoken by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by stiff@@ ening at the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play dirty children who grow up - nevertheless , they managed to gain the im@@ possibility to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater &quot; with his adults playing adults now is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the casting conversion principle including a riff on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at one point a character sticks through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the like@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ evil plot involved in Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always , the courses are the best part of fran@@ chise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ on &apos;s under@@ cover art of &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could heat this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches that which I consider as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater &quot; whose last scene will show the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West Ring @-@ War icon@@ ography .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , is a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ fle@@ dged Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are being played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogs by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English are du@@ b@@ bed .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are some nice g@@ ags for watching ( the police sp@@ ends time to watch chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Fin@@ de the voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is included - that it often plays like one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six long episodes , it pul@@ ls away and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; who was re@@ directed to a lower length could better deliver its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , as Greg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef are always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message for the imagined Communist public is , that Western culture can do everything to feed for a money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fic@@ ti@@ tious Rum@@ anian cre@@ ators were not wrong , we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police succeeded in a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifteen of them were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 , and arrest warran@@ ts were issued against them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the officers put greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of time @-@ like ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against the two susp@@ ects , there were German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the two are presumably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the summer of 2016 , Kon@@ stanz &apos;s public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trafficking in southern Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the prosec@@ utor in Con@@ stance and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil were almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the large @-@ scale use was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the investigation was , above all , Italian nation@@ als with regard to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired up early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
way complain large gaps in the for@@ eigner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners tab in Germany shows substantial fla@@ ws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions regarding asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a media report , the representative for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , made aware of large gaps in the country @-@ central register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the data recorded there could lead to some serious short@@ com@@ ings in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , thus in an analysis published in the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the data , ten million people are registered with foreign nationality , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the data are administered by approximately 600 foreign nation@@ als in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the data had not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 was found , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data inputs can significantly slow down returns processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics of sufficient people there are also EU citizens who wouldn &apos;t have to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false assignments lead to a distorted debate on how to deal with adequate funding , &quot; says the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results from an internal paper published by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , BA@@ MF practices such procedures &quot; concerning families with children , with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - by Italy since 1st June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was on site under reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU is responsible for refugees from the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a migrant worker travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country of appeal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason , the office now writes : &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy submitted guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ t@@ HR ) , consider these commitments sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU countries , too , would return refugees to the Dublin Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the Left Opposition in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threaten un@@ lawful detention conditions and a threat to child &apos;s welfare due to the defects in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 220 liters of blood from in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service already provided for other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least among the twelve citizens , who were honored on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who with his 100 donations has now divided 50 litres of blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is built for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available for foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the district leader of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , as the preserved foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported from the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 chips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher atten@@ de@@ es only a few years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a moved to the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 years of blood donations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England is likely to announce that interest rates remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened the speculation about an increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish , while keeping interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates down to 0.@@ 25 % , although weaker economic growth has weakened support for an increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary income is expected to rise to just under 3 % in autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation suggested by the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that credit costs would have to increase more than expected at the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut stimulus package , which was published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that they will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice since the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; would be required for inflation and a &quot; greater &quot; scope than markets would expect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; would be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts adjusted down@@ wards for this and next year are 1.9 % , compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after these news , the pound fell compared to the dollar and the euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations for a price increase , and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the end of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by increasing inflation and slight increase in wages , as the tightening first becomes worse before it gets better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy could not &quot; prevent income from income in the coming years , &quot; but she added that wages can be rec@@ uper@@ ated at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pounds , which is offset by a proportion of lower consumer spending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes a year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the decline of the P@@ act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years , until this will fully reach the prices and the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rates rose because inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers called for an increase to 0.5 % in July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inflation decreased in June last month from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said it was expected and will attract them back in the coming months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the exceeding in proportion to their goal of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to be more competitive again as the len@@ ders want to end in a positive way and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks very good for those in which the existing deals are exp@@ iring and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are complete , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from September after a fight against the drug , patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the High Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) introduced prior to sexual intercourse can now reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by approximately 86 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chess campaign announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d become the first to make registration of people and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines that are taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduced HIV transmission in case of infection .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such medications can be taken every day , or so , two hours before sexual intercourse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who ask for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in hospitals there are identified participants that agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who live in England and are registered with a family physician , can also opt @-@ in for possible participation at their local participating sex clinic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program will award £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the drugs this week , following an international competitive sourcing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as it is widely used , recorded and implemented on a large scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in dealing with one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ p , if it is targeted specifically on needy and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner that leads to the improvement of many lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was acquired , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Shadow Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ itation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evidence shows how to transform this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention , and the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection can end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is conducted as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this apartment was shown to me in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne &apos;s storage space and a mezzanine , to use the generous ceiling height optimally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ lap , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which you could stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan had to think creative , to solve the issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height , with much additional drama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it look longer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by exercising a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing about this is , that it is a garage door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is opposite so that when you push the door , it is very easy to gli@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a vesti@@ gi@@ al form , a real estate agent will enter and perform calculations based on soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here they managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which help create an emotional bond in a home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter number , from some standard in something quite astonishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two brothers find four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute about one of the largest real estate agents of Victori@@ as valued above 500 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton football club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ co lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets are to be divided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estates in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a business in the Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood family since 1973 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , West@@ co &apos;s family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ be &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following an agreement with her deceased father , Col@@ in - by Paul , is described as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul approximately one third . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court file states that this means that Col@@ in &apos;s property has $ 3@@ 16 million , and Paul has $ 17@@ 6 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Paul , the division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Friday , after several failed attempts , the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , like Paul claims to exclude him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but raises Paul to manage some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost increases , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held by law firms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they took advantage of the safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood @-@ Property , in the Col@@ in the first je@@ ans@@ ke of the family opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anna De Lu@@ cy says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , and Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luke , as well as Mark are , &quot; Paul says about the conditions of her financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in has kept very reluct@@ ant , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media received contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; I can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and dress our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , this hope seemed to be over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others have tried , and have failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on an even less course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , gathered at his first work day with senior staff , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House that he wanted to repair : bad information that got into the hands of the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kel@@ ly said that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings , because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring its media diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television goes back for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were too convincing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time , Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote that &quot; the key to keeping Twitter custom s@@ ling@@ ers under control , according to six former electoral campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady rate of praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al@@ right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ ump &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know others , that Tr@@ ump T@@ we@@ ets would have contained more fuel without their interventions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets , the dump has not sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if his associates ate it several times to keep anger from him , their efforts have paid off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no @-@ one has been able to prevent Tr@@ ump controversi@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by promoting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ co - very busy with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ dile@@ ction of the couns@@ ell@@ ors , the president for strategic reasons to supply du@@ bi@@ ous information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an example , described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone accused the President of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of Internet Pro@@ voc@@ ative Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief cler@@ k K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Johnson was banned from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump las the article , and began asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did this work ?
Kel@@ ly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the population will pray and hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this summer , the police in all of Europe are sent postcards to dangerous criminals on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the addresses of the searched heavy criminals are not known in nature , information from the population will be hoped and asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol on Friday reported from the action , which follows the &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar from the winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the experiences showed that many fle@@ ets were hiding in destinations , called Euro@@ pol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have put together 21 postcards for criminals from 21 EU countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2016 there is the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times it was viewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 of the online hym@@ ns have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them after publishing on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos; series
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again facing some determined trav@@ eller on war@@ base , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the church in order to rec@@ laim a field from their mansion houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy road of Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; Million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters once they were thrown out in May , without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch dug by the Council to prevent their attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defence systems and pressed their vehicles through a section , which remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry inhabitants urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said , &quot; They went there on Monday evening after they were sent out of Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced to implement execution as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved forward and are now back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more came last night , probably even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my local tax if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resident who did not want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the figures have increased this time , and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised bearing on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we seize the necessary legal steps so that they move on as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house in front of Freu@@ den@@ stadt gates is undergoing renovation , and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are good news for the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through the then Ambiente operating company lt@@ d. on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 nights were lost per year as well as revenues through the tourist tax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fall of 2014 , in light of dramatic rising numbers of refugees entering the county , the hotel building was offered to the District Office as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by installing a development plan , in order to secure the area as a hotel location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but above all , Freu@@ den@@ stadt leader Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel site and already spoke of serious potential buyers in the house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was to be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with Director Birgit Sch@@ erer with seat in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ ise Park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings are partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until March , there is still much to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is converted , new windows are installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , it emphasizes Sch@@ erer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms is set to set up , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people will feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourist Director Michael Kr@@ ause have already led , so Sch@@ erer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of the city is identical to those of the hotel group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the amount of investment required , Thomas Sch@@ erer is not willing to set out exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just under a million euros , he calcul@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the outdoor facilities are also brought forward , which is already clearly visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a courtyard , a large terrace is created which will be accessible from the restaurant which is open to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us Special Issu@@ er sets out Grand Jury
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Russia affair about US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special negoti@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the committee recorded the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal , &quot; referring to the matter entrusted to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the paper took the step as a sign , that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified his investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transmitter CN@@ N reported , there are already the first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between the el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
us intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time trying to intervene in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mu@@ eller studied , if there were agreements between Tr@@ ump campaign team and Moscow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of the investigation , several men are expected to act as advis@@ ers of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller did more and more tr@@ umps as a private and business environment among the lou@@ pe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the Special Agent was in the center and searched for the accus@@ ation whether the president was possibly imp@@ eded by the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand J@@ uries is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases , and to decide whether an indictment is to be raised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Grand J@@ uries are also called the dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the time , they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the body can be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to take the oath under oath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to CN@@ N , invitations were already issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who participated in the meeting , were asked to make a statement , called it in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. were also Coun@@ try@@ side couns@@ ell@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his former election director Paul Man@@ a@@ fort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in U.S. television , that the setting show that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that he should act quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the institution of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for President Tr@@ ump should be concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amid the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to represent Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the democr@@ ats a possibility to &quot; feel good , &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he also work in secret places , he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any action that accelerated the work of the special agent in a fair manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times , that not against the President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no reason to believe that something has changed , and it continued to explain in the explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Mu@@ eller was first used , after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this cra@@ ddle , repro@@ aches against Tr@@ ump became lou@@ dly , he did want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June ahead of a Senate committee , Com@@ ey asked him to stop the investigation against the national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the investigation , the president is under great pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this triggered spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller was dischar@@ ged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike an independent special agent of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair about the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position where he could theoretically be fired on margins of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented legislation on Thursday , after which the special agent could not be dismissed so easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Antar@@ ctic : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg from the narrow@@ ly 7th mag of Berlin has loos@@ ened itself from the ice shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for polar and marine research on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kol@@ oss , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion of tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now heading north and will probably need two or three years until it was melted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 km , it is one of the largest ice farms that researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from him , there is no danger for people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the polar bear , research data remains unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , however , a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for some 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ tual background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the col@@ os@@ sal col@@ os@@ sus was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s swi@@ ms along the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consequently , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the north of this ice shelf , the balance of growth and ab@@ rupt was disturbed a few years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a complete shame is falling down there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fest is in danger , as the front edge has never gone back as far as it is currently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not hei@@ gh@@ ten the sea level as they float on the water and squee@@ ze ice as much water as it produces after melting itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and much faster than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could possibly increase sea level , albeit only in a small degree , writes the British research project to observe Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , it breaks regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural event and has no direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now entering a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most popular withdrawal since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s would grow back or fall over the long term , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though these explor@@ ers do not decline this giant ic@@ e@@ berg &apos;s departure to climate change , there have been many ice @-@ fires in the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula in recent decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this long top of Antar@@ cti@@ ca extends towards South America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the data of the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rise in temperature contributed to the decline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees and ranks among the areas where the temperature is fastest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U wants to make a ho@@ ur@@ ly tariff for personnel
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U ur@@ ges to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new positions in the administration were tra@@ cked through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 1,@@ 100 employees and civil servants work for the administrative district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , 17 trainees have their first working day behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apprentices@@ hips at the circle are obviously very popular .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this year , around 6@@ 20 applications were to be recorded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the group is still lacking staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , there are 50 un@@ occupied places in M@@ ett@@ mann district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , doctors and engineers and forces of general administration are sought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U , together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , wants to take the initiative and counter the shortage of skilled labour in the administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wish of the parties , the administration will develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term needs of skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented candidate scar@@ city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overall concept should focus internally and externally , demonstrate concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that sounds like a good approach , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the circle has to do with personal problems , which you did not know earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees , offering more attractive conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who ex@@ crete disease or age due to service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so high time to act , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ op@@ les , President of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint request with his party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he cat@@ ered for a bad surprise for a long time already in the circle of the circle , when he publicly challenged personnel costs and start@@ led the other parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be checked , which allow an exit from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not arrive at a satisfactory solution at short notice , the district administration with the unions should strive for a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate even in cooperation with the county @-@ related cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials than the public service is actually looking for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money only exists if one changes to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees deal with the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , by the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone on NGO migrants &apos; rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew had worked effectively with men &apos;s traders in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express a detailed alle@@ gation by the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised , after collecting all information and assessing the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is suspected that his crew is aboard infl@@ atable boat migrants , which can be delivered directly from men &apos;s dealers and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the occupation is suspected of being over@@ seen by the authority of the Italian coast guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta have to have an Italian police officer on board , who supervis@@ es their activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only three of the nine NGOs , who are involved in search and rescue operations , have so far been willing to remember the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily , but acceptable as they would not bring any major changes or im@@ pedi@@ ments to their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation is Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ es@@ ota said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had declined dramatically in recent weeks , which meant that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berliner out@@ posts &quot; and two drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz , to enjoy Tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for that , three friendly guides were available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during hot summer temperatures , the first tour took place along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in between , there were repeat@@ ed@@ ely longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the second day , I went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again , the look@@ out point went up to the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flakes &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refresh@@ ments brought welcome breaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed healing br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , Neu@@ stadt was controlled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 meters of altitude , the group met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga ru@@ sts for e @-@ sport
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles , instead of struggling with wind and weather over the stadium racing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages inclusive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these have also recognized the first Bundes@@ liga , who are increasingly involved in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports division in mid @-@ July and two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game took place under contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to am@@ a@@ ze completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Management Board Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that some clubs are still climbing on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen , meanwhile , advises an agency for virtual football players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially Asian countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , you could be present online far more often in these markets than once a year to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in e @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or the FIFA @-@ simulation are promoted to competition level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long ago , as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has established itself in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with the 2022 World Cup , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but is it a kind of sport , anyway ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a long time , In@@ go F@@ rob@@ atic has dealt with the question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sports is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions which one can also find in classical sport - for example increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it needs cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and rapid re@@ activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; professional gam@@ ers should train their body not only on the console , but also to exercise their body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ atic also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; controls are difficult to carry on in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a positive way , the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players are internationally active , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study of Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that € 50 million has been implemented in Germany in 2016 , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three years , turnover is expected to exceed 130 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , that is little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the e @-@ sport is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internationally , many countries are already continuing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Europe , too , things are happening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ bery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Netherlands and France , the soccer club clubs according to D@@ utt have meanwhile been obliged to set up an E @-@ Sports Department . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany la@@ gs behind , &quot; says V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to decay only in nostal@@ gia , and to clear the old times , is no longer enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to it that everything remains as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poison eggs - The egg @-@ alternatives , for cooking and baking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , almost all federal states are affected by the scandal surrounding pois@@ oned eggs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ di Süd and Al@@ di Nord have re@@ acted , and all eggs were taken from the sale in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in regi@@ ments , only eggs should only be taken that do not contain any fi@@ pron@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter was sentenced to suicide because of the lyrics , the Con@@ rad Roy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and spent five years exposed to par@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for the alleged kidn@@ apping of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing , &quot; My family is in@@ consol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until his appointment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had been suffering from a mental illness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and facing down eyes when she was sentenced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance , &quot; which she completely depl@@ ores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz , however , said he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental disease had a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy saying that there is &quot; no day , &quot; in which I did not smoke the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity to be there for his sisters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gary &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , told her that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s marriage or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this single person , with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain I will always keep in store for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case drew national attention after Car@@ ter &apos;s text messages revealed , that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang yourself , hop on a building , get up yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in moments before suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; All you need to do is turn off the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was paid by the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from any press .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , the legal opinion is shared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the few who defended Car@@ ter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder in Italy in 2007 , was sentenced to two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter mer@@ ges compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ ley was allowed to run the Audi Cup as captain , is no accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FC Bayern did a great season for the Con@@ fed Cup winner , too - extra motivation does not harm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something was different on his place in the cabin , he saw Joshua Kim@@ i immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , there was no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner told him after his first deployment as a Bayern captain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the sign from the coach could point Kim@@ i , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been selected as a leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , a player of youth , de@@ but@@ ant and just a holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sugar is best distributed to those of whom you trust a lot , which you want to keep in your mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who have been chosen to take the legacy of Lah@@ ore , can use a little extra motivation only well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old te@@ amed the field as a mini @-@ lam@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right back , that &apos;s his position , the white ties on the arm did the rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and at all , Kim@@ i was working in this formation as the one who can best take the helm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated trou@@ pe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had a view to the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his inability to over@@ play his missing fitness , Ren@@ ato San@@ ches pointed to the devil coming out of the achievements of Asia &apos;s journey ( also due ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le were not neg@@ atively charged at their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ cot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , it worked quite well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted master@@ fully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the familiar Nap@@ oli storm often took a hard time , and sw@@ ells also tried a few times in the build @-@ up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result wasn &apos;t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he also showed a decent performance during the debut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; game storage , tempo change : &quot; I was also fet@@ ched for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how un@@ familiar this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new arri@@ vals , one looked after the game afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ru@@ dy for example did not give one or two in the Cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but for six or seven interviews . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i said goodbye to his new players , after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ ver : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here I already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al@@ aba , motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ La@@ dies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just before the game about Twitter , Austria &apos;s most famous football club has been reported about Twitter and the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies wished all the best . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bavaria @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire is a quasi @-@ club of Ö@@ F@@ B captains in Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck , and fe@@ ather@@ ed with our La@@ dies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ we@@ et of the Austrian football tournament of the year , and the Champions League tournament , should be a special motivation sy@@ ringe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our ladies might need the famous Bayern D@@ us@@ el , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister , Economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ dom Tempo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still was Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is reflected in more than a year , in which the new Economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy on T V @-@ enquiry - and simultaneously add the old Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke has blocked all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest down@@ turn looks natural in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the ministry hopes to set out a plan for planning , until 2021 is expected to rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the western direction of Trier also plays a role in the plans of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ ums@@ feld , Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nat@@ us sees this as a guide to support regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier seeks to promote the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports that have been torn down for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , pra@@ ises I@@ HK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the new Master Bonus , the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier provides an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a premium of 1000 euros is planned for the passed exam and 2500 euros , if graduates become self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the planned road construction , there are quick facts to create facts , at the same time fail to meet the country at the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , more than 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who wish to set Wis@@ sing in the country &apos;s business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber is calling for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on top of that , CD@@ U Group vice Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the accounting system , the country is more than 20 million euros less than proposed in the maintenance of regional roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Frank nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept as to how to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the current broadband expansion in the country is sober@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , regional companies rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score 3.4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compla@@ ined about pitch @-@ like internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , ex @-@ economic minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits in the supervisory board of the wind force company Pro Wind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she already cleared the field after four months of dis@@ agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Audi is to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers see themselves confronted with a counter reaction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day prior to Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chair@@ person of the BMW Group said that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe , in order to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the nitrogen oxi@@ des em@@ itted by diesel engines , are known as carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of autom@@ akers to install systems for neutr@@ al@@ ising exhaust f@@ umes , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen to comply with the use of so @-@ called switch @-@ off devices to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the United States several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the Audi engine development in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be brought to court in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi to install a system to b@@ ypass emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States was expanded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the involvement of Audi in the study could burden Volkswagen heavily : the luxury car manufacturer , dispro@@ portion@@ ately , contributes to Volkswagen &apos;s profit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft is going through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you go to Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this is not a nasty raft , with Is@@ ar Tour@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the building of the building is to be clari@@ fied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the raft , one sees a large inf@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; True Love , &quot; the understanding of the Icel@@ an@@ dic fauna is to be sharpen@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last summer , the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ dil@@ los , rab@@ ies and laughter for the suffering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the best published carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons , the rab@@ bit n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also with 85 , the Argent@@ inian is still drawing and working on a film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laugh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 4 August 1932 , Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first few years as an artist , he was among other things , as a sign for congrat@@ ul@@ atory cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day I lost in my job , &quot; he once said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded in the late &apos; 60s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then in &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the early morning , according to his own information , he still sits on the desk today , works nearly ten hours a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches still find their dro@@ ves figures worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years , he has also been working on a cartoon and TV series with his characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los is the most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thous@@ and@@ ler as a counter @-@ player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film that should come to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;re saying , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced word@@ lessly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the conditions which are remembered against drought , the la@@ ven@@ der is decreasing due to the insects that are transmitted to drought , leading to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years and much more in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small ci@@ ca@@ ine , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transfers d@@ warf ads , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only attracted to holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slow@@ ing down evap@@ oration from the soil , but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resili@@ ent to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in Thur@@ in@@ gia R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 years of existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Saturday and Sunday , Fes@@ th@@ öh@@ highlight is a medieval festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dealers , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ inas or a camp care camp should be experienced in the city centre these days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the murder of a journalist , under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees of the weekly ri@@ odo@@ ce normally meet in order to check their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was told them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades or leave them at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room : opponent , Neut@@ ral , ally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they ask the re@@ porters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and gut feelings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of being on the pay@@ roll of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no rest of violence , and while throughout the country the bodies are accum@@ ulating , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 years since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to res@@ igned in December 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the latter is their editor and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere present - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice . &quot; two re@@ porters in the 1930s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts expos@@ ing their smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ ama ut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a special Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 to address the cases of journalists , it has initiated only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , each year linked to drug trafficking and organised crime , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ consol@@ able and although the terrain is still more treas@@ on@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without information about murder@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we di@@ str@@ ust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cont@@ actor drove away in his car , and damaged it nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in January last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival fac@@ tions struggle here to fill the vacuum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that every day someone or more people are shot on the street every day , or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control of the coastal state with its precious ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival anti@@ trust fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this release may upset the sons , gu@@ essed gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez , after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , to leave the country for its own security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted , that he would always be there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drugs problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for its bold and honest coverage , and sales and advertising increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ porters loved to be able to publish highly accurate investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J distinction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that you want as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the odo@@ urs team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and counsel , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , they wonder : was his love for the routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his death , too , forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their job and stay alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you engage with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it smells false , stay away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ ci@@ ce Andr@@ es Vil@@ lar@@ real said &quot; smell a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the cause is happening with Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer regarded as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; days before became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building , in a mid @-@ size district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who called the governor himself as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months ago since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has posted three main stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was the assassination of the brother of the former well @-@ known boxing writer Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez , Sin@@ alo@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also had an expos@@ é to the state expenditure , which concentrated on the governor &apos;s hom@@ etown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , leading a kidn@@ apping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vil@@ lar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this place , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military raid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez had seen the best informed source about kidn@@ apping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we knew what happened , &quot; said Vil@@ lar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration , for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der of volume by writing in organised protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington , trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy out journalists and kill them because they have said the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then she has asked that she is again divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , involved in government officials and a valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were infected with organised crime under a blanket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the Media W@@ äch@@ ter@@ gruppe &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists and police officers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as at the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to their separate head , a computer keyboard and head@@ phone were used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some stores have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others continue , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the murder of her director in 2004 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publi@@ ci@@ zed the drug cart@@ els with a leading article on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists have fled from their native countries , or even from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a painful decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , indicates that the drug trafficking is frigh@@ tened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began hum@@ ming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with riv@@ eted riv@@ ets and security forces close to the seaside resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the war continued to escal@@ ate , as promised by a number of cart@@ el em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the side of the cur@@ b , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren how@@ ls nearby - another shooting in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , looking at the polic@@ emen who kept guards to see if they were willing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they were scared at all , they did not show it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if on the same day when Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ ak to avoid his enemies
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , if also a frigh@@ tening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain worker have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even notice that his fla@@ ky skin was red@@ dish brown , and they said she had had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report in Current Bi@@ ology was described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and one of the world &apos;s best din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ din@@ osau@@ r , which lived in the middle of the circle period between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has amazed scientists who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable , &quot; per@@ plex@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil in its kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he dug near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on 21 March 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ hen@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal inside the 2,500 Po@@ und ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is ready now to be revealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you just blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at Royal Ty@@ rr@@ hen@@ ell Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researchers have found that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a shifting tank , are likely to be threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used an shiel@@ ding technique known as counterpart , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ hen@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was darker than their under@@ side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs are ch@@ ased by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ aling of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and vulnerable to prey , which sign@@ alizes that this no@@ dos@@ ry was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors of the circle had to have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red@@ dish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on information about his life , including its con@@ served colon , to find out what it has eaten as its last meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , got into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank down to the sea floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as Süd@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ din@@ osau@@ r is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early cycle time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just sc@@ are a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is in sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that stood on two legs crossed the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists whose latest findings appear in Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he dug near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on 21 March 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the museum , it is the besi@@ eg@@ ed arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ik@@ es resting from his shoulders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were em@@ med by Western Canada , until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ rs kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the remains of this special specimen are preserved in such a way , that the cut@@ est still cover b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a profit in Lot@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I approach it , the more confusing it becomes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stored remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured sheets , carrying the skull of the animal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales on his sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
serious accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass cam@@ shaft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous wounded , kilometres long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured during a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the late Thursday afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the first information of the police at 5 p.m. between the annex@@ es Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , almost 30 vehicles , including trucks , crashed into each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first , no information was given to the exact number of injured parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a matter of light to moderate injuries , said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large b@@ ail@@ out of life@@ jackets was at the accident site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the direction of Munich , the A@@ 8 was completely closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the direction of travel in Munich , a round ten kilometres long was formed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like an A@@ Z journalist , it was also on the opposite way to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade not@@ ated the characteristics of the vehicle sli@@ ders , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly after 6 : 45 p.m. , another second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : you sit in the train , and sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or one is deep@@ ened in his work , and has just a brilliant idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then : buffer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conductor comes and w@@ akes up an uns@@ ur@@ passed , or pul@@ ls the passenger in the midst of the workflow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , the Deutsche Bahn is testing the free ticket control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is simply confirmed by mobile phone , that you take your seat and upgrade the ticket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , a trial runs on two routes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer comes , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in , &quot; the train calls the ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to use them , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you have to book an online ticket , which is what most passengers do anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you also have to purchase it via the app of the train , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket booking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and finally , you need a seat reservation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one climbs in the train , calls his ticket to &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the test customers , a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on their mobile devices , the train guides get a message that passenger X is on the train and has taken the seat Y reserved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the train driver arrives at the ticket inspection at Place Y , he knows that a passenger is sitting there with an online ticket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so you can continue to sleep , keep on working , keep silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train , which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train crew , just check out in the DB Navig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Director of DB Cor@@ respon@@ dence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who travels often , knows that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest occasions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , however , one of the fellow travelers did not have all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either the credit card or the identity card is missing , or otherwise a document that you have to show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is endless discussions between the passenger and passenger , which leads to poor sen@@ timent in the part or large room and delays in the control of your own ticket and the conductor at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies only to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Ferr@@ ell was shaken to its core . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that they rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on their phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confused , as nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a user with the hand@@ ler @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly working on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old man killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s lifel@@ ess body , which was executed on the street and would remain there for four hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Ferr@@ ell thought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but death was nothing new to them , and their community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she stopped her cell phone in order to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field drive later in the evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father , who bore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons Police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she watched a live feed at which a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll kill you ... animals all kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ferr@@ ell remembered her testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the sort of murder that we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this moment , I felt shi@@ vers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 23 o &apos;clock , she took her six @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that they would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened during the next three years with Ferr@@ ell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the topic of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and power of resistance , which live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Ferr@@ ell with her daughter who carried a flower dress and a fitting crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take her away , &quot; Ferr@@ ell said later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must know , and it must be seen and raised in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be well developed , not just activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if I &apos;m lucky to give her an experience , in which she personally experiences no blat@@ ant racism , she is no different than the next black women &apos;s child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp@@ ground , when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Offic@@ ers Wilson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , Ferr@@ ell and her daughter joined a local business owner , who made lunch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they prepared the pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slowly , a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Ferr@@ ell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism totally changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
it has all come . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weeks later , Ferr@@ ell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Tor@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to only &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question came Ferr@@ ell in the sense : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community prof@@ ited by their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered on their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked together with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct in@@ mates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his commitment brought Ferr@@ ell the project closer , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we are talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me how these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah guide but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life as they fall in love and marry their wife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt as naked , &quot; Ferr@@ ell said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understand that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s story repeatedly repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black women gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ferr@@ ell said , &quot; and therefore we constantly fight on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chosen by Ferr@@ ell as a heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a coincidence , even though it was at the forefront because of a life on these crosses than a black , gay woman standing so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the message cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the rac@@ ist links between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ferr@@ ell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years , due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the soci@@ opoliti@@ cal atmosphere of the region , which she calls her home : &quot; a mess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels obliged to this memory , since she went on the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bit gallery moves people , although it is not yet built for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone , since the first presentation of 2009 , divi@@ des the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cold , the subject hardly leaves one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while one to say a bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That &apos;s really cool &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , coming from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while advoc@@ ates build a gallery attracting more customers to the city , of which the other businesses profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the property on which the farmer market hall is located , in which 13 direct markets offer their products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the beginning of the construction work , it will end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with possibility to sit outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one Rooms : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been selling almost every week in the peasant market for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the ma@@ i@@ dens are always happy again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have also discovered the but@@ chers shop for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would wish that even during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other cities , there is also this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing will settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the shopping mall in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ store or supermarket : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of that , there are already enough in our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you see , how many stores are empty here - some for months and years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the goods offered there are mostly offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive above all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger firms , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retailer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a pity , specialty stores almost no longer exist and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wolf F@@ andel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , where is the peasant market hall planned during the construction period ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit gallery is actually coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or does it create the Spec@@ tr@@ es bit gallery before , to drive all shops out of Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it just won &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a shopping center that stands empty , doesn &apos;t need anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the amaz@@ ingly many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the peasant market hall is damaged , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible - which hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of che@@ eks and hair@@ cuts sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the c@@ utt@@ ings out of Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison term after being publicly funded by the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new exhibition opened on August 2 , called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline combines expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman and landmark dissi@@ dent who had only three days in his office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which could look like someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , was convic@@ ted of 20 charges since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their image was suppressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny black @-@ white bl@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing was visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just returned from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ mel and chew@@ ing gum , producing DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people might look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the time they received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and she couldn &apos;t visit at that time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist and her imprisoned M@@ use became un@@ equal , which over the course of two years exchanged several letters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a cartoon illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President of Chel@@ y@@ Over@@ come would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing released her release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump heads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways that he should actually fix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing concluded with her super@@ large signature underneath ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation &quot; whose basis has been gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ fold of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 characters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully take with is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how sub@@ jec@@ tively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle mentioned above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows Mann@@ ing , as she shows with a free talk in hand from the discipline of the United States like King Kong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they go cold , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist who sends greetings from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do it then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks based on their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ oses were written with pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed themselves with Chelsea , like the movement that was stuck behind their deliver@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western , and an employee of Oxford University for killing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a nationwide human race is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who were looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as the acts of the Cook County Court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several occasions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a common warning system published by the Chicago Police authority , stating that the body was discovered on July 27 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead , and det@@ ective investig@@ ates the Sti@@ cks as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , said civil servants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2007 , La@@ them is professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alan K. cub@@ icle , Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ them had now been judged and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case examined by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokesman for the University and of Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked , wanting to prove that he turned out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building that had just received a mysterious tip which said that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was confirmed by security cameras , that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will finish the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Vice President Vital@@ y Mut@@ co said it won &apos;t last long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the PM commented on the second part of the road@@ map of the WA@@ DA to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the publicly funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got an error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with the Russian outlet r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov made problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing inspections in Russia in November 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a visit to the headquarters of the organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA general director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di no longer sells eggs for the moment
this divided the Group &apos;s groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could not be preceded by any health impairment , it was called in the communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from now on , only eggs must be delivered to Al@@ di , which have demonstr@@ ably been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ine anti @-@ lice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , Al@@ di wants to provide clarity and transparency with his customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start @-@ ups that will help your company , not to become the next U@@ ber &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck at your e @-@ commerce @-@ start @-@ up , but the poll@@ s did not work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people from outside for help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new breed of Human Resources start @-@ ups is growing , to help companies figure out how their employees feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , to offer associates anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to handle the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel , during the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that displays the majority of complaints and which managers have low commitment results - so that you can post why . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you will not be the nearest U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the finance website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has recently been registered as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent businesses can send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a company is found that treats his employees badly or behave eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumers boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Con@@ ver@@ cent has been used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now as the company Con@@ ver@@ cent uses , problems that were previously identified by managers in offices in cities or states have been identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair plac@@ ements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies began to take up ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethnic violations due to the En@@ ron scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry went online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent provide your software as a service , and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire V@@ entures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gl@@ itter@@ ing grab@@ bed $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing his total funding to $ 60 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these investments hardly come unexpectedly , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a growing complex of research , showing that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only wag@@ ering requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated , and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is theirs , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience on Link@@ ed@@ In . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors will achieve yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data on employee engagement , according to experts in the workplace culture , is important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , when a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have a expectation that change is on the way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if the changes are not fast enough , or not at all , this can cause dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are asking for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has left the company too much for collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you do not follow the staff , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem about G@@ LIN@@ T is reported , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , capable of re@@ organizing multiple teams within the company and adding a communication training to address the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector which is known for high sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose customer , then you will lose your company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices , and makes a long day for the Brotherhood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers sit on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have moved out their tri@@ cot , and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a good part of the team , those idle minutes represent a lunch break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return to the Wasser@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real ped@@ alling mill for the guys , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and she has actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the compromise distance of the two days is more than a day when the brood is moved to the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season , during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 from the start of the formal game preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M , September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said he supported the rule of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they added another point to the busy routes of the players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it out , they plac@@ ate further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices when the camp is over , as soon as the clear sight of its fields is stopped by an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already cleared a safety net behind a gate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a cleaned up that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room and then adjust it to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have the video bit of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , I don &apos;t worry too much about that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles to fac@@ tual reviews of third parties and display their results under the original contribution then said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to identify possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors that may display results of the fact check out of the original article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories ahead of the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan to quickly eliminate h@@ asser@@ ted mail@@ ings like before the elections there in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Facebook told in a separate explanation in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts review will be launched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to realizing what stories are challenged by fac@@ tual reviews of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to test its feature on the &quot; related Articles &quot; and works on other changes to his news feed , to reduce wrong messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic book : a castle in the history of England
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a si@@ p hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des and a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Castle in England &quot; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the im@@ print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and letters always smell like smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were also involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who is struck so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ valued &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle like the assembled hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape spot@@ ters , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank a whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received the full access until 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the cler@@ ks began to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years where aristo@@ cr@@ ats said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch in order to have fought the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revolt of 13@@ 81 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il who appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are joined together ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it Pat@@ tern that the family Dar@@ r@@ ell hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ r@@ ell presented his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the G@@ entle@@ men seemed to be quite ga@@ un@@ er , always doing debts and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ r@@ ell @-@ males solved their debt crises , mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se Er@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic @-@ novel about E@@ vil@@ ov , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to get ready with the fu@@ cking life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the cover of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started their campaign on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of August , there should be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ask the makers of action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write them on their website yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in action , it is more than just a logo and a slogan , that is , it continues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive commitment , one that gives the city a unique unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , she is in competition with other municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a mid @-@ five @-@ figure , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost their new umbrella brand and the campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) deliber@@ ates on pensions and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so this week too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first glance , a normal process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting took place no longer in the Building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the pres@@ idency of the government , the five Vice President and Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the deliber@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the civilian population was in the Y@@ AS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the military , the government is dra@@ gging the re@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the officers of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the wi@@ re@@ porter of the coup attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 4@@ 86 people , who allegedly participated directly in the coup attempt , is acting in Ankara for this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan was referred to as the &quot; gift of God &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the paper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ha@@ gen in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are concerns for an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifest in the abolition of the head@@ scar@@ ce ban for female soldiers wrote the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the major rein@@ vention of the army and the security forces continues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan had been firing more 7@@ 3@@ 95 govern@@ ors per Dec@@ ree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three times , they exercised their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the European Union &apos;s reform requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former officers say Erdo@@ gan is driving on , specifically , an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; a particularly not @-@ called officer , who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that is true , NATO could not allow NATO to be cold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , there is doubt in the alliance after cleansing doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weakened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington modi@@ fies rules for the Green Card
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he prefers to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter requirements for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by spending the way citizens from other countries Green Cards will be spent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law will prevent chain migration , and replace the present system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate race track road shuttle
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over and over again , over the past few months , the future of the racing platform has been cont@@ ested - now it is supposed to go very fast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the end of the year , it is supposed to be built on the main road on which the tourist track goes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to secure the future of the motor@@ sport shuttle in the long term , construction work will begin on the route according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ itation the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is committed to this mainly for tourism , &quot; said Transport Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at about 2.5 million euros , the cost of repairs was reduced to about 2.5 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country , is currently fin@@ alised , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Railway as the operator are already in agreement with the technical details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards were negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the Shuttle Shuttle Shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular railway link between the train stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months , in the course of a pilot operation , it has been tested as to whether the route is used by enough people to order them regularly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the track is very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t be cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking their ascension seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modern exp@@ anders have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin , which feels warm - consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs , and select everything from the robot &apos;s eye colour to the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his finger@@ nails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would let a step@@ ford wife appear progres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern exp@@ anders have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as much as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compan@@ ion website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the day , it also has its m@@ oods - like real people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can &quot; be in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships , but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the ad@@ missions to rape , if one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : contradictory ) Far@@ rah . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy has a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their formation and their increasing refin@@ ement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ members their increasing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what is perme@@ ated from the edge of the boundary can be very instruc@@ tive with regard to the spirit of time , in which we live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting , until the free market gives them permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a certain overl@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most deter@@ rent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images that intri@@ cate body and the po@@ ke eyes but how realistic this vision is working .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal behind these sex robots consists in producing a physical simil@@ arity to actual women , as realistic as technically possible ( even with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their gro@@ wers want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cannot separate themselves from their companion , or simply go away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or , to express it in the speech of 2017 : maid Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pumps great performance ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , for the ep@@ it@@ ome of the common sense of human life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a weakness of the tr@@ ump era that the political spl@@ its , which pol@@ arized the US voters , also split families in small @-@ format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of bud@@ ding relatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all re@@ strain all of us supposedly to burst our filter bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less noticed is the power of tr@@ umps , families together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , who visited me this week in New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House anyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which they fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it falls to me in a wider context that this also brings considerable risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ ook@@ y way that we won &apos;t be able to b@@ ump up his k@@ itt@@ ens one day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; that suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of knowledge in comparison to its standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ arious version of crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el of Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are bul@@ ky and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the kli@@ m@@ per@@ ing music im@@ parts this in a strange way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old ; the sky@@ lines become too familiar to offer much excitement and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later and I &apos;m still not over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the themed pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not one - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Central Park @-@ car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , since here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it and have all a great time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I could have been able to evaluate the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before passing my credit card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street , it is the same plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this is to buy something about the counter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not only result in a slow@@ ing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ ously , while I tired of the experience to hand her my credit card with five stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us reloc@@ ated to hospital with chest pain
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , he was taken to hospital because of the treatment of cuts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first dead @-@ seat belt because of murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 by hitting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der , who hid in the cabin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal to the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ el , which they say is too transparent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Authority said that it was claimed by the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us risks that his punishment is increased to 15 years , if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four @-@ door Hand@@ lers from F@@ VO and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and secondary schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of the students will go to college , four to the secondary school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday evening , she welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 29 disciples of the four classes chosen as a symbol of the school release led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle , who is growing up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , the m@@ lower band performed a musical with the title &quot; Der Adler at the chicken farm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chi@@ ckens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the hope of making him a chicken turned , and the eag@@ les spread forth his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , who wore cylinders to make the bet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the eagle stands for integration , said school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will never be like a chicken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his determination is to be free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wished for every four @-@ piece sler , that he felt accepted in his new school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to his colleagues , former school@@ master Michael Müller , who always jumps back to teaching pas@@ sports , and the parents &quot; representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the kitchen @-@ time is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two years of teaching , she left her students only very reluct@@ antly , for it was a really great time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door sler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , all students left a song of summer@@ time and holiday time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the children , great joy broke out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the new school year , eight first @-@ class sler has already registered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two Bulg@@ arians were detained for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs quot@@ ing the television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the morning of August 1 , police arrested a group of illegal refugees , among them the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV , that the Bulg@@ arians were released later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , fin@@ es significant fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls are continued throughout the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry said , that the court can impose a penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
software update for diesel vehicles : what people now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are to improve the emissions behaviour of cars in the emission categories Euro 5 and , in part , Euro 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel , or worse , are excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , the tra@@ ded software updates are voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for vehicles that have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its retro@@ fit has been arranged by the German Federal Aviation Authority ( Bundes@@ amt , KBA ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturers announced a quick implementation in the next few months , but not yet named an exact date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler has announced that it will be available to anyone affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its framework . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long should the conver@@ sions be drawn altogether ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers , as well as from political pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen that the autom@@ akers are not acting on the issue of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the workshop , the conversion itself could last only three to four hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; time @-@ consuming , it could be to get an appointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ACE advises to wait .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably , foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is a massive drop in price of Euro 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ACE advises to wait for a sale .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New York Times said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , that she would use Tr@@ ump to clarify their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we make the city worth living
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ bro Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , is going to rent in R@@ ente next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the place is already written out , but suitable applicants are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a city builder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the work still makes him great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reports on varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , it surprised him that so far no application was fulfilling the requirement profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the earliest time , the city is looking for architects or civil engineers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , under consideration of the regular periods of notice , there is still enough time for a revision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Has@@ lach functions as a sub @-@ legal authority for the Administr@@ ative Community , the applicant must show corresponding conclusions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because this function wants to keep the city , in any case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it would not be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the city and it is important to him , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated to look back on the h@@ ack@@ ers with pride . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction work and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park are approxim@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium refurb@@ ishment is still a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will be able to book about 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a city building master , there is great scope for design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own yard and gardening shop , many things can be handled flexibly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the ol@@ d@@ town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye on what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring city builder emphasizes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears high responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything runs here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor stays long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further shaping of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , you should have a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree or bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of civil engineering and construction planning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipal building department supports civil engineering and civil engineering , construction management planning , residential buildings , municipal yard with building yard and city gar@@ dener , as well as under construction supervisory authorities , including historic monuments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bike thrown on lines : South Railway Line blocked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike on the lines in the area of the Le@@ oben street ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were damaged so severely , that the approaching freight train had to be stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetrators , and have been searching for them since the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the crime scene , witnesses a sco@@ oter and a bike driver were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a coup d &quot; é@@ tat , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetrators or the perpetrators brought themselves into great danger and also end@@ anger the train traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay and the cost of rail replacement , P@@ ossi@@ ers of rail customers may also be charged to the perpetrators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south railway line could be guided without disabilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nearly ten people were cancelled on Friday morning , two of which concerned the correspondence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freight trains did not fall out , but they were late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , approximately 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .

red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300@@ ,000 causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington university that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han assists in developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the intest@@ ine to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food are not penet@@ rated into the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cells that are able to trigger inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it may result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in experiments , it was noted that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han , one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have established a link between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had these immune cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet become more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also enter@@ tains in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had not been separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ biop@@ ic of mice was - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mice of mice were sequ@@ enced and found six types of bacteria found in mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mice were wound up in a sterile environment , so that they did not develop a colon and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. Cru@@ ci@@ i and the immune cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers were able to grow in a fluid and then ski@@ pped small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immune cells developed towards the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of these cells increased by around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that after the mid@@ fiel@@ der played his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 40 million pound of signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid ki@@ cked off on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the blues has been excluded from the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the blues and only took 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve prior to the Premier League season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this week , the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club has done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the airplane manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner , painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pilots flew away from Seattle in Washington State State , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an and attracted several thousand kilometers in the form of a Dream@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the radar screens , the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , Boeing had already made such advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the wind blows : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel still was the SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked after Berlin with a certain concern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only there were no fire in the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the federal government - that was the most important wish of the election warri@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , that has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the staff from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are observing the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , wouldn &apos;t be described with head@@ winds in the approach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were failures .
and one by one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fraction of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five months before the State Parliament election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green @-@ Federal Managing Director , Michael Kell@@ ner , asked El@@ ke T@@ ests to return her mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear distortion of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ ester must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and campaign director of the Green Party of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should not be true . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ ner si@@ ghs when the new ob@@ scene message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , the former SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U in the absence of his own government majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD national associations .
and nobody knows what happens next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March , the misery began . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a blue eye , no more , the comrades re@@ ass@@ ented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was done , and everything became much worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the w@@ ob@@ ble , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te hau@@ led the party smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comrades , in the weeks thereafter , resum@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with him came the next grav@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD chief of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and because in crisis communications , he did everything wrong after that , which can be done wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , Schol@@ z is fighting for his political survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the VW exhaust @-@ gas composition and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of that , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the league in recent weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endeav@@ our of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , too , did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz &apos;s surroundings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they left him , because they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabilization of the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the exact opposite could occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l finds no guilt on the internal party Zw@@ ist in Lower Saxony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Schulz does not know at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the time being , the comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their anger is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the stub@@ born parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ anism of the T@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is intol@@ erable and democratic as Mrs. T@@ ester represents their own career star@@ ters on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the Editorial Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. T@@ ester is not elected as a direct candidate , but has been elected to parliament on the national list of the Lower Saxony Green Party , thus further down the Saxon de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins of a &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vote four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Saxon SPD as the leading candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for the explanation of the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to know if there has been more , or there has been further commitments from the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
funding for town centre III
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to be in the years old house , can soon receive support from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg City Development were informed on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler held a review of what was happening until now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1991 , there are in sentim@@ ents remedi@@ ation areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is important to promote interior design , not only to open up new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on April 4 , the Chair of Karlsruhe announced the information that there will be a re@@ development area III . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funding sum amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 euros come from the country , the rest of the commun@@ e of sensations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how is a restructuring area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is necessary to further investigate Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it plays a role , however , whether there is an interest in the planned area at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , the regional borders may be postpon@@ ed again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state program &quot; Social City , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; core of the program are the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving residential and working conditions , maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is per plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the rehabilitation area would finally be set as a set @-@ up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of January 1 , 2017 , the approval period for the funding period continues until 30 April 20@@ 26 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , until September this year , however , the stock@@ taking will only be carried out , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November or December , the deadline for the statute is to take place in order for the renov@@ ations to be started next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that every commun@@ e must carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to evaluate the urban development of the city , and to decide when it will be renovated and to what extent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the respective land , there will also be a note in the land register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again for sensations and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel emphasized that the project is a key success factor for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and to be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and land arc &quot; which , among other things , is the structural condition and the refurb@@ ishment views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; Bud@@ get@@ ary and H@@ ousing Estate , &quot; information about the size , layout and residents of a residential room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be filled only when operating in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it must be noted that Got@@ zel indicated that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who comes first , grin@@ ds first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could not reserve funds for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the project , photos of the project &quot; Location II &quot; were shown to make the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor sets itself a micro@@ chip in order to get into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am ( 33 ) im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedures are carried out according to medical standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip , and lasts only 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company of Mr Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the married father of one has now built in both home and BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House decision to fly a naval helicopter to South La@@ wn for an event that canc@@ els American production last month , cost tax@@ pa@@ yers left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green @-@ White S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a truck made from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the helicopter was exhibited in Connec@@ ti@@ cut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn according to the Nav@@ al Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the deputy commander of the Aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the note adds that if the departure from the white house should be delayed , a second crew would need a second flight back on account of the limitation of the service hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original flight crew was during the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the recordings made available to the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked , if the event could harm the destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; the deputy commander answered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and was not covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform of the reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to con@@ serve government regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , their use only for a photo operation is unusual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential jet was in front of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential plane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 countries that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Assistant Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often run training flights in the Washington area and South La@@ wn to sus@@ pending US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event included the training requirements of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesman of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in expos@@ ing the helicopter to the South La@@ wn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budgets for the pres@@ idency flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Department of Defense for 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records of Un@@ ity record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the Nav@@ al Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co , Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers on the basis of estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wal@@ ters said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take account of the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the former press spokesperson of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things this week , produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to emphasize this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire bri@@ g@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of buck@@ ling job
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the top of the second tennis league , S@@ V joins the second tennis league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss lives in Kiel tomorrow at 11 : 00 a.m. in Kiel , Germany , with the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the second tennis league has gained the sense of reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially on the back positions , I find the team very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high North are mainly concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Danish and Finn@@ s can even point to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; Z@@ ay says with view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is becoming difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high North is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will be playing the first in this season at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , the Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was still on the ball with the white @-@ rus@@ hing An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his two victories , last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again move into the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , does not fill up the cad@@ re from the coach station around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really happy did Donald Tr@@ ump , when he put his signature under the law to sharpen@@ ing sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress adopted a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reaction from Moscow , too , was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels har@@ assed the US offensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the plan envis@@ ages to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , investors from domestic O@@ MV , which together with other European companies have joined the construction of the Russian Eastern Partnership North Stream 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the threat of dr@@ ink@@ age is enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it is too early to estimate the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would even have to raise the sanctions by executive order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at which the group could ward off and which could hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is moved to the center in the Hit@@ ti@@ x series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer , Net@@ fli@@ x &apos;s series is far from gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the season three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the newest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ it@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el ; Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ it@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is their head and P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) is in charge of Mexican connection and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns to Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support the war against drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st , 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; roll back : the town presents 46 kitchen aid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city organizes the K@@ ita lunch table again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with firm contact persons for the children , and assignment to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the city centers , the clock is turned back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of September 1 , Kre@@ feld is taking over food supplies in the city &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant director in the department of youth welfare , this is good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it continues to cook except house , a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked ch@@ illed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Kre@@ feld area , the city operates 46 child@@ care centers , in 44 children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , 2@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children , who are served 45 hours of the week , eat lunch at K@@ ita , &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care if children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 part @-@ time forces from 1st September kitchen service : they warm up the delivered food , supplement them to salad , raw food and fruit , portions the meal individually , clean the food , clean and clean the kitchen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a c@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the size - there are two groups , as well as seven @-@ scale units - decides on the circum@@ ference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assistants are now firm to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team , be useful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the children too , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the children , this continuity is important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen forces - is to be done by a special cleaning staff in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm that it has proven itself in the cost comparison between self @-@ regulation and foreign trade for the city as the most economical , it is said of the press office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 people in the training area , &quot; Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , Director of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will be candidates in the provinces . three women are appointed for the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 per cent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully participating and involved in all parts of the election process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections take place on April 5 , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban have published threats against a election process , which coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be handed over peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Afghan independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3,@@ 6 million voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hike to the TV @-@ jubil@@ ee
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the occasion of the 110 @-@ year @-@ old existence , the TV Kaiser@@ ingen invites you to a small hike with subsequent coffee and cake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hike will start on Sunday , 9 July at 13 : 00 in Froh@@ n@@ st@@ etten , near the reservoir of water reservoir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from there it goes to the air@@ field , to the Nat@@ ter and over the Wald@@ hof back to the reservoir of water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hike lasts approximately one and a half hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that there will be coffee , cake , cool drinks , str@@ ing@@ ed saus@@ ages and cheese in the school house in Kaiser@@ ingen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need a history of Kaiser@@ ingen for Froh@@ n@@ st@@ etten , the meeting point will be at the school in Kaiser@@ ingen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
men trying to expose 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men at the age of 19 and 23 should have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 5@@ pm , because they wanted to phone the girl with the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused , but went on with her friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the cell phone and the necklace of the girl , which however failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without prey , the duo fled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations are running .
G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie , a union wants to ensure the long @-@ term commitment to production in its Glasgow plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said , the company kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which is manufactured in addition to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich tea bis@@ cuits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experienced first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s representative , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s willingness to express &quot; concerns about the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior organizer , Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerned by our members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus greatly on the local community and the large @-@ scale Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production down@@ turn , the eastern end of Glasgow is desper@@ ately needed at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this since we appreciate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uns@@ af@@ e business climate , we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to stay competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production . if our operations are changing at the site , employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three years ago , the PS@@ G Barcelona warned against N@@ ey@@ mar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side of La League may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main did not abandon N@@ ey@@ mar after giving away an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million in order to release its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and for the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source close to the Catal@@ ans board is that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , three years ago , the football world was warned of the PS@@ G president before this prospect ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any association wanting to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ ai@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign a one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti in the beginning of this summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator has deliberately thrown out a sco@@ oter in the royal court street in front of the property number 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , telephone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for clu@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police are looking for witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he was driving a car in his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to ev@@ ade and tou@@ red the console . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 year old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um came to Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the location of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane so he had to do@@ dge to the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the console . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
material damage was caused by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the accident , it can be good that the accident driver had not noticed the accident at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police now request witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the causing vehicle to contact the com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au under Tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report relieved Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases relieved Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use scandal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ensures more discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ es , spokesman of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication from the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the former Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then wrong assessment of the processes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in reporting on violence in the Dom@@ jets with &quot; two measures &quot; is measured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the gri@@ ps in Regensburg no one doub@@ ted that it would have to be &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and Ta@@ xis said in the interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you like to go to the church and it &apos;s a little fres@@ her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; put@@ ts were a very normal educational tool , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with nau@@ ghty children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with the reports of mis@@ use cases , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with En@@ ligh@@ tenment Ulrich Weber ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regensburg Cathedral spar@@ rows were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and early 1990s , with a high degree of plau@@ sibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by many cases Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was employed in many cases physical and psychological violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , punishment for the students could be more severe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories are connected with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report was relieved of the mis@@ use scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the incidents of victims of violence in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; firstly , many students raise their &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , he also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who has become hand@@ some of the wine when a cathedral record has no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as its bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : when you get the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is common at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just eight pages are dedicated to him , and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside its sphere of influence , the violence processes at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also took place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible to throw him at best , to experience it too late , or to have taken first hints seriously enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um where he worked was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s wide majority of his pupils , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , also portra@@ y him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who provided the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and &quot; always surrounded by children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to flood breaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this , not only with chairs , but also pinn@@ ed ear cow@@ ards and too che@@ ek@@ y boys to the hair or ears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question of time , the 1960s and 1970s , with both parents and teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to what it is actually about in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and violence in the primary school , they are certainly dre@@ d@@ ging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one wonders whether it is not rather with its popularity and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just collap@@ sed on him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Bavarian Pope , many people who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth , however , is : the report rati@@ fies Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with the report , much about the topic of mis@@ use in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was reported in the media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is also accused of any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clear no .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted himself to the Cathedral Master . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk with my father or mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they didn &apos;t even know parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a conductor who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ator professionally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do I rate the R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student interpreted it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he would have had timely insights and could have stopped the respective off@@ ender .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is imp@@ uted to him ... Bu@@ bs more in@@ sist@@ or or more clearly or more , than against their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to talk to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; it was impossible to confirm that affected students and / or their environment were familiar with him in advance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak of any compassion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of having prevented or brought him to the display . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there is no reason to link his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately occurred in some cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister , is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; See &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in the coverage of everything mixed and mixed into a huge range of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is precisely the mis@@ use of the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , between the primary school and the secondary school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , let &apos;s say other repro@@ aches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from the period since 1945 , so also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir director of the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the horrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were really slan@@ der@@ ated and disgu@@ ised , were en@@ chan@@ ted at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do because he only got to face the boys when they were already at the Cathedral gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on that , as most witnesses stress , the subject of &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; is t@@ abo@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you were just happy to be able to escape , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different in the gym@@ nasi@@ um gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but not a sa@@ di@@ stic force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , may even associate positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most , the accus@@ ation remains to be taken away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just started to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he did not want to hear anything , and then back in 1993 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the states , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently van@@ ished the ears ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral gym@@ nasi@@ um , which the report actually reproduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this , he points out that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , he will continue to practice the punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as a test penalty was banned in Bavaria long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , they acquired a legal grey area , as each one of us probably knows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was also difficult for him to estimate where the suffer@@ ers might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit had been crossed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but one cannot say , he had always looked away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s just not true .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in 1980 , the test penalty for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and Ta@@ xis said yes , it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger of judging the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the princess was right , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ rent at all times and also not for what was broken in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s pra@@ w@@ ns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s all terrible , and I &apos;m glad that it will finally work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at the same time , I must take shelter Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , thus tear@@ ing and drawing on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as physical punishment , then it was strictly forbidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is the picture of his burger , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of testing also apply to language ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI said from his perspective that the Dom@@ jets played only a minor role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , I do not by no means conce@@ al that he led a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world @-@ tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with bis@@ cuits and sweets alone , one does not play a big vo@@ cal@@ ist and every success , just in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what kind of people did you experience when talking to their book , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : by working on the book and beyond that , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deep @-@ believing and heart @-@ good people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regularly get in touch with how many former Dom@@ jets still keep contact with him today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ ding , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was stern to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , most of the Dom@@ jets are grateful to him that he has enriched her life and brought to them the world of music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he is always a good , father@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect for respect to which they still look up and worship them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and please , once again clear : all that you have presented to him are educational methods that were on the agenda back then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can be glad , that we have long over@@ came this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is highly unfair , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the report , which has just been published , is relieved of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the status quo , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows , finally in peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
