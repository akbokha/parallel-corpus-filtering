28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went up again with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cor@@ pse , found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 year old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided into San Francisco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder , and the investigation was running . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , got his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will really miss him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this difficult time , our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia gave that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone , who would want to harm his younger brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was a friendly man with a great heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; connecting his family to his family was to always cook something to prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the brother , who swa@@ m with the river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that sh@@ one every day bri@@ ghtly , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone who has the information in the event will be asked to call the sign on the SF@@ PD , under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston hasn &apos;t always to be perfect or successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hollywood star has now made it clear in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be put in drawers or glued from outside the label that has little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather schn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is regarded as &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as explained in the &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the time the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of a television with a relaxed de@@ bris and Mexican food , it is in the magazine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they bring the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film will be running on August 25 , 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the Py@@ ramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little change with some colleagues with a ride on the beach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sport Py@@ ramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holidays , they hun@@ ted for the feeding comfort in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with that , the riding career ended up already . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer ever was - 101 tournament wins - again close to horses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could lead himself to the AL@@ RV , with his family , on a horse not even for photographic purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and there@@ with also at CH@@ IO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of a small gala , the German Spor@@ ts@@ hip donated the Golden Sport Py@@ ramid to the man from An@@ hausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for awards , it does not lack the symp@@ athetic athlete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , silver Lor@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour player of the year ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the Queen Queen has already loaded it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a long time , the 18th winner of the Sport Py@@ ramid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans GÃ¼nter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros right away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was included in the Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the leader Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ field Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ Ã¶h@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company wander@@ ed into the ski@@ pping stadium , where the Lav@@ azza price went . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tr@@ umps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade agreement , is both Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are un@@ ambig@@ uous in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosophical difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the state , the role of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death , he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claims Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will drive back regulations heavily , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , he has advant@@ aged opportunities to open and needs money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore taxes for the rich would be increased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the need to invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost wor@@ dless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic candidate announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies , and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ap@@ ro wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , on Tr@@ ump , even party @-@ internal discussions could come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more clearly , the differences in energy and climate policy are significant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive coal mining in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , and he wants to announce the Paris climate protection agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , plans to extend the renewable energies with its investment programme and demands : &quot; a country will be the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want we to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not only with infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ PP , the trade agreement that is tran@@ spa@@ ent , both do not want to sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the US does not want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade , but simply better protect American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be paid even better , calls for Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what tr@@ ump is about to do is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage must be r@@ asp@@ ed , then he says he may not be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump stands , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his critics argue that the budget deficit would only be bigger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fled woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing on their own , almost everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a house offers refuge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a large kitchen , four women are sitting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each one has a baby , which is at the most one year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one has put her little son in his arm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with big eyes , he looks curi@@ ously into the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his mother sits on the table top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she s@@ miles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is the business director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the north of Munich , they live in one of the few de@@ centralised accommodations for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs collabor@@ ated with Pro Famili@@ a and the Frau@@ enk@@ irche in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men do not exist , nor as visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ation to say that every woman who arrives here has been experiencing experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are pursued politically , because they threatened torture or death , or because their families send them as hope carriers to Europe , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in women , there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; many secretly steal from it because they do not see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ ours , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what drives them away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ gs require a sexual act for example for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believes that , as soon as they arrived in Germany , B@@ ahr talks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and badly ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women who live in the apartment in the North of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , appreci@@ ating them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children were certainly not voluntarily created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many women are used to it , that they say nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience because shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they often don &apos;t know how to help , it needs more accommodations only for them , calls B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , the seven district regi@@ ments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich , they answered no . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , for example , there is no such thing in homes of governments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fle@@ eting women are not housed separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committee calls for women to be housed separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or will men and women hold together can lead to - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the wash@@ rooms should be separate and easily accessible to women , stands in the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much women feel this need for protection , one can read at the rush that exists in the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily open a second house .
chief physicians argue : demands for new work combat measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of the assistance doctors called on their union to approve new work combat measures in their disputes concerning a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council , to approve more work campaign measures from the beginning of September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC told , that ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns of the Treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July , assistance physicians and medical students voted for the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was rejected by 58 % of his members , who voted in the elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members released on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently continued to have problems , was that the contract was rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and request official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today filed a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to approve a running program of escal@@ ating activities that began at the beginning of September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disputes led to the fact that Assistance doctors struck six times this year , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the BM@@ A assistance physician Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors and medical students , that the contract was advantageous and should be accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the vote , the health minister Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the agreement for doctors in England would be introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves their hands , and to proclaim an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when Vladimir Putin welcomes his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot forbi@@ d the impression that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Putin &apos;s s@@ miles seemed narrow@@ ly and he radi@@ ated hardly any heat , even for his reluct@@ ant circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan repeatedly spoke of his dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next day , a newspaper compla@@ ined that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was horri@@ fied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin shared and accused Ankara , to please Russia in his back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was even greater , since it was done by a supposed friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to rebuild the ve@@ to becomes difficult , if not even impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media conducted a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at one time , it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most serious were alle@@ gations of leading officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had prof@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he denied this ehem@@ ently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , this meeting was held only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan who he wanted to hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Erdo@@ gan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he had been relieved of his ministry during the last month , when a coup d &apos;@@ Ã©@@ tat failed last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be relieved once the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they count on a late @-@ seasonal attack on the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this week , the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demographic sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ankara is angry at the West , as its response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power was regarded as a weak answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment on the s@@ nail &apos;s pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ qu@@ ed point is to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state gained a bonus on the fact that after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ Ã©@@ tat he called for support for the elected state organs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a deep fear of regime change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders , &quot; as an analy@@ st once said to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support contradictory pages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents express themselves at the press conference that they had not even stri@@ pped the subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of Turkey deliberately decided to answer a question about their differences , whereas Putin decided to emphasize it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey dropped off the Russian fighter jet , it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Executive Committee of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back @-@ office role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with the fact that the R@@ BS brand shares with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end @-@ consumer finance brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she supported international sports with millions pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now , it has decided to focus more on national brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , de@@ centralized Head@@ quarters and Stock Exchange to Nat@@ West will change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are other smaller brands for retail , which are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a sightseeing tour , Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed by customers and cow@@ or@@ kers in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand and the brand among which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but pursue local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities , and our employees will work with the customers among these brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer carry out its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship , and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in his sports sponsor@@ ship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of brands , for how do we concentrate within ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Pre@@ dile@@ ction Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori gains its 3,@@ 000@@ th profit at New@@ market &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys Ch@@ ampagne after a double in New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th gain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British prize at New@@ market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he put a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , who reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very emotional , because my family is here too &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very happy that it has happened in New@@ market , because I landed here 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am relieved and very humble .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er , when he picks up his victory at Pre@@ dile@@ ction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle @-@ race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ m@@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who achieved more than 4.@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career centers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m , and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , reaching only a few before him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect , which differs from the others in the weight control room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma thrilled fans for years for this kind of sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already collected 6,000 wins if he was not just a weekend and great tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the UK , Frank@@ ie has already cut almost 30 years of winners , which is great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat track for two decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven , &quot; in As@@ cot , but he also survived a crash and was banned from drug prohibition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three years ago , he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his two @-@ flute and to return to its top form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he is not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue in competitions , until at least 5@@ 0.@@ - years of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Putin po@@ ur@@ izes Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin , unexpectedly , dismissed his chief of staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s narrow@@ est confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , it says that without giving reasons , Putin has ordered his duties as president of the Russian presidential system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was a deputy in Ivan@@ ovo since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born 1972 in Tall@@ inn &apos;s est@@ onian capital , he graduated at the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it is ( in Russian ) that he later was the chief of the staff and chief of staff of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding legislation and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday , that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o recommended his successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
are the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confi@@ ded Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a meeting with President Putin that was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff came back on his own request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but despite ridi@@ culous for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , is the result of a kind of power struggle ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody knows this at this moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the official claim - that a man , who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , would once again lead the Russian environmental policy - arous@@ ed great scep@@ ticism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his remarks to Putin , cited on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential management for four years and eight months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a member of the Russian Security Council , and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Putin reached power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term of office , Ivan@@ ov might be president of Russia as a third term in the term would have viol@@ ated the Constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this post was taken by another attacking allies of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin became Prime Minister , before he became president three and a half years later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
criminal min@@ ds star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced their dis@@ miss@@ al in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the set , it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; details of how Gib@@ son &apos;s character is written out of the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old , who previously played at the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; Gib@@ son said in a message published Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned radi@@ ance of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for 28 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ri@@ dd@@ les around fish , landing in Ban@@ ff garden &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resident of Ban@@ ff asked for help in identifying the fish , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could deal with sandals , which were mirr@@ ored by a fountain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ port Crossing : bridge , now connected with Fi@@ fe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project is to be completed by May 2017 , the Â£ 1.@@ 35 billion project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; engineers have connected the North deck of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt , meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deck blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 hel@@ ical ropes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project is to be completed by May 2017 , the Â£ 1.@@ 35 billion project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister Keith Brown completed a visit to the building site , and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ port cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , almost 79 % of the entire deck decks are at their place and the last section of the deck is getting a ju@@ g@@ gling for the deck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this fantastic project , the closure is state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art high @-@ rise and civil engineering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the installation of the last block of road and its connection with the existing north tower deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or the north side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge , 700 milli@@ meters south . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a massive and at the same time , very delicate activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; massive because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of approx . 3 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the toler@@ ances , on which the team worked , were tiny - on each side , they only bet@@ tered a few milli@@ meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rescue at the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lucky still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; luck to be alive , &quot; after they were thrown off a fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station was on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men had difficulties to swim , while their boat moved forward from their own strength . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set off the worst , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach until we left water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a boat without a life@@ jacket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they all came aboard the coastal rescue boot , and were brought back to the rescue station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water were lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controlled the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , someone has w@@ aking up over these men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
badly injured - man is stab@@ bed to his ex @-@ girlfriend
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife , and severely injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to get his personal stuff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the alcoholic offen@@ ders cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she entered the apartment , he stab@@ bed it twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand , and the body was injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police could arrest the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothing , he called his mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this al@@ armed , then , responded to his sister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with their partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down their brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , she could not move him to leave the apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , she went out of the house with her partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the road , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who builds the housing of Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Invest@@ ors should be much stronger in future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig , over the next few years , will lose almost 1300 affordable apartments ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first and foremost , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build urban areas will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cheap apartments can , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the main focus in the city hall is , as Brat@@ mann said , &quot; How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as 20 percent of apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing fund that will cost millions of dollars and will still be financed must provide incentives for incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few prescri@@ p@@ tions as possible .
the left wants to impose tough@@ er conditions for investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter how viol@@ ently , grav@@ mann , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the concept of action is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the construction management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how does one balance the loss of more than 1300 affordable housing , whose funding will be extended over the next few years ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to prevent this , Nicole Palm &apos;s budget@@ ary spokesperson should now be purchased from the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to price binding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is possible in West@@ stadt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because in the West@@ stadt , deadlines are coming up at the end of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 1800 apartments , one could bring back to the price binding for cheap apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing corporations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased , and the aim of so @-@ called mixing is to be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there should be no longer a concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will still be movement in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice @-@ president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; though , I concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what does not mean , that there cannot be a compromise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teen@@ age and child don &apos;t go outside for playing , but rather prefer to spend their free time playing on screens , was lam@@ ented over the last decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Pok@@ em@@ on Go , it &apos;s about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later they created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many pop culture phenomena , interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand dropped somewhat in early July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand , which over@@ took the server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within a few days , Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ Ã©@@ mons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 3@@ 5.000 users recently announced that within two days of the game market launch , the number of following people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company does not know who plays Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon go , only the raw data for the performance increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take 30 minutes to get &quot; off the sofa , &quot; and &quot; to be active every day . &quot; they stum@@ ble on deaf ears because many public messages for health are boring and coming from people who look miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who are doing sports regularly , reduces the chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the miracle of Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine plus fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people hunt new friend@@ ships , even in hunting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always , there are also murder@@ ous toys , which always have to complain about something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what should it do ?
a breakthrough has occurred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit earlier could track our activity , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new will lose its appeal , and the use will fade with time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and help lots of people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and now finally , Olympic Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast rang out for the competition title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her overall score of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American female Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ net@@ h on the lum@@ bar during the individual multi @-@ campaign of women in the gym@@ n@@ ast in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman , who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation , the best of her generation or even at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she burst into tears when her final result was shown , and her long journey at that moment was an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this success makes them the same league as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world champion Med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she expected her last examination in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered disappointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after they won gold and silver in individual multi @-@ campaign women during the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of the team co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Bil@@ ly insisted on having never planned the future , it is not really true . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
part of their soil exercises which contain their typical tum@@ bling pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans during a school discharge into the gym@@ nasi@@ um , was put into force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competition , a winning series that will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though Mu@@ staf@@ ina was slightly led by two turns , the picture was blur@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which Bil@@ es holds the title of the world title , it was loud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she rose again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the lum@@ bar @-@ beam again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground another one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her sof@@ tly when she expected her grand@@ son - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flo@@ cked on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of men , named by the Americans , had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after their ground exercise , she threw the audience to the audience , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback that sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as Bil@@ es are concerned , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the start of this week : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police : 3 victims in serial kill@@ ings shot in the car , shot in the car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl killed in one of Phoenix &apos;s dead@@ liest attacks while listening to the car and listening to music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ an@@ ie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , said the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car , and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is read in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that the triple murder does not have been the result of a rob@@ bery , as the Att@@ acker didn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police spokesperson of Phoenix S@@ gt@@ . Jonathan Howard said , that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic residential areas within four months and two more injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; commented Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked , and committed by the same killer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which dropped on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and assumed that it was the production of the serial killer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investig@@ ators found sponsor@@ ing sleeves and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but like the fe@@ west of his old friend Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t manage that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wher@@ eu@@ pon , I have not left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s wrong at all -- of course , one has embark@@ ed on it , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband , Vincent and her , was told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to this was &quot; I did not know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year , and he can still not speak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he slowly progres@@ ses .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language , which Ed@@ mund is asking for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him drawing language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as for Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus during pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to is reminiscent of the emotional price of an uncertain future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly asked , what will happen ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what will happen ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and she still doesn &apos;t know , yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t asked for guidance for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a promising advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus .
it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you know , that it will be better for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; severe rain@@ falls , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue missions in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavy ra@@ ins and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on Friday the state of emergency , and it will be expected throughout Saturday with more rain@@ falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; numerous rivers in southeast Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is flooded their shores and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme rain@@ falls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities , and are already on the road to the affected communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the governor , shared that the inquiries for flood @-@ water , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ste@@ ele said , that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested tens of thousands of sand bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weather service announced that in this area , additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it was ra@@ ining in the Mobile field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rescue teams are still involved in flood water in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts , in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by Glo@@ ver on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that Be@@ aver Creek water , which is normally located more than 400 feet away from his house , greatly increased overnight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that another step@@ son , who lives near , would have warned him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford that she lived in the 48 years , where she lived there , never seen such a high level of river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities , and he would be the only one who can swim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ be , where they were accommodated till Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread rapidly , as there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer contacted Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was completely su@@ cked by the rain@@ falls since Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities indicated that heavy rain@@ falls and floo@@ ding floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , Par@@ ish and L@@ oss in five school districts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WW@@ L , the C@@ BS , reported that there were 200 flooded houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which were now both flooded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of Rob@@ by Miller , said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven domestic animals , washed by floods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emer@@ gen@@ cies were set up to accommodate the ev@@ acu@@ ees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and sand bags were provided for the residents to take along . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported as flooded , but on Friday no reported incidents were reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at shop@@ per value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; T@@ own@@ son said , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pun@@ ched from bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police reported that the 6 year old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a six @-@ year @-@ old child was shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several gun@@ shots , including in the l@@ ende , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was at the hospital during his transport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pun@@ ched by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ de@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I simply cannot believe this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital , and he had to undergo several operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boy &apos;s family shared the transmitter , that it is expected to recover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown was one of four people , who were shot in German@@ town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition , the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who was found in a critical condition , reported the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other two victims were not in the car , and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could find the perpetrators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an investig@@ ator , C@@ BS Philadelphia shares that it seems to have come to a cross @-@ fire between several arch@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , exceeded the crime scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems , that this was a definite struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were shells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it seems to have given here several armed fighters who were actively involved , &quot; divided police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no arrest , and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , another 6 year old girl was hit by a qu@@ ag@@ ger on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ covers , and the police are still searching for a suspect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why we need Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Cup in the Tur@@ ns , and for more than one reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , I have been with every summer olymp@@ i@@ ade since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and secondly : this team has three towers , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired many young girls of other skin colour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the ca@@ tho@@ lic is round off , makes everyone proud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , this team is a reflection of the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has soli@@ di@@ fied black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last four years , the number one among the female gym@@ na@@ sts was an African @-@ American woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas enjoyed a surprising Olympic champion and America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the thre@@ ef@@ old world champi@@ onships in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected , yet master@@ ful Gy@@ mas@@ tics routines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual competition event for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we experience the top of this sport , but this does not look like gym classes throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have four towers in the team . besides , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily comes up in private sports clubs which are maintained by parents responsible for training , training , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gym@@ n@@ astic and families ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the majority of these trainers are located in prosper@@ ous suburbs which can support the business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these societies , the Tur@@ ner gets its entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started with the gymnas@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to inspire the churches of countless , young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easy accessible gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I founded my Turn@@ halle of 20 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at my events we have offered free and affordable gymnas@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban adolescents ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September we will go to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this combination offers life @-@ long benefits to health , as well as for school and professional success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team gol@@ ds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
assistance physicians want to organise more strikes after being rejected by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministers had hoped to finish the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance doctors who voted for a vote rejected him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July , Hun@@ t had unveiled its plans to forci@@ bly introduce the contract , and said that the N@@ HS was found in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first assistance doctors shall receive a new contract , containing changes to bed@@ time and weekly calendar items to improve the maintenance of late times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assi@@ stenz@@ sts announced last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance physicians have left serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat the current occupation crisis and line it up to treat all doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes caused by discussions hit the government for ad@@ versaries and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was done by a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t for the last month , that his door would always be open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to raise the penetration and address the concerns of the assistance physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he does not do this , the doctors have made it clear that they are ready to perform additional work combat measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates , as nur@@ ses and physicians were included to cover doctors on the strike chain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ministers had hoped to termin@@ ate the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ A wants a better weekend pay for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , asked the assistant doctors to stop the strike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work combat measures achieve nothing but little , but already burden un@@ loaded teams and service providers and only provide concern , emergency and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last two months , we spoke to the committee of the assistance doctors and responded positively to the health ministry and other mini@@ stries with regard to concerns regarding tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employers hoped that continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as des@@ patch , flexibility in training , training opportunities and gender @-@ specific wage gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was to employers , health education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Â£ 2 per day , which can reduce heart attack risks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a Â£ 2 @-@ per day medication , after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drug is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ HS regul@@ ators have recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regul@@ ators have recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material into the ar@@ tery walls , forming layers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged up to the heart and caused a heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through blood stream and clo@@ g blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persons who already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk of having another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots unlikely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the introduc@@ tory design of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month taking of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack may have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who had already had a heart attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture makes electoral fraud flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ let Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office because of corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud was unknow@@ ingly ignored in Muslim communities , such as a devastating government report today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric Pick@@ les , former cabinet member , acc@@ uses the police , election observers and Rath@@ geber to ignore proof of electoral abuse on the basis of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violations of eth@@ no and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former minister of integration and municipal government , who now is a secret king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motifs would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of electoral cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should prove their identity in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , a vot@@ er must name only its name and address . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person &apos;s finger , if they give up their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that comes with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report was arranged by D@@ ow@@ ning Street , as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , a special election court decided that the current mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be relieved after a lit@@ any to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way and that he had put his critics in silence with rac@@ ist and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign is based on the fact that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 300 votes were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , in which one person chooses someone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said that in the whole country , there was evidence of fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , he expressed himself alar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence - among the older members of the Muslim community pres@@ sured to elect a candidate for their choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guiding of ways to prove identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evidence was given that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was chosen , especially women and young people in order to choose in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or Banglad@@ es@@ hi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... State institutions have unknow@@ ingly ignored such conduct on the basis of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric mentioned 50 recommendations in order to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists work correspondence documents to stop their election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires harder registration checks to prevent the election directory being used for immigration and welfare purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consider options to ask voters before the election , after your identification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not use removable ink on the finger of a person , as soon as she gave up her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible for election .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications for an automatic correspondence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban , that political activists deal with full brief@@ ings and envel@@ opes of letters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the authority to set up barriers for elec@@ tive stations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change of law that facilitates an accus@@ ation of in@@ timi@@ dation according to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Leg@@ isl@@ ative Law 1983 ) .
ban on photography in election stations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; requirement , that only English may be used in the electoral stations ( except Wales ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees rule out that voters go alone in the election cab . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case no criminal complaint has been placed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitutional Court has declared Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any to corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty of a number of reasons - according to the high demands of the criminal proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; ti@@ cking checks &quot; of the City H@@ alls &apos;s election registration departments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Supreme Court in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country has a proud legacy as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler double @-@ decker and other famous Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the Olympic Games 2016 in Rio are now over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Fer@@ rand @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T out of the edge and band that has proven to be an impressive double @-@ vo@@ gue of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only one to have gold fighting athlete , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created lists of Olympic Games that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in bow shooting Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides K@@ ates double @-@ ge@@ ant on the cycling track , many people pointed out on the internet , like a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi , Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the team member of the US team in bow shooting Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after images , on which he looks suspi@@ ciously similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got ins@@ anity into the social media and admitted that he has been hearing from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t see any resem@@ b@@ lance , except facial hair , &quot; shared Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I take this as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the all@@ uring simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina , with her big , expressive eyes , is to be able to go through as a double singer for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African Schwi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a gear higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the Inc@@ eption actor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian silver med@@ al@@ lion in Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord was att@@ ested to an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face and eyes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the only ones : a Twitter User was very happy about the fact , that others also noticed the simil@@ arities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; theory is put into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the US soccer star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile that is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas that has her own beautiful and wide smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
C@@ BC @-@ comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese float has died as a pig .
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis over the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m free @-@ sty@@ ling squ@@ ad@@ rons of the C@@ BC live transmission of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Canadian television station C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze , after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; like M@@ ief took off &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off , when he placed his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200 free @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ rons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mac@@ don@@ ald , who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS comment@@ ator team to give more &quot; color , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the union , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too excited , retired as low , died like a pig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks for that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese Schwi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , swa@@ m the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to shut the gap to China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spectators across Canada were quickly re@@ acting online , after they were shocked by the sound and language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ eted , &quot; Does the C@@ BC comment@@ ator have just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot didn &apos;t get that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m long sty@@ ling squ@@ ad@@ ron for women : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost its connection to baby . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the criticism of By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which many people spoke to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter User did not stay back when they heard , how uncomfortable By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you represent the C@@ BC and Canada , and makes us look like ra@@ cists . # added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ don@@ ald , said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment about a swimming performance was broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times with the people who responded to the news on Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ don@@ ald
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users , who compla@@ ined about Mac@@ don@@ ald &apos;s comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed , too , and issued a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made , and that it was made possible for them to be eman@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our audience in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make one clear , By@@ ron &apos;s comments relates to the performance of the float and not on it as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , they were inappropriate and an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald exc@@ used in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I applied myself to the performance of the float and not to it as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no failure was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about women , who tried sham@@ elessly under@@ wear in the shop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buyers did not know where to look , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a mar@@ row to try for@@ h@@ osen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked as she looked at it and put her back into the shelf again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Pri@@ mark store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear she went out and left the shop without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own bush trousers and trousers and tried them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat discreet location to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she repeated the same thing with three further under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like that and went out again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone , or think about the person who might buy the under@@ pants they had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to think that someone would take shelter from home that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident took place on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the staff tried to withdraw clothing from the sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and went out and didn &apos;t wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all products , which are coming into question , were withdrawn from the sale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to protect yourself against weapon attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or back , this video will show you how to flip the sk@@ ew@@ er for your smo@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you get behind you from behind , then you should turn around first , so you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the shot , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then take the gun between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder , before hitting it with your free el@@ bow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then hit it with your knees in the bar and twist , while the att@@ acker attacks pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the running into the face and move backwards while they turn the weapon on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the Att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip until they move backwards and align the weapon to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how to make Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but remember that in a rob@@ bery , the saf@@ est thing is to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before leaving each object , he used a lumin@@ escence to show himself and to show us what he is going to get . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment , filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of dischar@@ ging the pur@@ ging knob of a pull toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical experts about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luckily , nothing left what he no@@ d@@ ded , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine , traveling through the world and eating unique and wonderful things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from public funds to stations to flush toilets of toilets , the task was defini@@ tively put under a test &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told : &quot; as a kid I was relatively worried about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film , he was justified in any case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his test scre@@ ed showed a lumin@@ omet@@ ry of over 4000 units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse after its lumin@@ ance was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands exhibit one of less than 60 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the number of bacterial counts in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the worst thing that I have cleaned in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t dock here , because it is disgu@@ sting here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ ori@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carried out crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming , which ended up saying &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of the gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me so say - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there were things with which it was easier to bring Ian to lick it , and others where it was quite difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 84 per cent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ social family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ me social dwelling in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social dwelling after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a damage of Â£ 50,000 because they had terr@@ orized their neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing association found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the walls laid bare holes , wood floors were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family has been res@@ ett@@ led , and it is believed that she is now living in a private apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many things to consider , as this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family is not@@ orious , and its reputation is also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had done was stre@@ aking street fights with bas@@ eball kill@@ ers , addic@@ ts , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , strings and cur@@ ses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti@@ social behaviour in June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down , old waste was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wood floors were sn@@ apped up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neighbors shou@@ ted that they saw them fighting on the street , and had to call the police regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing o@@ gi@@ oned her and her partner this week forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dol@@ o@@ gi@@ sts were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours , who said their life was made to hell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not listen to anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lived 20 years alongside them , and it was always bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the countless times we say the police here , are incredible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stood up because it was so quiet here , we are not used to it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family had to cooperate with local authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the out@@ grown side of the community house , garbage and old toys were thrown down &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is always the last step to consider the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and had to be horrible for their neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have provided the information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours , and the message conve@@ ys that anti@@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation on the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers in the house administration will have to bury garbage mountains , which surround the house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 the police took a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ als and cash in the amount of Â£ 1,@@ 700 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Skel@@ on received a fine of money after having found itself guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son , Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many walls of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said they will navigate tenants , who do not stick to the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela C@@ row of the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police reported that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was a clear warning to the other tenants , who do not stick to the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about those who think that they can behave without self @-@ reproach , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti@@ social behavior , who will continue to work together with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists in Portugal are panic , after a ti@@ eff@@ er military jet flies over the beach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a portu@@ g@@ isi@@ es@@ ches P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of the Air Force did an incredible crash flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no risk of safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists begin to panic , after a ti@@ eff@@ lying jet crash@@ es over a full beach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost in close proximity to the sun worshi@@ ppers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro , in the north of Portugal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they were understand@@ ably beginning to worry about the noise of the keys , without seeing what came down through the clouds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daniel Fern@@ andes said one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers who posted videos about the dramatic F@@ ly @-@ By in the social media : &quot; it flew two times really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were pan@@ i@@ cked , when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Portuguese Air Force forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and thereby had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spokesman said that the jet flew somewhat deeper than usual due to the poor visibility conditions due to the poor visibility conditions , but the air forces insisted that security was at no time at risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; area fires destroyed part of the Portuguese mainland this summer , with four people coming to death on Madeira Island . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke , which restricted his view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aircraft was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sevilla
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season , on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Catal@@ ans join the Spanish Super@@ cup west@@ wards against the FC Sevilla , the return ticket increases three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fight with the signed Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reign@@ ing Europa League Champion , the Dou@@ ble@@ winner must refrain from N@@ ey@@ mar , who cont@@ ests the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Go@@ alie is also missing Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , with which the request at Bar@@ ca was clari@@ fied at least for the time being in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years now , the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen were ranked as number one in Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coach Luis En@@ rique so far gave up a clear decision and made Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen was the first step in most other applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the first mandatory play of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness status of the team at the Spanish Master who was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test match of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even at 3 : 2 in Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really convince . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sevilla again has the 2 : 3 defeat after renew@@ ing in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves to win the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with so far , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma Long in a league table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and defending champion Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the world @-@ ranking first awarded the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ als tournament and Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese J@@ un Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected , and made the title among each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would bring the single title in the sign of the Five rings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic champi@@ ons was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ã @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the board , between the sentences and with time outs , they had no coaches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had withdrawn into the tri@@ bun@@ e , and left their cont@@ ests in a fair competition alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches up to here I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang had said fol@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the game , gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the match itself was unexpectedly one @-@ sided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his 28 year old opponent , Ma had really to fight only in the first sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang as only a total of 13 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , not the expected ro@@ using match developed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , there were nevertheless enough breathtaking ballo@@ ons to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Miz@@ ut@@ ani , the game was won with bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his quarter final against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ or@@ usi@@ an injured a rib@@ bed injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and JÃ¶r@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were in similar high table tennis @-@ old Olympia @-@ Fourth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big problems &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now faced the weaknesses of his campaign in the Republi@@ can strongh@@ old U@@ tah . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rare moment , in which the Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire is usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confi@@ dently commented as concerns , as correspon@@ dents said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having tos@@ sed 16 ri@@ vals within the own republi@@ can camp , doubts arise in his success in the fight for the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump against evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt : false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his famous media attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
republi@@ can high castles w@@ ack@@ y
U@@ tah is normally a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ or of June , Tr@@ ump and his deputy from the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton equ@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that are common for republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump asked him how to stop Clinton &apos;s advance again : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and whether afterwards : this will either be successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is nothing else than telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it wasn &apos;t enough for him at the end of political correctness , that was fine , Tr@@ ump said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I returned to a very good way of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump party should have threatened to cancel mon@@ ies to support his electoral campaign , he should not be able to present a better survey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of that , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would take stronger grip for Congress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympia : third sc@@ am in dop@@ ing test
IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for athletes , Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second D@@ oping Aff@@ ing at the Rio de Janeiro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a fraud trial in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the International Olympic Committee , as soon as possible to set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary announced that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , left a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was reported by the team leader K@@ eni@@ as of the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IA@@ AF World Federation has asked the IO@@ C for information on the case , to enforce one &apos;s own investigations , divided a IA@@ AF speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will evaluate an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and served as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , handed over and signed the test , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of accreditation of the athlete who was on the list of training checks of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , in Beijing , has become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics He@@ ads of Staff Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he should be informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against cash payments from his country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to media reports , he was arrested on his return at Nairobi airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a long time , Kenya has been under special observation at IO@@ C following numerous dop@@ ing contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the announcement of the more than 2,000 dop@@ ing target controls presented by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted a great deal of pressure on African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , WA@@ DA visited Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of the WA@@ DA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Peking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a series of TV reports of the ARD , there were repeat@@ ed@@ ely alle@@ gations that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he did in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , it was possible to prove that in this sport field and systematically an opt @-@ out was performed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival is presenting the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artistic director of Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music , and fulfilled the role of Maria a night@@ mare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ Ã³n Bol@@ Ã­@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an Con@@ duc@@ tor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he he@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ members Tony with melanch@@ oly , while the younger Mary plays and dances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there would be Mari@@ as personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and funny and bright . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is wise , of course also na@@ Ã¯@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
she is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli says , &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passion@@ ately ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it &apos;s his life ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the &quot; West Side Story &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as they were then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; London &apos;s school@@ girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , allegedly died in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was suspected that they were killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , after her family , died shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war torn country and return to England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is to go into a war zone - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with making this decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school@@ girls from the east of London climbed aboard a plane to Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was informed that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria , and became a widow within a few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d says that in the case of a winner in Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor to the late judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he would not have spoken to Clinton , if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RAID said , Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also discovered that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ idency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women and for men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere , bringing out a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es calendar for 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us in the beginning of this year that his neck magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys was distingu@@ ishing , as &quot; Play@@ boy for men is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , he believes that the calendar also does . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must return to portra@@ yal of timeless and classical nu@@ dity where both women and men feel inspired and feel inspired by these images of a female body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the publication of the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women will want to participate in this project , because it is a beautiful work of art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models can submit their pictures online or in person , at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Turkey : Kurdish community counts with mass curse
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who does not adapt to Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed coff@@ ers , &quot; says the chairman of the GÃ¼@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kurdish community in Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of prot@@ esters , who flee from Turkey to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even become &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the hard drive of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community in Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of prot@@ esters from Turkey in the medium term , when the Erdo@@ gan regime is fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already covered Kurdish strongh@@ olds with imp@@ unity several months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the icy coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start anew in Europe , if they continue to be suppressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that receives refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of Staff compla@@ ined about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the travel pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or marketed in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of Staff demanded that the Federal Government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; is taking place against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German branch of the GÃ¼@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fire marking as a GÃ¼@@ len pendant destroys teachers and other academ@@ ics , the professional existence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever dis@@ likes and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan sits on packed coff@@ ers , inci@@ dentally also the K@@ em@@ alists and SÃ¤@@ kul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the GÃ¼@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as reported by the newspaper , by calling on numbers from the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks settled in Germany before the coup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June 30 , 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all of them have been granted asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this elevation do not find those who are fighting against war , poverty or perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum seekers under the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individual pursu@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign , and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2021 , the Parliament election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more stupid than so far , it &apos;s not going to be : summer holidays , heat and land competition - that bites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaig@@ ners , are on holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers travelling in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , RÃ¼@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so don &apos;t choose the country day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays hel@@ pers , the posters hang up , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and counting on the end votes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and final holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to leave the people over themselves once again during the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD , the strongest party in 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be exciting , how strongly Neul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition dust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as it did his legendary , wor@@ dless ancest@@ or Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from that , seaf@@ ring has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel will blame for the thri@@ ving of Af@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; We create the &quot; have spe@@ eded up the rise of the pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U with its top channel data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make election campaigns at the wrong time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has invited Angela Merkel to big r@@ allies twice ; Chancellor Merkel &apos;s election circuit lies in the northeast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; accused Vincent Co@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it too is a pity not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual competition stalls on market places and before shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , co@@ ca@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noted that on the land you have to dig out the base that it must be very tight to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the v@@ ast@@ ness of the country hardly exists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U campaig@@ ner Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they have to go where they hurt , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because there is a lot on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in surveys , the S &amp; Ds last last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had become clear with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green , small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should make the leap into the country day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they make a modern virtue out of their holiday necessity , and shift their election campaign largely into the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calls the president Claudia MÃ¼ller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on a search for local stimul@@ i among the holi@@ day@@ makers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ eth straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at across the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 remedi@@ ation : catering facilities suffer from closure
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the speed with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to complain about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 8 o &apos;clock , there are all praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made everything pretty jag@@ ged , &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff tells about the Jet gas station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no distortion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the remuneration is also commen@@ ded to the construction of those responsible for construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of emergency services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the closure of the asphalt road in O@@ mar d@@ ingen has been lifted and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the traffic situation within the village has been relaxed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the citizens can now cycle on both sides from O@@ don@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the avoid@@ ance of ev@@ asive action seems to go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was partly significant discomfort , &quot; says the deputy prime minister Florian King responsible for the transport management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the residents of Bach &apos;s Road , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straÃe , Haf@@ ner@@ straÃe and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping routes were seeking and rather familiar to their Nav@@ i as the sig@@ nage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what led to this , some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ tic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the assembly demanded an increasing number of M@@ Ã¶s@@ singen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable exceed@@ ances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says King , who himself made herself aware of the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , two to three per minute have been las@@ hed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 77 hours of ho@@ ur@@ ly , the fastest was on the way in the pace @-@ 30 zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the construction site has moved on , it became qui@@ eter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for business people at the B 27 , it is only a little consol@@ ation that the street is now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that the B 27 remedi@@ ation has led to revenue out@@ breaks , everyone you ask can look through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some more and some are less affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; so for other companies , the rehabilitation has little consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also acknow@@ le@@ dges that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the locals are most heavily exploited , along the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J. Albert G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner , propriet@@ or of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants were hard hit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue revenue is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; street painting abandoned its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of his employees have to be dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been fired , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , government president JÃ¶rg Schmidt on request von G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , would benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner knows of other districts , where something more generous was handled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all complaints , G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the family business is located here since 17@@ 15 , refers to the long history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the complicated traffic management , other regular guests can see less frequently due to complicated traffic management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can &apos;t go back , it &apos;s also nice elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the refurb@@ ishment work , his master clientele has no doubts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu , G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner sees the impact of B 27 construction on its clientele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six months of construction work , which is already brutal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constantly , laws are being scre@@ wed in the name of fighting terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks , interior ministers de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re now presents a thick security package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what has a criminal status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re is the trav@@ eller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they over@@ take no one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this , too , I pray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Minister of the Interior , however , he was placed on results and at a &quot; real@@ is@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks in WÃ¼rzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re won a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these are all the more extensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are already known , announced , pointed out , that a new security authority should take care of the crack of encrypted communication is not new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU targets on air passenger data and ce@@ ase@@ fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities , as well , does not come as a surprise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re takes up a second attempt to suggest that the SPD has not yet to do with the SPD : he wants to place sympath@@ iz@@ ations for terrorist groups under penalty and knock jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he still believes it is reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything , which does not have any chances in the coalition partner anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few new ideas , de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re , also presents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have , in part , in themselves : he plans rapid procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities to arrest people before deportation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees , who are targeted specifically into the country , should check their smartphones in advance and reveal social media accounts for a security check . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of complaints for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than previously - such as commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of them are politically and legally , however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some things are still uncomfortable , and leave questions un@@ answered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of Ged@@ a , for example , the question arises : what does it have to do with safety and terror ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it cannot be said that the kill@@ ers of Ans@@ bach and WÃ¼rzburg were refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the face of the high number of refugees , many people were worried about security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and things that hurt people deeply , could not be sorted out in election campaign periods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inner security is enormously advanced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the attacks in WÃ¼rzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yes , there are electoral matches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly placing themselves in position in the subject of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days , between the two parties , it went high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a gar@@ ris@@ ky dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some union interior ministers , in which the resort chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a break away from double citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re is also struggling here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a departure from the double pass , he holds nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we satisfied the discussion in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not sensible , however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with a ban on bur@@ kas , he has no constitutional objec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package at all corners is constitutional and if it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot inside , which could take care of stri@@ fe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the SPD is also trying to gain inner security in the subject of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel only briefly signals the willingness to talk and say , &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further enhance safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen got off lightly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite diesel engines , the delivery numbers increase worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it does not run around in all markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recall action , there are vor@@ ti@@ ces for a term . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen starts in the second half of the year when deliveries are delivered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to boast a plus in spite of diesel aff@@ aires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July , the core brand VW , especially in Western Europe , slow@@ ed down the overall sales , as the company announced in Da@@ x . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July , the brand VW sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Western Europe alone , China &apos;s second @-@ largest market alone , sales rose 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the home market in Germany , deliveries declined by almost a sixth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; head of sales JÃ¼rgen St@@ ack@@ mann introduced the weaker figures from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , a &quot; changed economic environment &quot; has given a sales retreat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote was also bur@@ dened by the British vote , a spokes@@ woman explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ gas was calibr@@ ated first , a minus is also available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , the primarily affected household brand of Lower Saxony will continue to get off lightly through the diesel scandal : after the first seven months there is only a minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from January to July , Executive Vice President Fred Kap@@ pler continued to advance sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , Volkswagen provided 1.3 percent more vehicles , 5.@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust testing software .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million wag@@ ons to upgrade to the workshops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the conversion , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the conversion of vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after upgrading the car , the car has a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was announced on Friday in company circles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now offered its German customers a guarantee of equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was confirmed last Monday , Volkswagen representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Ministry of Transport , this meeting was confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my investig@@ ative commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; explained Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after retro@@ fitting and all type @-@ relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen himself used the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was named in business circles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , customers come into a workshop for example half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the interest of customers , it is important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the risk of ab@@ duction , as it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires rich savers in future , as a second institute in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only 139 customers who can park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German Banking speaks of an individual case and sees that there is no signal : normal savers would not have to worry about paying for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deposit money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.4 percent penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fee re@@ charges the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over â¬ 100,000 to Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily bank accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 people will cost â¬ 400 in the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been protecting 40 million euros for some time , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not exploit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; said the banking manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the cost is now proceeding further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to leave the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank saf@@ es would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already seen four cases , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most customers would have understood , and changed to other types of investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy creates considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to bear it alone is &quot; economically not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Thur@@ in@@ gian People and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Union , said : &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay for deposits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele that is luxuri@@ ant equipped by the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative bank G@@ mund founded in 1911 has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; renowned actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , no further banks are known to the cooperative association Bayern , which will charge a replacement for deposits by private customers , &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the German National Bank and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ Ã¶h@@ lich , declared the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , the customers in Germany will not enjoy themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men of middle @-@ aged love plates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you rush to comment , to skip it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of non @-@ Alle@@ en@@ ame men of middle aged men with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of sound plates is not attributable to a boom in millenni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who recently bought a record , all for@@ esi@@ ght is between 45 and 54 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also no hor@@ des through hobby gather@@ ers - it has an emotional impact : older record buyers only retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v correct ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow the camera as I am walking in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit and a bit more intimate thing like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sales@@ men were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record special stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men , one woman , presumably around 20 ) , is one day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and pl@@ under@@ side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60 &apos;s , early 70 &apos;s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I was probably too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , believes that many customers meeting on You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard about the album , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and re@@ viewing their old records . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the conversations I conducted , people tend to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom to supporters of the record revi@@ vals of a specific age .
but what about the supposed emotional importance of plates ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to recognize that record stores have a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took advantage of the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound plates , from objects that recall happy youth memories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of empt@@ iness or possessing material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is with me as collectors , and I think it is so with many people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a simple way to get involved spiritually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insti@@ lled a staff of a plate stack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , have not yet listened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time of the message report , I would probably look very worried as I smo@@ other through a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone just arrived here and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead vinyl record so that I can put them on the shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a great percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more productive and less musical @-@ like .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are younger people , not older people who only come in slowly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a lower audience than I enter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle aged women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts New Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ ed pop instead of experimental jazz - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of them looks strange , but serious mental trauma is difficult to determine if one stands beside someone for 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs in business for several minutes and considers the variety of plates standing for sale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it makes a window mannequ@@ in rather than a shopping mall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not deserve much , therefore collecting plates is not a real option , it says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of records is ... it drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to explain it , it &apos;s really unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I am giving the impression to mu@@ zzle the jeans for a moment , I observe a group of young teen@@ age girls who want to group for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of panels from Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far that it is impossible to touch them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but considering that any attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and send some customers into the depths Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if my investigations showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they leave , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors that exist in reality , record stores and online forums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not with stro@@ lling through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and leaves by plates , while they steer clear of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ false moder@@ ator who rises above the shoulders of uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting middle @-@ aged men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gr@@ Ã¶n@@ land@@ hai is the longest living verteb@@ ral - video layer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientific say , that the Gr@@ Ã¶n@@ land@@ hai has the longest life span of all verteb@@ rates on the planet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen , who examined the sh@@ arks , says that the record was with a female from which it is assumed that it is between 27@@ 2 and 5@@ 12 years old and five meters long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle camps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state was authorized to sell 72 temporary shops in which individuals sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dresser or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places were to be torn down , because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that a fire and san@@ ity risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
humanitarian groups shared the court that businesses and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , they suggested that temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary shops , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture by Cal@@ ais were absolutely track@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than to feed people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the places threatened by the low @-@ price was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &quot; cafÃ© of the camp which is useful for serving and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 17@@ 0@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &quot; CafÃ© . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of those living in the Dsch@@ el@@ ell@@ ager had risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains fighting
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his dis@@ appointing appearance in the Olympic season , cyclists Tony Martin will not be able to get under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I continue to keep the World Cup in sight , remain confident and fight , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the Zu@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly think it &apos;s hard to comment on the timing of yesterday &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let us analyse the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the F@@ WC in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also includes my position , &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion who had lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4,5 km for more than three minutes on Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian C@@ anc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sie@@ gem@@ und , which was pla@@ gu@@ ed by back problems , was able to beat its impact only once and was power@@ less compared to previous rounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , An@@ geli@@ que Ker@@ ber ( Kiel / No. 2 ) had a chance to jump into the circuit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ er must adapt to the next generation of speed meas@@ ur@@ ers : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , which are to effectively over@@ lap the tem@@ pe@@ faces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used in accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , at highway construction sites or to sandy bridges with temporary speed police , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is adher@@ ed to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a permanent mobile construction , however , can be too dangerous or complex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days in un@@ interrupted measuring operation , and the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks simultaneously using laser measurement technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; variable speed limit@@ ers as well as access b@@ ans to time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state , the trailer can be fitted with every car with trailer coupling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that it is not easily st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also disappear into the outer shell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , following an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
United Kingdom picks up silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class picks gold
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ odor@@ o stage here in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fi@@ ji made a master class in handling , side st@@ eppe , back , line and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic med@@ als of any colour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defeat was missed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in this form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GB had a difficult path .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight years ago , they lost every game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , they lost only one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fi@@ ji started wonderful , leaving the attacks G@@ Bs out of fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if you were running into driving buses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with four minutes playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly accepted the ball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a stunning T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third gate , but Fi@@ ji only stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the seventh minute , the Y@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua flew a touch@@ down in the right corner and stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa has added a new one since the beginning , and there was still a minute of playing time ... in the first half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still learning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is how it is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GB introduced basic changes in half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went well for a long time in favour of the SÃ¼d@@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ian whose fans sang and danced on the grand@@ stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and the UK ki@@ cked in the grass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi@@ fin@@ als of 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a tight semi @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton left the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer for rowing victory
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be no em@@ ot@@ omy gold than with these games , and that wants to be called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve that go into history Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all their 3@@ 9th un@@ written effort , which is also unprecedented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we see are two brilliant girls gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind every gold in the rowing a batt@@ ali@@ on is involved in willing hel@@ pers who make the difference , and no one ever knew if he was diagnosed with cancer this day before 30 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had bladder cancer , which is operated and that &apos;s what they did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , which kept the interruption to a minimum , if that is the right term in such circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I needed money , so I had to go back soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is how it begins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rowing in itself is already a challenge , but this makes it even bigger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve @-@ growing morning spent a bit more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning said as captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I and Hel@@ en , and also Robin worked to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person , or better coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not have a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were very caught at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ en cried , &quot; Sta@@ y in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we were not prepared to make something great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we didn &apos;t want a fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the Steve Back@@ shall TV adventure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was all so new to me , and I was stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 31 years , exemplary of clarity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Managing Director of the Water Pur@@ chase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; goes into retirement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a small , Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some time ago , it was called in the original on a post by Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia damaged the purpose of the purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ stein &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is regarded as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller , who was a member of the German association for 31 years , was 28 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , Municip@@ ality Breit@@ brun@@ n , fo@@ sters about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water every year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member communities are the municipalities Kirch@@ der , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for further cities and municipalities , there are water supply contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n May@@ bach Ger@@ tru@@ d BÃ¼h@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller has been appointed a water@@ jet in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ ecker in 1988 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his duties have been very diverse , and they extended the planning and maintenance of office and organisation activities , the budget@@ ing planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency &quot; on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an outstanding event , she called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no stand@@ still , and I have always added innovations because water is the most important food in life and drinking water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her Lau@@ dati@@ o , she praised Go@@ dless faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has worked with a lot of heart @-@ blood for his water @-@ purpose @-@ association , and he has been living under the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success of the v@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group to reduce nit@@ rates before the Water Forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , he received very much recognition and praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller , on his part praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together with him for 28 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is the best water@@ jet , and he was a faithful boy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as highlights from his point of view , he called the well @-@ building and the restructuring of the purpose association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were , however , the tube breaking at the floo@@ ding tank near Kirch@@ der on a 3rd of January . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n was only possible to maintain , because one was filled with hoses from the high can@@ ister of P@@ ett@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel StÃ¼r@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who followed the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other concerned parents : &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 year old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she must die . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the eight @-@ year @-@ old ti@@ ago , however , was well forward and now learn privately in New York where it is the best therap@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : when I ask him something that dates back two years when I sang in La Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the Bass@@ bar@@ it@@ on Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .

relationship at Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting at life partner
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man fired on his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district of Stor@@ mar@@ n ) and wounded them to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called us and declared his partner to be shot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after whom I will be punished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a bald . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the man is wearing a bald . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could still carry the weapon , so the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who sees Sven S. , will call the 110 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police are talking about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the cul@@ pri@@ t 1981 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first , the police in LÃ¼@@ beck did not want to provide information about the departure or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; however , she confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a matter of killing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this moment , &quot; said a police spokesperson in LÃ¼@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial burdens , which threatened the sector from the green electricity promotion , are from the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Shift at existing plants for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , Federal Economics Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) said the &quot; West German General Paper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers , who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption , at checkout . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is now a certificate with the European Commission after discussions with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills , an EEG reform is 20 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these are not raised in the steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission on self @-@ production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel is future &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weighed down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall CEO JÃ¶rg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy as the world &apos;s largest producer of gro@@ wers raised massive steel on the world market in view of the weaker domestic demand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
European manufacturers throw out price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has eased somewhat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have bri@@ gh@@ tened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unclear , however , how sustainable the price recovery is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp , the German branch of industry , was cautious on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp had not wanted to exclude the closing of individual works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July , the German steel producers are cautious in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they produced a good six percent less crude steel with 3.4 million tonnes compared to the previous year &apos;s month , as steel was announced on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a short increase in May , the quantity produced now returned to the second month in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming months , the Association anticip@@ ates an improved order situation thanks to an improved order situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; community , Spirit , Health : singing Sen@@ iors good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the singing of Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 year old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; singing is moving - emotion@@ ally and physically &quot; she describes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall alive , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler goes from the German Senior Res@@ ear@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describing H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social and family structures often dissolve in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also has taken Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing can be stress@@ ful in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , sen@@ iors practice deep and controlled breathing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever challenges his lungs regularly , is not so fast out of the pu@@ ste in everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when it comes to getting the sound of voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on older people , singing is often a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the German Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , it explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or hearing songs in older people aw@@ akes a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through songs of lyrics and especially melodies , people with dementia care about long past events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in singing , the head also requires a special performance , explained L@@ enz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , focus on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt oneself to the other singers - that &apos;s a big cognitive challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just elderly people , who live alone , do so not only concentrate on themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great compli@@ ment .
self @-@ esteem is also growing through singing in the choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to show yourself : if I have a long time for something , I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to try out a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks you have little talent , L@@ enz advises L@@ enz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes wrong ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone sings of the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior choir , one can simply join . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to sing in a church choir , you can contact the church or church leader directly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to sing , you should join a choir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing does the soul well , and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for every age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cats react more sensi@@ tively than han@@ go@@ ver at the cry of the young
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect is the calling of cat babies on adult animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to their surprise the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not let the males cold - however , they kept in contrast to the females always the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; female cats can recognize the reg@@ ression rate of cat babies , at the mi@@ st@@ av@@ age of the little ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they respond by ten percent faster to the sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , who found themselves in great distress , as scientists have found out by the Veter@@ inary University and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however , always the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the acousti@@ cal differences between mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young animals for the males either are not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is the first author of the study published this Friday in the &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the caus@@ tic scre@@ am differs with the ur@@ gency of their dependency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , nine adult males and eight female cats were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were played for a cry of little ones , taken from the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with shou@@ ting of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens that were raised in addition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the low sample of sample , the researchers retain their results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they turned faster to the speaker , when this ru@@ p played the very excited kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this ability may be con@@ genital , or develop with the sexually mature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski reaches Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ ver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , a major football match is held in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the du@@ el of the Erz@@ riv@@ alen between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul round the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already in the im@@ position of the state of emergency after the overthrow attempt in July , the government , the daily life of normal br@@ ush@@ ers should not be com@@ promised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the Movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah GÃ¼@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the football doesn &apos;t stop too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against the former strong German Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ ku@@ r , the prosecution issued an arrest warrant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SÃ¼@@ kis@@ r should be supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah GÃ¼@@ len , who is held accoun@@ table by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the state of emergency is still valid for 90 days , it actually has no effect on the life of most Turks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country declared its end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents , Erdo@@ gan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially fans of the Bes@@ ik@@ tas &quot; Club do not traditionally belong to the president &apos;s friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in view of dramatic experiences in history , the revolt of the Turks is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the fans agree , whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ al Win@@ ner &quot; Gala , &quot; it will especially arrive to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past season , Cologne proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all cont@@ ests , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as the top sc@@ orer of his club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finished the season in an excellent way , and his team secured the tro@@ phy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory finish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the qualification round @-@ K.@@ O. in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also turn out early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Southern Li@@ g , there was only one rank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to gain something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have done this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year of play was better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who served as SÃ¼@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment@@ enk@@ Ã¶@@ nig the basis for the 14th title , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the Gom@@ ez agreement with the Treaty of Florence and Bes@@ ik@@ tas announced that it was not announced after the coup attempt , due to the political situation in the country after his EM vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wishes to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; the specialist magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club@@ man F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the stor@@ mer would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce about a third of his estimated â¬ 7.5 million , Or@@ man realized : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite D@@ oping , these athletes have med@@ als of med@@ als at Olympic Games in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ g@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other over@@ run athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it , they fight in Rio for med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of dop@@ ing continues to be the head@@ lines for the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had pla@@ gu@@ ed her starting right in front of the games , was mer@@ cil@@ essly fl@@ attered and rested on her start ( 100 meters chest ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with a s@@ miles of smile she was still in the hall , provo@@ king with her appearance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was fixed that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a jubil@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there are many other athletes , who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here &apos;s an overview :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had already been closed for two times , because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its inc@@ eption , the 2004 Olympic champion is even faster than before , and is the number one in the world over 100 metres in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest challenge of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit on a six @-@ month lock after having been demonstrated using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an operation , she had severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Per@@ kovic denied the oral ing@@ es@@ tion , and was closed for six months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the four far@@ th@@ est throws this year go to the account of the big gold favorite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ry ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been tested positive 2010 and stopped 21 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a means of penis enlargement was responsible , eu@@ than@@ ized mar@@ bles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ole , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete had so many med@@ als later identified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after having found testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand in Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European Championship because of testosterone abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games , which was also recognised by the International Sports Court , received the award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 metres , he ranked second in the world ranking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km of walking , China ) : the world record and gold@@ favor@@ i@@ tin was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , notes were found on taking a banned food supplement , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell sof@@ tly and went off on July 13 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ Ã¶@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she suffered chi@@ ves and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her journey home , she planned for the beginning of September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ al , Austrian citizens are still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ Ã¶@@ ll . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of det@@ on@@ ation close to the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured following police information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban employee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the authorities , the blast was put into the air by the authorities in a flower be@@ et in front of the territory police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , some det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on on the south @-@ eastern coast claimed several injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; said Army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ am@@ av@@ ee Friday morning ahead of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to say about possible motives , but most likely it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the attacks , Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical for the bom@@ b@@ ate rate of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or international terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited territories and provinces , &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , one assumes that bombs have been placed by the enemies of the military jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , the authorities have kept secret references to imminent attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is unclear which group behind the attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police showed their officials all over the country to reinforce security around major government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Hu@@ a H@@ in , there is a palace which was used over the years by Thai King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the well @-@ founded bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , it is not necessary to travel to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution , elabor@@ ated by the jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives the military a great influence over the coming years , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jun@@ ta chief and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the military jun@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody uph@@ eav@@ al , will benefit itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is aimed at the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several regional offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists have also placed the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; clu@@ es for efforts against the free democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , immigrants from Islamic faith , or from the Middle East , are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , we observe the movement now also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; identical movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is directed against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass influ@@ x &quot; and &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitu@@ tion@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ WÃ¼rttemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities agreed with the regional offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &apos; identical movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the identi@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a concrete advertisement , for one &apos;s own cause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the propaganda is intended to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , from several federal states there have been reports of contacts of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identification &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the constitutional protection , potential contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it depends on whether the party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , the decisive factor is whether such persons are controlling the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not recognizable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the substantial increase in legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent years , we have established that there can be right @-@ wing opportun@@ ist structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Old School Society &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Old School Society &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there may be other terrorist groups or small groups that plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugees or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the existing groups were created on the regional level , or in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , Ma@@ ate expressed concern that many attacks went to the account of people who had previously appeared in the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the susp@@ ects on Asyl@@ um attacks were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have thus committed off@@ ences that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which might have been politically in@@ different or , for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , which then radi@@ cal@@ ised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not always , the Olympic Games or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this shows the bold performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly obes@@ e s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly swa@@ m that he could no longer see in the TV images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply disappeared , no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te was then turned into viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the 24 year old stopped its previous race with a gap of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it was rather his rather sporty figure , which attracted the attention of the international media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the international swimming association , the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start @-@ up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since most athletes are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quickly , the first nick@@ names made the lap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some media recorded it as &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; was funny with D@@ ad B@@ od . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his time , he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metre open @-@ up style , played no role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ se@@ ban@@ i &apos;s run caused media attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to travel alone in a run over 100 metres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , m@@ ous@@ se@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics , and before the competition had never had such a long distance before the competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in left their business on Monday at 17.@@ 30 and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tr@@ ump sees the lo@@ oming electoral defeat not so close
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump refers to a presidential campaign in Florida .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should it be done with the election to the U.S. president , Donald Tr@@ ump has an alternative video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , he is driving into the holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will be either , or I have a very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the U.S. TV station CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it was not enough for him at the end of political correctness , that was fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he described the US president Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist milit@@ ant Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
post is entering the trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell her electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of the coming year , the Post Office wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get into the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company has been checking for months whether they will be delivered to their own Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets , even to other companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; post @-@ Managing Director JÃ¼rgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always re @-@ en@@ quiries , such as craftsmen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn Group plans to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ger@@ des announced that the company wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and , in the long run , made a complete change@@ over to the eco @-@ friendly vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can imagine , that we will change the whole fleet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gf@@ K conduc@@ tion steps after dis@@ appointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the feedback came suddenly , but not quite surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K has made an impression that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes more in@@ secure , the longer the success promised by him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after once again dis@@ appointing business figures and the resignation of corporate management the worldwide number five of the industry is facing a new beginning .
Gf@@ K Chief Executive Officer wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Council , Ar@@ no Mahler , already dischar@@ ges from the Supervisory Board with effect on September 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of September 1 , the management board of the Executive Board will take over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ print@@ inger , who informed the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is supposed to officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business orientation as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for details , a company spokesperson should not be called on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , anyone who will be leading the market research company is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , on Friday , in the shareholders , the disappointment on the continuing success of the restructuring of the previous years had been great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2011 , Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder will be rest@@ less at some point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that were the case with BMW , that would make the qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the Company won &apos;t be able to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , revenue was 6.@@ 1 percent below the level of the comparable year @-@ earlier quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the first half @-@ year , sales fell by 3.4 percent to EUR 7@@ 2@@ 1,2 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter especially affected the Group &apos;s s@@ unken value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company &apos;s value depreciation of 139 million euros , which has become necessary in the Consumer Experience division , gave the Group a loss of â¬ 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated a net income of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accidents - bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ horns in dit@@ ch : eight injured
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of an accident of a travel coach with 43 senior citizens , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ oud ( District Aur@@ ich ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries , and reported the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , had to ev@@ ade an opposing layer that partly drove on the opposite lane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance arrived at the provincial road 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the un@@ injured trav@@ eller was brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ horns district , P@@ ew@@ sum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators demanded the load experience , and possible witnesses to report to the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the charges per cubic meter of waste water from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant of Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ h@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will then increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a huge calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ hÃ¤user ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the household of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , the municipal council of Kul@@ mb@@ ach discovered that under@@ cover for these sewage plants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to legal bases , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the equipment free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 1 October 2016 , citizens and industrial and industrial companies from the world , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ on , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to fall deeper into the wal@@ let . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 48 and 67 percent , the increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Chief Executive Officer Herbert Schmidt showed up to the committee , a new calculation of charges for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period must also be offset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all three wastewater facilities , the gra@@ vi@@ ating fee increased by relatively small facilities with a very low waste water drop , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low distribution base for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , waste water in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , in the covered calculation period in all three plants , plum@@ bing and repair expenses fell in a considerable amount due to its age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ th@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage , in the az@@ endorf wastewater treatment plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dischar@@ ged , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation system needed to be installed in order to meet the water legal requirements in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses came from the continued assistance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants , the expendi@@ tures for operation and maintenance were &quot; full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Schmidt , added to the market community of large entertainment costs in the waste water installations in the past 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to stone houses , the situation for the mentioned plants will remain prec@@ arious in the long term as one cannot extend the supply area of the sewage disposal association Fri@@ esen@@ ba@@ cht@@ al in order to not extend these facilities because it concerns deficit @-@ making facilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bulgaria booked inflation for the first time in 8 months
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; national statistics show that in July , inflation was 1 % on a monthly basis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0,@@ 8 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 was 1,@@ 0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % , and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July 2016 a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; Transport ( 6.@@ 3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prices remained as in pre @-@ month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
snapshot &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critic@@ ised as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows some 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the filters are unver@@ sion@@ ed , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ fies per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all mis@@ ses arrive to the public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have critic@@ ised themselves in which they were accused that the app Black@@ face promoted or white skin would prop@@ agate as beauty ideal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wondered whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem , that the company has diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters , not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter reminded of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ Ã©s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others refused the Ani@@ me Com@@ par@@ ison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , wrote in an e @-@ mail that T@@ we@@ et was widespread over the photos that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and least unpleasant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ proof , but that the yel@@ low@@ ish face was pulled into the wi@@ dening extreme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Snap@@ ch@@ ats a large audience of young people , who are different in terms of race different than their older opponents - could expect more sensitivity to expect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one of the Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture that is offensive for a user , &quot; so it &apos;s much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case . &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and urged others to do the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an essay for medium and telep@@ hon@@ y interview , she said she believes that racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices at Snap@@ chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the big part white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they have no various representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chin@@ ese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Snap@@ chat un@@ answered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce , and points to its status as a private enterprise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ woman , the company recently hired a staff responsible for sub @-@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu , for her part , said she closed her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military leadership for@@ fei@@ ts IS@@ IS intelligence service , sets up Committee of Congress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command revised intelligence information in order to draw an optimistic view of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as an investigation committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the armed forces of armed forces , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors had changed their app@@ rais@@ al to the American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; central Command , shortly c@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence Information received from high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders typically signed a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on the ground were allowed and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; commented Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there are no direct indications that government leaders have given orders under Obama to change reports , it shows how analysts exposed their superi@@ ors to the pressure from their superi@@ ors , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , comments and statements in front of the congress were much more positive than it meets the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could commen@@ ce in April or May 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , it is so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the task force to live after them , that analysts began to worry about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings , while the investigations will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are underway in the Ministry of Defence of the Ministry of Defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings that agree with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can task force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ com created an exc@@ essively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest representative Brother Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; did the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; gave exc@@ essively low space for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Shi@@ p and Democrats did not give any indication of any intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ com analysts in terms of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specific political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last August , the New York Times reported by the Pentagon inspec@@ tor , which was taken up following complaints by Cent@@ com analysts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokesman , gave an opinion that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the congress , while investigating the General In@@ spec@@ torate was still underway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense will welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigation goes beyond the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of President Obama to rely on the Central Command for military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of Z@@ wis@@ s of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , saw only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to indicate that the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group since these temporary refin@@ eries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature because of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; general Austin was retired in April , and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the United States wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain is imminent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after she shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team in a match against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember ever to have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they do not know : the Americans are at the Olympic competition at 4 @-@ 0 and equ@@ ate in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday , in the last round of the first round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two teams will gain the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first placed one will take a little longer out of the way , which will lead the other group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans triggered a surprising vor@@ tex four years after they landed at the last of 12 places during the last London Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in her hands ( her two older sisters played sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , as she could not qualify for the cad@@ re . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , became a coach of the National Team and thus began to turn to the better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , mental change and physical change , &quot; B@@ am said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did not have the work@@ space in London , which we now have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have completely ro@@ ared up the ruin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and pulled the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amidst the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and in@@ es@@ capable , a fast relay between competition and pursuit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick , which is served by the watch@@ strap for s@@ wimm@@ ers to the gym@@ n@@ ast for tri@@ athletes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queu@@ es in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s s@@ warm with dimples , could have been under these known names to be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising if he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic tra@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted : aerial shots , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always have the breast @-@ swimming , and may it reign for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if I would like to make certain arguments for my particular favourite , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete char@@ me of the trampoline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the trampoline was an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was so spar@@ se that many people I had asked were not aware that it was an Olympic sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the USA sent athletes to compete , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete from reaching the end of 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jumping on a trampoline has a certain out@@ sider , partly because it sounds more suitable for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than for the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert but just a d@@ elec@@ table enthusi@@ ast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and scuba diving , the two sports which it unites essentially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means so much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emerging champi@@ ons jump on a giant trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , hat@@ ching and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will be assessed according to official olymp@@ ic program according to execution , difficulty and flight time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two @-@ time athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; med@@ alists have to continue in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and above , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes down and down , down@@ wards and down@@ wards on the playground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall , but also in television transmission another height @-@ oriented goal : the world or the Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the purpos@@ eful quest is pos@@ h , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also what I feel like being a bit ti@@ ring , even when watching these games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , moves upwards , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back upwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a competition here , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s as Zen like the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying and opening hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds , as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the Ang@@ let and the objective qualification of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the United States &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters who demand political changes in Ethiopia launched a violent resistance from the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses testify that tens of prot@@ esters were killed while cl@@ ashes with the police during shooting .
is Ethiopia just breaking together ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the last few months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was ruth@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witnesses testified that polic@@ emen were shot up and killed on un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in circulation videos on the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a detailed investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Nigeria , Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorism against the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , obtain so much Western aid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a resp@@ ectable pace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis , A@@ be@@ ba . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced , with dissi@@ dents being effectively put into silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the v@@ ast@@ ness of the desert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and do not have any other options out of protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation protests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold , in relation to the power of the ruling coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a far @-@ reaching election last year , the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this sha@@ ky , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts believe that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ des that have been forced to take advantage of turbul@@ ence and re @-@ arm themselves in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness , after years of hiding behind , explo@@ de under the surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones were becoming increasingly common and improved internet services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter what they do at regular intervals , most of all in protests , many people still can communicate over internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several young Ethiop@@ ians gave their way to protests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as who mainly come from Ethiopia are mainly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economy as they exploit the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is changing too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ res@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is largely dominated by members of the ethnic group of the tig@@ ray who make up about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military and in the secret services of commerce and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up to his death on a non @-@ public illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was considered as a tactical genius , a man who could think around corners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in using early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special agents to process opponents , and to make them harmless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ transparent reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services monitored by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of poll@@ s prot@@ ested that were apparently fal@@ si@@ fied by the government and then st@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest proceeded relatively quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , like the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty allevi@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but obviously , this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal gri@@ ev@@ ance of the Ethiop@@ ian government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it takes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month prot@@ esters attacked in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ ental city , of tig@@ ray @-@ led shops and the hatred towards the tig@@ ray becomes increasingly common@@ place in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts say that the protests the US and other Western allies bring into a peculiar position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though she recently announced that she closed this base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally collap@@ sing in an already volatile area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin line of congratulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim to Obama that IS@@ IS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign , attacking his multiple repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clarification has raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and easily with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also brings along his comrades who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase of protection , in the peculiar position he could not have meant at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump rested on the asser@@ tion that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was absolutely serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last storm of criticism le@@ ashes Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton had speeches about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using Twitter , he warned that Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one linguistic boundaries in politics , and then return to demand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are absorbed by his fans as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communications expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more corro@@ sive sound as its survey values have gone further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , published on Friday , showed a lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his humour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but while he increasingly focuses on attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump Scher@@ ze has put his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ atively his statements may be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent interc@@ essors , gave himself a great effort to defend candidates from Thursday today in a CN@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani was asked whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ bit@@ ers , completely wrong and so it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans argue that the government under Obama , in which Clinton was serving as Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressive under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and presented them to all of his words and to be taken against him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , miserable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ologies , as only a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once pushed over the price from the market , CafÃ© comes back to Green@@ point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a stylish cafÃ© in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , which sold Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local people , as the last loss , entered a gent@@ ri@@ fying city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ag wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel now excep@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if New York is changing , then it &apos;s also new invention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old cafÃ© , the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he began to work in Ver@@ b in 2001 , and remained there until the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he offered him a client to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez : 36 .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ n@@ ings like cap@@ ers and sau@@ cep@@ an onions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are natural travel keys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cafÃ© serves no beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently on a Sunday , Re@@ be@@ cca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the club closed , she gave a coffee break for a while , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that liked me , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i tea instead of their usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the verb in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal is another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he went there before work , and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said , he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays , Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he didn &apos;t take a res@@ ent@@ ment , that the soap business inherited the old business space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for bre@@ wing with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the cafÃ© as an ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will still respond to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the cafÃ© . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new client has translated the menu to Polish , and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he pre@@ tended to release her so that his new neighbours are welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice shop would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the cafÃ© is expanded to a neighbouring building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many customers , a new verb is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer , and said he was destroyed by the ground than the cafÃ© closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt was saying that entering the restaurant and the bri@@ tish started to feel a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his accession to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a gour@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ Ã¢@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Sp@@ acious soup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his menu on that day was somewhat more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Hei@@ ghts and are both food historians .
Co@@ es &apos;s last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA during bri@@ ck@@ laying in their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; An decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small schn@@ Ã¶r@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the re@@ porter appointed Hack@@ ney , this was the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which extends the ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been placed in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teams of women cook for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central topic , &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as tense was the new budget : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ole became stap@@ le foods that recy@@ cle c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers &quot; as coo@@ ks could hide unnecessary ingredients under a C@@ ret@@ an sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for many years , became a rare luxury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unique mixes were tried out , as high @-@ calorie and nutri@@ tious grati@@ fication had priority over taste or even healthy food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during their research for the book which includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was no more popular addition to lunch , &quot; Co@@ e says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the domestic recipes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as never before or since then , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country are so similar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household politicians &quot; and the challenge to turn P@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly tasty are the reports of the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ mir @-@ pie @-@ eating @-@ attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant kitchen in his kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ million man from the world to which he became . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cooking like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room , carrying a smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was really strange to reality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to make an est@@ amp with his stomach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as described in the book , the president of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors led by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the land came back to the legs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when writing the book , the couple had better understood the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brick was remembered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind@@ fall incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e pulled out a dessert , which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um recipe , the President Roos@@ ev@@ elt did eat lunch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick to give a nice name to modest recipes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone showed a spoon in the t@@ ins , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprisingly , it was not bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E recovered three times a stroke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save the lives of others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 people lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses , and to provide first aid in the war zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the Civil Defence , showing him during an 11 hour rescue of an inf@@ ancy from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it made the Syrians a shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to the image : &quot; for me , that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before O@@ mar fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the helicop@@ ters threw four drums over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb , so that not children play with it , &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deadly bomb of Assad regime had to hit terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gr@@ Ã¶n@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ ral is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland h@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an investigation , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born in 16@@ 24 , he swi@@ ms with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gr@@ Ã¶n@@ land@@ sh@@ arks only get up with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lei@@ surely the Greenland swi@@ ms along the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour he reaches 1,@@ 220 metres on average . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when it matters , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.8 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this lifestyle , characterized by slow@@ ness , seems to be a patent recipe for a high age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case from a Gr@@ Ã¶n@@ land@@ shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity &quot; , Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein comments from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which is a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland will become stone @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Greenland h@@ arks are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in the winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s ha@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they had six animals carrying a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard , their slow @-@ flight took them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , this sh@@ arks make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for cad@@ aver , which from higher water layers down tor@@ ches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland h@@ arks that catch fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 cm measured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens core of the sh@@ arks with the Carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this centre of the eye lens occurs already before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two smallest sh@@ arks had a stri@@ k@@ ingly high carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucleus , notably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hence , their birth should lie in the early 1960s as nuclear weapons seek greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers , the lens nucleus , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 out of the atomic weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , all major Greenland sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes in their lens core , resulting in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers might be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Gr@@ Ã¶n@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the researchers could associate the length of an old age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood on the threshold of the sexually mature , and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland &apos;s reproduction evi@@ dently leave for at least one and a half centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that such meth@@ us@@ her@@ es live mainly in icy waters , is no coincidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , whose sp@@ eck stuck on the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on point , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , they mature later - and age slowly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the volume increases much faster than its surface , through which the animal gets heat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the heat loss of one gram of mouse is much larger than with a gram of elephant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a very large animal should , on the other hand , invest his resources more in a long life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
building site in double pack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent session , the Municipal Council has focussed on issues relating to construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Council adopted Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently declared residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the real estate , par@@ cel@@ ing and development issues have been clari@@ fied and the moti@@ ons for surve@@ ying have been clari@@ fied , there is nothing more in the way for the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; StraÃ@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; SchÃ¶@@ nau @-@ West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Municipal Council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of SchÃ¶@@ nau , young families and sen@@ iors alike address . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was promised , building permits can immediately report in the town hall , and the allocation of the plots is expected to be advised in its September session . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to request further requests for the establishment of further commercial enterprises , together with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change its newly created land use plan in some areas only in the spring of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of under@@ time , the industrial area , which has already been designated there , is extended by two par@@ c@@ els in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt has benefited most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lÃ¤nder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether to keep money houses from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , admission to Britain is enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are just large US banks .
several banks have already announced plans to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 10,000 new jobs on the Main , the lobby association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; is expecting more than five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , is the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone as well as other important authorities , such as E@@ IO@@ PA &apos;s European insurance supervis@@ or and the risk corporate ES@@ R@@ B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly to the bank , &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lÃ¤nder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luxembourg disposed of a large fund sector , but also deterior@@ ated in the infrastructure of Dublin as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the city has light commercial properties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it is not that easy to find high quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lÃ¤nder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , rent for first @-@ class commercial properties is 50 percent higher than on the River Main . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Frankfurt has a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ranking of the company management Mer@@ cer the city is standing on number seven , Luxembourg at number 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my econom@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the power relations : in London , some 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry worked in London according to numbers of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a U.S. governing judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs , arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June Gilead was released from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the infrin@@ gement of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which occurred in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs called so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of the complaint filed on Thursday , U.S. officials Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead &apos;s claim to reduce costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ alize with Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck were covering one another and took possession of laboratory work , where Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir is based , the active ingredient in the Gilead &apos;s drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the US , troops supported that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troops supported by the United States have rec@@ ap@@ tured the full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after leaving the last IS fighters in the city , a group of speakers said on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the extract of the still remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city , are currently the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they freed over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are leading straight up by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 , paying 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , H@@ illary Clinton released its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated USD 5.@@ 3 million to the Clinton Foundation ; former Foreign Minister issued an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Senator Tim Kaiser from Virginia , published his tax declarations over the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ca@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign assistant Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Com@@ m@@ umps Ac@@ coun@@ tants , said CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax inspections are not finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ umps critic , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business deal@@ ings and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton already threw himself on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday , in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump sum@@ mon@@ ing his tax return . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , she spoke on the subject during a speech on the business in Mich@@ ig@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Politi@@ co has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , the Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industrial Con@@ glomer@@ ate had its headquarters here , was able to exchange Tr@@ ump to a meeting in order to exchange their tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to an audit of the I@@ RS , and he was afraid of voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax return until 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Clinton &apos;s , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Annual Report of the 2015 Clinton &apos;s Annual Report showed that these only USD 100 were referred to as wage , unlike most Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

con@@ doms with chim@@ pow@@ ders and fireworks boost Tanz@@ anian Ele@@ ph@@ ant protection
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going in settlements , throwing con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ li@@ pu@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had already had the idea for years , has intensified its funding by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania by using a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , many wood@@ p@@ ers have used to defend themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday is World Phone Day , dedicated to animal welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , being much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damaging the elephant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first two steps include illumin@@ ating the elephant with a torch , and the bubbles in a horn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body in a con@@ dom , whose end up to the ignition switch is turned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a knob and spra@@ ys fine dust on chi@@ ves into the air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a rule , a touch is already sufficient to chase the elephant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one last possibility constitutes a ver@@ fer who shoots a gold @-@ fired fire@@ work into the air , causing a loud , light explosion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
town council unanim@@ ously agrees : no new building at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment projects of business@@ men with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and assume - the retail trade in the core city is considered to be significantly exp@@ and@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the city council , however , unanim@@ ously rejected the motion for the construction of a shop on the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ kon@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamentally , we welcome new business@@ men , but at this location in exposed location on the bank of the Rhine this ki@@ osk does not fit . &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director breaks down Berlin hotel , because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin was not listed as an Israeli pre @-@ election because there were Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust story &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of country list of the hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country was not listed among the countries , which can be sum@@ mon@@ ed directly from the hotel room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the Kemp@@ inski Hotel B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocks him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff stated that the measure was a deliberate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason , which was behind it , triggered even more anger in the director . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the election will be deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed from this event .
that really is very sham@@ eful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that this in Germany has taken place in exactly this hotel chain , is even an even greater dis@@ grace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the internet , where people called the whole scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some were subordin@@ ated to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that there would have been the alleged claims of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; said it in another post that was pointed out that the hotel located on the noble Kur@@ fÃ¼r@@ st@@ end@@ amm is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly rejected all alle@@ gations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order to record Israel into the prompt list , &quot; the SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokesman for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it adds , that the country code has been added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
police uses tear gas &amp; rubber ra@@ ke against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; students gathered in Sa@@ o Paulo on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sa@@ o Paulo , when they gathered to fight against the reforms of the government for the public education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police put tear gas and rubber ra@@ fts against the demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , causing the police to put rubber ra@@ ins and tear gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State Sa@@ o Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the protest@@ ants were seen to spray Gra@@ ffi@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional president , Michel Tem@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went on the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rising to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the lifting of the sanctions , the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trading exchange between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been abol@@ ished , interest in Russian businesses grew strongly in the country , distributed the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trading rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , Russia &apos;s imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sales increase was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan escap@@ es from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year the Russian foreign representation amounted to about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , Iranian citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , only a few Russians attend Iran , something that the ambassador hopes to change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
search for witnesses : beverage market inv@@ aded in Wald@@ br@@ Ã¶l
a rob@@ bery event was carried out on Thursday evening at the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ Ã¶@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straÃe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the guard of a fire@@ arm three dark dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , then fled from the cler@@ k of the drink bar and then fled by a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much money has been captured , the police do not share . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetrators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters , so relatively small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market , and can be viewed poorly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the attack , the perpetrators must be sc@@ anned in direction Ger@@ ber@@ straÃe , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and fled from the gravel car park in front of the car park entrance , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who made observations at the time of tat@@ too ( at 7 : 45 p.m. ) , which are in connection with the rob@@ bery @-@ raid , should report strongly in the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer@@ time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and teenagers of the social educational day group / social group work of the Child Protection Society in Nuss@@ dorf , near MÃ¼h@@ lack@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first week of school holidays , the fun group was quartered in the quiet location of Hard@@ tw@@ Ã¤l@@ dle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , it went to B@@ iel with the visit of the stro@@ king zoo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special child leadership in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the hot days the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swim and sp@@ lash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; culinary children and car@@ ers were treated with their own preparations , such as the Sau@@ ge Sp@@ et@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ Ã¤n@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ Ã¼b@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in workshops , jewellery made of beads and stones created or made of wood is a Roman mill game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned home satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gateway of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ esh@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , four stages were overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all Mini@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the Ober@@ ministers round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy was offered a special pilgrimage destination for the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ saw , and Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt , went on their way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small ceremony in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and par@@ ted the pilgrims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Hor@@ b it was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Min@@ ster of Un@@ ser@@ er was standing and so the pilgrimage route took place from MÃ¼nster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening , depending on a short impulse with different prayers , songs and writing texts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is at Feld@@ crosses , chap@@ els or churches always made a rest to sing a song from a special pilgri@@ m song . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for overnight stays , parish homes of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty , hearty dinner and breakfast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the second day , Fur@@ tw@@ angen came to GÃ¼@@ ten@@ bach on the second day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tags on this point were taken on stage after St. Peter , which was the exhau@@ sting stretch of route , and had to ascend at first about 500 metres of altitude and then climbed again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening , the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the bathroom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the morning impulse on the 4th day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went to Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visi@@ bly relieved and happy , the Min@@ is met in the late afternoon at Freiburg cathedral and stepped through the gates of mercy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a small impulse , God was grateful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening mass in MÃ¼nster , Min@@ is welcomed the Min@@ is by coach Markus Ober@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next day , there was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the afternoon , we went back to Hor@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes back home when Br@@ ite Gold rings for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the role of his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y , who took the legend when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from his favorite New Zealand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking win while Ho@@ y scored the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they repeated the trick , after in March at the Train World Championships in London , despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff .
they did this in time as a Hin@@ du .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ ys retired a gap , the Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has un@@ folded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner set an Olympic record in qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ ands won the first lap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his lap he fell short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of strategy made a great part of the transformation , with the outward going in a higher gear to slow it down and to allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they got onto the podium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am only here to do my best , and to make a name for myself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final round , we set up an Olympic record and the World Champion defeated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the 2012 triumph at the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des admitted that he intentionally fell on the train after a weak start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he returned this statement back later , and there was no opposition from England &apos;s ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the UK flags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three months , we have come together as a team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did so badly with so many world titles , that it was incredible to win at the Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which won seven out of 10 titles in Beijing and London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would be for Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y who was born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave ( Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kenn@@ y comes next in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will start over three days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 year old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels a little lonely , to win alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had cont@@ ested yesterday with representatives before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie archives in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UK team is relying on his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games , and get a med@@ als of med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a truly exceptional display of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drama in the background , such as the resignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director , played in the midst of sex@@ ism and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ aces as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if one sees the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks quite like the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; future of the melt from Port@@ land , due to the elimination of the energy contract &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria , as well as hundreds of workers of workers - stand on the game as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby lift up all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a subsi@@ dy for 20 years , runs out in November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 2,000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ co@@ a in Port@@ land stand on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not less than 2000 workplaces , direct and indirect , could be at risk in a closure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it could come to Dom@@ ino@@ Eff@@ ort , as the melt rot@@ ates about 10 percent of the entire generating production of Victori@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 Al@@ co@@ a closed the Point Henry melting , which last year led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ co@@ a in Port@@ land loses money , and risks a closure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe , shared that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ co@@ a and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p retain smaller portions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L furthermore testified that the contracts were called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contracts have a period of 12 months , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point on , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all potential impacts on the income on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that it has already depreci@@ ated the value of contracts in its annual balance of $ 18@@ 7 million , in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ a said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the enam@@ el or to ensure the supply of the sm@@ el@@ ting &quot; does not interfere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US company said that 2010 had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have come into force from November this year even if it is still an explanation of why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry , before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses approx . 600 MW and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of power every year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator it would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan is on the cover of the popular September edition of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York announced on Thursday announced the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) a critical reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases of Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the popular show@@ bi@@ z on@@ ward and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most c@@ lich@@ Ã© story of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ ause brought the phrase , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls participate in this publicity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of car@@ dan has begun with certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her what the vo@@ gue cover concerns ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for themselves .
the September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles more like a fashion magazine than a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were advertisement from the 8@@ 32 pages of the WÃ¤l@@ zers 6@@ 15 pages adver@@ ts ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover @-@ stars is expected to be so long @-@ awaited , that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still si@@ ghted before the official announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women , who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , model &quot; than &quot; models , &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oscar winner and brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the little chance that Mr@@ s Jen@@ ner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation , is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to shoot a good snapshot video ( even if everything is true for Jen@@ ner ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are truly talented women , who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had been publishing Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers does not like success to everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers was always tense in the fashion world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these feelings en@@ ra@@ ged up again , when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , on the mis@@ chief , seems to be passing by at the point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes publicity for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their pay@@ wall apps , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she sells her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in her free time she is seen in Reality TV , probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each year , there are 16@@ 0.000 inhabitants each year &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the state &apos;s auxiliary services are rejected annually by the community centres , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further mean cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy persons , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected by their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already fully utilized , are ready for further cuts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal agents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Director of the Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ r@@ ell District Council , said that the last survey of the National Council of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people were rejected each year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ r@@ ell said that without a repe@@ al of the resolution of the Federal Government , the situation would only become worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people from important services you need will be rejected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the average by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of hel@@ pless people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we urge the General Prosecutor and Justice Minister as well as Sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately cancel these short@@ cuts , so that the people will be able to get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid on the national average . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time to look at the needs of community centers and their communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign was indic@@ ted after staff allegedly drew gun
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ ump Campa@@ ign was accused of alleged in@@ action , having been informed that their campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a fire@@ arm on an employee while they were on the road in February . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this federal state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i ordered to have waited for months for the matter to be maintained internally , before he realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; moved a pi@@ sto@@ l , put his right hand finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mmed the race in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his charge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having compla@@ ined to local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i found that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not have to be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admitted B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indictment only lasted two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate inv@@ oked a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; were to take action if his rival would be elected to H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign clearly showed that the media had torn his words out of context , and that he would not inc@@ ur violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ is Compla@@ int demanded compensation from the campaign for violation of duty of care and Philip , because of bodily injury and dying of psychological damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you very much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to contact Philip , as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not responded to calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has led a controversial campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proceedings are B@@ ordin@@ i v. Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : poll@@ s in front of countries elections : losing the SPD and the CD@@ U
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U are notable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gave representative opinion poll@@ s of the opinion research institute In@@ sa , for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to face the head of government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the survey , the party is only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third place is disputed among the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite slight losses , the Green Party was reluct@@ ant to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag in spite of its slight losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 3 percent , N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the poll@@ s , the poll@@ s of the survey showed only 23 percent ( Choice 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they still smile behind the Gre@@ ens at 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 14 percent , the Af@@ D would be represented for the first time in the unloading house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to 2011 , the F@@ DP could hope to return to a return with 5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the success@@ ors dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram , and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was thicker and bigger , so it wasn &apos;t good in the hand either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , it was rather unk@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initially , the built @-@ in memory used to be eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a few euros lovers can buy the devices still on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Inter@@ Net Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer trade fair in Hannover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in the western pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was reachable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the access to websites was possible by HTML @-@ browser , albeit very slowly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile operated like a laptop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , a small keyboard and a black and white screen found themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prize was pretty proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August 1996 , no one could imagine that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , everything is different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smart phones are a success story , albeit not for Nokia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mobile phone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , suppliers , who all came a lot later than Nokia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for very many people everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sold around 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple accounted for 5@@ 55 million copies of this alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worldwide sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to do this , the well @-@ running business of the countless app suppliers and telecommunications corporations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs on Mac @-@ World announced the launch of the iPhone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator , everything is easy to use by touch screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apple &apos;s triumph@@ ant start , even today , the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ Ber@@ ry , who dominated the market , had a look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers , such as Samsung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 years after his invention , the smartphone is a matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to put away the Smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , permanent availability is considered to be a curse and blessing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ ath@@ row will not only bring renewal and prosperity to our local communities and all over London , but throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it was the biggest attraction in He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London when we took a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Olympics brought great advantages to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that will be achieved again , by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such people who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ row is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was told that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two @-@ f@@ ellers were wrong in 2012 , and they will also lie wrong with He@@ ath@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for a single infrastructure project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , Â£ 2@@ 11 billion in wit@@ ty growth and a legacy of skills and employment to leave both the airport and the whole UK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , who has implemented a Â£ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget from T@@ 5 - five years in succession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by Â£ 16 billion in private investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus and Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ er &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a software manufacturer trying to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; Cat and M@@ ouse game &quot; is the same for companies that make money with online advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a B@@ log@@ post in which it r@@ ushed that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ commerci@@ alize advertising on the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop page would change the encoding with regard to its advertising display to make it difficult to detect display blocks that are part of the page advertisement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a blog post , the spokesman of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the line @-@ lo@@ cking open source community and the conver@@ ters has been underway since the invention of advertising lock@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embark@@ ed on the fight is a powerful indication of how wor@@ rying , display lock@@ ers have become the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; nearly four times as much 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts 84 percent of advertising revenues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company has put it on desktop PCs on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a narr@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; Ad Pre@@ fer@@ en@@ ent@@ ool , &quot; to have more control over it than adverti@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block &apos;s new filters were wor@@ rying , because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a spokesman of Facebook in an email communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , so instead we have focused on developer tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to get more control over the hands of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman suspected of suicide on s@@ wis@@ s highway
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the night , the victim was on the highway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a woman in the early hours of the morning , the police ev@@ okes suspicion of suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident occurred on the A1 , near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud , shortly after midnight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of despair , &quot; hit the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , which was passed by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she still died on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police to report these as well as any witnesses of the incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative method was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , distributed Gil@@ les Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter to Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last five years , two similar cases prove that drivers are not to be held accoun@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in each of the two cases , where a person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walk@@ eth in the middle of the night on the free@@ way as it was in the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after having killed and killed a man who lay in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street , took the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman responded to a justified fashion -- and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; totally extraordinary and un@@ predictable situation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once hab@@ itable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists at the God@@ dar@@ d Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble climate scientists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have re@@ ared with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once @-@ similar conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , ground @-@ like atmosphere and slowly moved forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planet presumably showed more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to shelter life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent weaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to the sun almost two months long , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io explained in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than the earth today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model produced a history of Venus , which resembles the evolution previously assumed by planet scientists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billions years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their oceans evapor@@ ated , and their water vap@@ or was burned out by ultra@@ violet light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as their hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a fatal greenhouse effect -- Venus , the way we know it today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy steps back as coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Patrick Roy joined the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che as trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the summer , I was thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth to bring it to a higher level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and vice president of ho@@ ckey operations must be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also has to have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions , which influence the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sak@@ ic , who was hired by Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation , and wish him the best for the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during his debut season , Roy won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he led the club to 112 points and took the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was hit in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs from Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post @-@ season in any of the last two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 2015 @-@ 16 season , the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ th@@ ee@@ pers take conversations , strike out strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fight for re@@ pay for North Sea workers will be exposed while all the armed parties sit on the table for a new round of discussion , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against oil field service Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the present strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will stop a few full day sessions in the next few weeks , beginning next year to address the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , Wood Group has reduced the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore customers in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that additional cuts to the company have the required space , in order to get through the market down@@ turn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shell has dismissed many thousands of people and plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Scottish Parliament committee , Dave Anderson , met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes ever taken place in the North Sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea in comparison with an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rate of rotation of stars in the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the Ple@@ j@@ ade star cluster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates , and in what context the rot@@ ational periods are standing with planet creation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star @-@ enh@@ ancements , learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years away from the Earth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at peak rotation rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars rep@@ el large amounts of star @-@ win@@ ches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this win@@ ch travels through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest generation of rot@@ ational rates points out , that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars turn slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , while faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still much ahead of us that we would like to know more about how , when and why stars slow@@ ed their rot@@ ational rates and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported on their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades rot@@ ational rates that will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball player ki@@ cks off
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball player in the best days from Base to Base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his emotional release announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will be wearing the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys on 12 August against the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to join , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game Leader of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2007 , his signature has been signed by 27 million US dollars annually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will act as consultant and youth coach - with a full salary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 H@@ its and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and Yan@@ ke@@ es he made some mil@@ estones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players present similar values in the most important statistics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old will not be admitted to the Hall &apos;s Hall of glory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - in the field , his appearance was beyond the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; admitted having banned ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games by the end of 2014 due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect , for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favour for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his farewell days , too , are not silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while many bas@@ eball legends get the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez frequently had to sit on the bench . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job ent@@ ails the attempt to win any game , &quot; et@@ ched Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle course in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Poland &apos;s wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Go@@ z@@ hin@@ sky were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions this news is coming to an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was detected in Ch@@ en , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court of Sport CA@@ S confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , only 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en had to take part in the runs over 50 m of free @-@ style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing has been requested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigation , &quot; stated X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court of CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the sanc@@ tioning of athletes with positive cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old , went on the offensive again in the night of Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; declared the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the report , the forbidden substance is to act as a blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also be positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v reported to him immediately , with criticism of the bul@@ letin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes did not pull the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for instance , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically @-@ dop@@ ing nation must not participate in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the &quot; Adrian Go@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both deny the intake , but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the athletes start , Dan@@ ek@@ ova &apos;s case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Federation of IA@@ AF was prohibited from the start of the entire Russian team , except for systematic dop@@ ing , but also the runners in Kenya produce numerous bad news in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in swimming , the early depar@@ tures in China had also taken care of violent disputes between athletes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t picked up the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sun y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m free , I want to hand over myself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Sun was at the center of a confrontation with Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sun had been tested positively in 2014 with the Chinese champi@@ onships , but had to sit down only a three @-@ month lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dat@@ ac@@ lau : as per@@ fi@@ de , h@@ ack@@ ers squee@@ ze their ran@@ som &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programmers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeting companies , and they are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a recent survey by the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surve@@ yed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , partially multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som sal@@ aries required by the perpetrators , in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , the perpetrators are speci@@ alizing in attacks in corporate networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are successful there , the potential to replace ran@@ som is much higher than in private users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2008 , most of the paint programs were designed to send advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the perpetrators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks happened quickly over the past few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it searches specifically for un@@ altered files such as WordPress , Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these files en@@ code the ran@@ som@@ ware , and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but where private users play the personal photo database on the game , companies need sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production is shut down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the damage comes out when a ran@@ som@@ ware is beating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 percent of German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to inter@@ rupt the operation , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , several hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say the victims : do not pay , you just promote the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay , will get their data back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the stand@@ still in operation , it is difficult for managers to reject the claim of the perpetrators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the h@@ ack@@ ers , in turn , know this and try to build up a good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a recent study , the investig@@ ators of F @-@ Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mailing and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if individuals are redeemed for payments of only a few hundred Euro , companies have to deal with hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data back un@@ encrypted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware recovery , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus service SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is more likely , however , that it is three or four people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the programmers sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the malware kits have been created by the malware itself , providing advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the black@@ ers then search for further h@@ ack@@ ers , to spread the newly bought software among the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we live in a service economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so one logs in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Payment is processed per in@@ ert calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals then instruc@@ t sp@@ amm@@ ers to spread &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is known by many companies that better secure their data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust ran@@ som@@ ware to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data is no longer a threat to successful recovery , the perpetrators are threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , the perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things on the internet of things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference , the security researchers demonstrated how to control a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating may well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the perpetr@@ ator then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one for all eventu@@ alities
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ Ã© and even the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the rear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials of the interior are well @-@ processed and have a pleasant effect , only the upper side of the cockpit is falling apart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l on raised and 10@@ 26 l available in reverse back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like chin chairs and thus offer storage space that is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp will speed up the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in large @-@ speed ranges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he should do his job a little qui@@ eter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the daily consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km is enjoyable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is another engine type , with a 1.5 @-@ liter petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driving behavior is well balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tested top variant &quot; Executive , &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city emergency brake assist is one of the security systems ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane assistant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates , because he over@@ sees many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very reliable , the remote light coach operates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the intelligent speed control responds to the traffic sign detection and throt@@ tles the speed , if necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation , app integration and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest , and are therefore something aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : crash@@ es on passenger jet@@ ty
an Air@@ line is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger lift .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because a liability is conceivable only for hazards that are typical of aviation , the DÃ¼sseldorf Higher Regional Court ar@@ gues ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the fall , the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken down a kne@@ ec@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the accident could have occurred everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the airline did not have to pay compensation for the man .
case of illness : when the organis@@ er pays
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after their trip , sick holi@@ day@@ makers will only get money back when the cause of the disease is without doubt in the hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of guests have proven to show the same symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the trial , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting during the second day of their tur@@ tle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she spent almost all the holidays in the room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their illness brought the tourists back to a defective sewage treatment plant , which supposedly contaminated the sea@@ water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family was the view , the trip was so lacking - and compla@@ ined against the organizers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in court , the pla@@ inti@@ ffs did not have any success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , the treatment plant was indeed defective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before the pla@@ inti@@ ff &apos;s departure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until then , he had to assume that the sea water was fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he did not hurt his duties , so the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially in the samples of the water , no im@@ puri@@ ties were found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disease of several hotel guests , possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were dise@@ ased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re said , after the violence done by refugees in WÃ¼rzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state must be so@@ ber and decided at the same time to react to terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and sch@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this triumph , we will not treat the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if convic@@ ts would have to leave the country more quickly , but increase security and strengthen the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re , plans to implement proposals to the Bundestag election in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced further personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ fourth magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting terrorism must again be under punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ fire will be am@@ ended in such a way that it complic@@ ates the purchase of weapons on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y of sec@@ ret@@ aries for doctors shall remain , according to de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re &apos;s words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the endanger@@ ment of the citizens can be reduced , he said with views about psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the minister maintains a better social support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the prosecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Gabriel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister clearly expressed himself against action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was an ear cow@@ ard for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban , and the abolition of double citizenship was rejected earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a general prohibition of full wear , it is un@@ constitutional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one cannot forbi@@ d everything that one refuses , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talk can be said about rules , for example in road traffic or for witnesses to court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green boss Sim@@ one Peter designed the minister to simulate action and ability to act with new anti @-@ terror packages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fle@@ et pro@@ verb@@ s and a sharpen@@ ing of residence law bring people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better transport flow on the motorway toll motorway
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it st@@ owed regularly on the circum@@ fer@@ ential road , here a picture of November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this should change : the legal framework should be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is good news for all the car drivers who are standing in traffic on the outskirts of traffic every night , if they drive via the auto@@ bahn ( A 43 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , road construction is extended by 700 metres in the area between Hammer Street and Wes@@ er StraÃe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drivers can then drive directly from the hammer , right on the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage : traffic shares early on , thus improving the total run@@ time on the busy section of the road 51 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district , representing MÃ¼nster @-@ West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drivers on the train station on the feeder are annoying , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ stage reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes beyond . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 , shortly before the River Wes@@ er StraÃe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from here , the traffic is guided only one lane through the motorway bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the second track had to be rec@@ laimed in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge no longer has the necessary load force , in order to absorb heavy @-@ gauge traffic in particular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the resulting work@@ station will continue , the competent regional company cannot fail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , with years to expect , the bridge has an official rest period up to 20@@ 34 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the extension of the legal dispute , the country consciously selected the weaker time during the school holidays because with disabilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday , on the construction site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
intercultural Travel : cultural Off@@ ers for Schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre now plan a music project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with a mig@@ rational and refugee background , to visit cultural institutions in MÃ¼nster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a performance of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the boy Theater MÃ¼nster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the Association of N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students visited the small house between eleven and 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , has the opportunity to visit schools with welcome classes as part of this project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the students in the class had come to MÃ¼nster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nonetheless , so the press release of the boy Theater MÃ¼nster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background should be able to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dancing , acting and music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for repair
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weather has made the star @-@ snow@@ flakes in south@@ western Germany a stroke in the night to Friday , but there is still hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hope is on the night , on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the star@@ ry scales are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening you roll around etern@@ ally , at night you are awake for hours , morning is already far before the alarm bells no longer think of sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten per cent experience their sleep frequently or permanently as un@@ restor@@ ative . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders occur ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind it , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ GÃ¼nter We@@ gener , member of the board of directors of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and S@@ leep Medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what one understands for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an entry and sleeping disorder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; owing to their lack of sleep , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind this can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not seldom , the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it can be , that different factors are thank@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , anyone who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can be ill , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to smile about everyday problems and worries , We@@ ak gives an example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , advises We@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the draw@@ back can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or bodily discomfort such as stomach or headache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to allevi@@ ate sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medication - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , there is hardly any vac@@ ant sleep doctor in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Medical Center of the Char@@ itÃ© University Medicine Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , you should consult the GP for sleeping problems at first , advises We@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can clarify with studies , whether the problems have a physical cause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who should go to the fl@@ ab@@ or , and what happens ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for snor@@ ing with breathing separ@@ ators , for example snor@@ ing with respiratory trac@@ ers , for sleep @-@ conver@@ ters or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , you don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you should normally spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after glu@@ ing , one goes to bed at its normal time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose g@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a camera is drawing at the ceiling to sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can those affected handle the problems ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are quite a lot of adjusting screws , where you can get a better sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ ak counts : regular sleep and stand @-@ up times , not sleeping long in bed , do not sleep on the day , avoid television to sleep , avoid alcohol and not at night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Facebook , the former German float Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed their dis@@ appointing end of the DS@@ V teams at Olymp@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time at the world champi@@ onships in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the former DS@@ V athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has set up protected from his ex @-@ team mates via Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 â¬ and a jungle @-@ king 15@@ 0.000 â¬ should not be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conveyor system in swimming sport is bad , whereas the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not even look closely at the subject of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler had to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is exactly how you should keep it with countries , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who are not able to control a certain amount of time before World Cup / OS by independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; says the election ham@@ burger , who now operates an ice cream par@@ lor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of Bag@@ gage arrested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; professional thi@@ eves at the airport , DÃ¼sseldorf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , civil prosecution of the DÃ¼sseldorf police took the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the suspect , as a gang , had committed several bags of hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and luggage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants in the area of the airport of D@@ us@@ sel@@ dorf discovered a gang known to the police officers from the past theft of theft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two women and two men have committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July , and have worked in a collaborative and particularly professional manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Speci@@ alists of the Cri@@ mean Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can prove the thi@@ eves , who have been specially travelled to Germany for the purpose of the crimes committed in Germany , to prove four acts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , they had spent more than 15,000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old buildings , some lin@@ den bro@@ o@@ ks , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in appears at first sight , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one walks along the road from east to west , one passes on play@@ grounds , a fresh @-@ coated kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the facade of a grey house someone has ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be torn down , a house with high windows and 13@@ 3 new apartments will be built here until 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in , are , however , illustrated in recent weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented lease contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior cur@@ ator Henkel has spoken out several times for a hard action of the police against the project , the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after three weeks of official statements , the police pat@@ rolled out official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site on 22 June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , construction workers completed the rooms on behalf of the unknown home owners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and one day later police and construction workers moved from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain vor@@ m late i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who plays three children here mainly from the police presence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the residents of the building projects , they share the worry of rising rent and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not sound like a Kiev , who had a majority of police protection against the v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gap between the Berlin interior and the police between house owners and their neighbors , obviously , does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which also today has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them almost the entire Main@@ zer Street close to the R@@ Ä«@@ ga . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the Main@@ zer was cleared under large police force in a regular road battle , many of the projects in the R@@ Ä«@@ ga were leg@@ alized and partly inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , in recent years , the district has become a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tive ber@@ liner from all over the world : now residents of GDR times and former house @-@ occup@@ ants share their area with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the new buildings in the R@@ Ä«@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : they are recognized by e@@ jected disks or freshly painted facades , which were thrown with paint bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often , together with the words &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as bodily injury , according to statistics , are borne almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the off@@ ences make tangible damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived for 17 years in a rented house next to the disputed 94 , there is no talk of in@@ security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it comes to violence , it is wei@@ ght@@ lifting : people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not destined to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the famous burning cars , too , are no longer available in Riga . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the studied architect her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of one another than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately drawn into the R@@ Ä«@@ ga Stra@@ it - and stayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why it was so important that the residents got back their road : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by means of fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former building blocks that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is , ultimately , con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people living here are rather people who are not so good , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t approve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall we do , if one never listen to anyone ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who anno@@ y themselves about colour bombs , the skin @-@ projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub where there is a bad way to complain about noise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all persons presented only with first names have asked to not be called with their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee agency
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le , is the contact person for integration and organizer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she is a social worker on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of administration , Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups Refu@@ ge@@ es , Administration , Auth@@ orities and anyone else involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the jeal@@ ous Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ sau , which has a problem above all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ed than rather on the multitude of desired areas of responsibility - were meant to be purpos@@ eful when the administration wanted to write the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , a dream @-@ like wool mil@@ k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but administrative work is not her central area , meaning Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , it is about organizing , working with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for three years , it has fixed a 50 percent point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soon , new containers will be available at Was@@ en@@ straÃe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been a serious problem for some time now , to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been acknowledged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the connection provision , the municipalities are responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to under@@ mine the refugees in their own or hired living rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the responsibility changes from the District Office to the Commune and Job@@ center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some time , the search has been very difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , it does not work so far that one is dependent on private apartments , such as Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , common dwell@@ ings must be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , new containers will soon be installed in the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but only with apartments , it is not done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to a fixed lead , there are plac@@ ements , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ pers for refugees and migrants who need to be frozen or furnished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many work in the building yard or help house master , accomplish char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she hopes that working for the community leads to a positive external effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , work does not only mean work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ ces and Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it needs offerings such as sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
professional courses are ra@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , administration and honorary members also jump here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to explain to the refugees that it is just taking time and they can spend time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who at some point had the feeling that he couldn &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , he could not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are problem cases , the customer says honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a difficult question : do the two have fear of radi@@ cal@@ isation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine customers tell quite clearly what some &quot; nai@@ ve &quot; might be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the hel@@ pers are sensi@@ ti@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents , too , are subject to the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have the fear that the attacks brought them completely in demand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , main and honorary members must look for activities on the spot and in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this context , they always have a background that soon a new shock to refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does Germany need an upper limit ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to answer this question clearly , politics are afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , it is unfair to place them on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no new refugees , that would be able to relax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach@@ s are already busy , to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chim@@ dorf : intru@@ der searched with helicop@@ ters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for about one hour , the police helicopter flew off several areas - un@@ successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday morning , two unknown men came forci@@ bly into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in Lin@@ den@@ weg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants surprised the two , and hit the un@@ hol@@ den in the escape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters large , well @-@ mas@@ ked , wore both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded cartridges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they fled to the city centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the F@@ ahn@@ dung , the police took several strips of stripes as well as a police helicopter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the F@@ ahn@@ ging proceeded without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the unknown , in fact , fell close to the apartment or at their escape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Baden @-@ WÃ¼rttemberg : police investigating cra@@ cker attack on snack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an attack on a Ul@@ m Imb@@ iss , the police decide against six susp@@ ects from the ro@@ cker environment because of severe land@@ peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of housing searches , evidence and toxic@@ ity were ensured , the police announced on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police in July , around 20 mas@@ ked men had thrown bottles and stones against the window of a snack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , they should be attacked two guests and have a slightly injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they fled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the snack bar and adjacent building there was a damage of 10@@ 000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the investig@@ ators , there is a dispute in the Ul@@ m Ro@@ cker@@ mi@@ lieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ThÃ¼r@@ ingen : Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec came closer to the turnover billion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Asia , the demand for medical technology in Asia has stimulated the sales of Carl Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first nine months of the financial year , consolidated sales rose by 6.@@ 7 percent to 7@@ 9@@ 8.@@ 6 million euros , as the listed company announced on Friday in Jena . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Asian business grew dispro@@ portion@@ ately by 17.@@ 1 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to interim results of 8@@ 9.@@ 5 million euros , earnings before interest and taxes increased to â¬ 1@@ 10.@@ 5 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this financial year , the Jena @-@ based medical technology company wants to exceed the sales mark of one billion euros , the Executive Board re@@ affir@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec manufactures equipment and equipment for medical practices and clinics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , which belongs to the optics and electronics group Carl Zei@@ ss ( Ober@@ kochen ) , employs about 3000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
